AB  - The host microbiome can be considered an ecological community of microbes present inside a complex and dynamic host environment. The host is under selective pressure to ensure that its microbiome remains beneficial. The host can impose a range of ecological filters including the immune response that can influence the assembly and composition of the microbial community. How the host immune response interacts with the within-microbiome community dynamics to affect the assembly of the microbiome has been largely unexplored. We present here a mathematical framework to elucidate the role of host immune response and its interaction with the balance of ecological interactions types within the microbiome community. We find that highly mutualistic microbial communities characteristic of high community density are most susceptible to changes in immune control and become invasion prone as host immune control strength is increased. Whereas highly competitive communities remain relatively stable in resisting invasion to changing host immune control. Our model reveals that the host immune control can interact in unexpected ways with a microbial community depending on the prevalent ecological interactions types for that community. We stress the need to incorporate the role of host-control mechanisms to better understand microbiome community assembly and stability.

AB  - The evolution of a cultural trait may be affected by niche construction, or changes in the selective environment of that trait due to the inheritance of other cultural traits that make up a cultural background. This study investigates the evolution of a cultural trait, such as the acceptance of the idea of contraception, that is both vertically and horizontally transmitted within a homogeneous social network. Individuals may conform to the norm, and adopters of the trait have fewer progeny than others. In addition, adoption of this trait is affected by a vertically transmitted aspect of the cultural background, such as the preference for high or low levels of education. Our model shows that such cultural niche construction can facilitate the spread of traits with low Darwinian fitness while providing an environment that counteracts conformity to norms. In addition, niche construction can facilitate the 'demographic transition' by making reduced fertility socially accepted. & COPY; 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - This study deals with the problem of the population shrinking in habitats affected by aging and excessive migration outflows. First, a control-oriented population dynamics model was proposed that catches the effect of depopulation. The model also includes the effect of spatial interaction-driven migration flows on population size. The resulting model is a non-homogeneous ordinary differential equation. It includes such phenomena that are important from the control point of view, such as the influence of migration costs on population dynamics, the impact of aging on population size, or the effect of the habitats' carrying capacity on migration flows. Based on the model, controllability conditions are formulated and a control strategy was developed that is meant to avoid the depopulation of the habitat. The control method acts on the migration costs to achieve the control goal and requires only population size measurements. Simulation measurements are presented in the paper to show the effectiveness of the proposed modeling and control methods.(c) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - We consider a game theoretical model of kleptoparasitic interaction between two individuals, the Owner and the Intruder. The Owner is in possession of a resource and must decide whether to defend the resource against the Intruder or flee. If the Owner defends, the Intruder must decide whether to fight with the Owner or flee. The outcome of the fight depends on the hunger of the individuals, the hungrier the individual is, the more likely they are to win the fight. We consider three scenarios: (a) both individuals know their own and their opponent's hunger, (b) individuals only know their own hunger but not that of their opponent, and (c) individuals do not know their own nor the opponent's hunger levels. We determine Nash equilibrium strategies in each scenario. We conclude that Owner is generally willing to defend more often than the Intruder is willing to attack. Also, the Intruder's payoff is largest in the full information case; but the Owner may benefit in the no information or partial information cases when the cost of the fight is neither too large nor too small.

AB  - We revisit the model by Wiser et al. (2013), which describes how the mean fitness increases over time due to beneficial mutations in Lenski's long-term evolution experiment. We develop the model further both conceptually and mathematically. Conceptually, we describe the experiment with the help of a Cannings model with mutation and selection, where the latter includes diminishing returns epistasis. The analysis sheds light on the growth dynamics within every single day and reveals a runtime effect, that is, the shortening of the daily growth period with increasing fitness; and it allows to clarify the contribution of epistasis to the mean fitness curve. Mathematically, we explain rigorous results in terms of a law of large numbers (in the limit of infinite population size and for a certain asymptotic parameter regime), and present approximations based on heuristics and supported by simulations for finite populations.

AB  - We describe an iterated game between two players, in which the payoff is to survive a number of steps. Expected payoffs are probabilities of survival. A key feature of the game is that individuals have to survive on their own if their partner dies. We consider individuals with hardwired, unconditional behaviors or strategies. When both players are present, each step is a symmetric two-player game. The overall survival of the two individuals forms a Markov chain. As the number of iterations tends to infinity, all probabilities of survival decrease to zero. We obtain general, analytical results for n-step payoffs and use these to describe how the game changes as n increases. In order to predict changes in the frequency of a cooperative strategy over time, we embed the survival game in three different models of a large, well mixed population. Two of these models are deterministic and one is stochastic. Offspring receive their parent's type without modification and fitnesses are determined by the game. Increasing the number of iterations changes the prospects for cooperation. All models become neutral in the limit (n -> infinity). Further, if pairs of cooperative individuals survive together with high probability, specifically higher than for any other pair and for either type when it is alone, then cooperation becomes favored if the number of iterations is large enough. This holds regardless of the structure of pairwise interactions in a single step. Even if the single-step interaction is a Prisoner's Dilemma, the cooperative type becomes favored. Enhanced survival is crucial in these iterated evolutionary games: if players in pairs start the game with a fitness deficit relative to lone individuals, the prospects for cooperation can become even worse than in the case of a single-step game.

AB  - A finite-population, discrete-generation model of cultural evolution is described, in which multiple discrete traits are transmitted independently. In this model, each newborn may inherit a trait from multiple cultural parents. Transmission fails with a positive probability unlike in population genetics. An ancestral process simulating the cultural genealogy of a sample of individuals is derived for this model. This ancestral process, denoted by M-, is shown to be dual to a process M+ describing the change in the frequency of a trait. The age-frequency spectrum is defined as a two-dimensional array whose (i, k) element is the expected number of distinct cultural traits introduced k generations ago and now carried by i individuals in a sample of a particular size n. Numerical calculations reveal that the age-frequency spectrum and related metrics undergo a critical transition from a phase with a moderate number of young, rare traits to a phase with numerous very old, common traits when the expected number of cultural parents per individual exceeds one. It is shown that M+ and M- converge to branching or deterministic processes, depending on the way population size tends to infinity, and these limiting processes bear some duality relationships. The critical behavior of the original processes M+ and M- is explained in terms of a phase transition of the branching processes. Using the results of the limiting processes in combination, we derive analytical formulae that well approximate the age-frequency spectrum and also other metrics. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - At time 0, start a time-continuous binary branching process, where particles give birth to a single particle independently (at a possibly time-dependent rate) and die independently (at a possibly time-dependent and age-dependent rate). A particular case is the classical birth-death process. Stop this process at time T > 0. It is known that the tree spanned by the N tips alive at time T of the tree thus obtained (called a reduced tree or coalescent tree) is a coalescent point process (CPP), which basically means that the depths of interior nodes are independent and identically distributed (iid). Now select each of the N tips independently with probability y (Bernoulli sample). It is known that the tree generated by the selected tips, which we will call the Bernoulli sampled CPP, is again a CPP. Now instead, select exactly k tips uniformly at random among the N tips (a k-sample). We show that the tree generated by the selected tips is a mixture of Bernoulli sampled CPPs with the same parent CPP, over some explicit distribution of the sampling probability y. An immediate consequence is that the genealogy of a k-sample can be obtained by the realization of k random variables, first the random sampling probability Y and then the k - 1 node depths which are iid conditional on Y = y.

AB  - In cooperative breeding systems individuals invest in the reproductive success of others. In this paper, we study the emergence of cooperative breeding systems in which reproductively active breeders receive investment from reproductively non-active helpers. Our goal is to understand how the division of an investment between male and female components of breeder fitness (i.e. the helper sex-allocation strategy) influences the emergence of cooperative breeding itself. Using mathematical models, we arrive at expressions for the inclusive-fitness advantage of helpful behaviour that generalize previous work. These expressions assume an ecologically stable environment, and that breeders make evolutionarily stable sex-allocation decisions. We find that, when breeders are extremely resource limited, the sex-allocation strategy used by a helper can be a key determinant in the success of helpful alleles. This finding, however, is restricted to cases in which helpers have access to intermediate levels of resources. Surprisingly, when helpers can make only a small investment in a recipient the division of the investment matters only very little to advantage of help. By contrast when resources are extremely abundant, we obtain the unsurprising result that the manner in which resources are allocated has little influence on the emergence of help. When breeders have access to intermediate levels of resources we find increasing relatedness can, in certain cases, inhibit the emergence of help. We also find that increasing the amount of resources available to a breeder can impede help as well. Both of these counter-intuitive results are mediated by evolutionary responses in breeder sex allocation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - There is evidence that multiple stable equilibrium states are possible in real-life ecological systems. Phenomenological mathematical models which exhibit such properties can be constructed rather straightforwardly. For instance, for a predator-prey system this result can be achieved through the use of non-monotonic functional response for the predator. However, while formal formulation of such a model is not a problem, the biological justification for such functional responses and models is usually inconclusive.
   In this note, we explore a conjecture that a multitude of equilibrium states can be caused by an adaptation of animal behaviour to changes of environmental conditions. In order to verify this hypothesis, we consider a simple predator-prey model, which is a straightforward extension of the classic Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model. In this model, we made an intuitively transparent assumption that the prey can change a mode of behaviour in response to the pressure of predation, choosing either "safe" of "risky" (or "business as usual") behaviour. In order to avoid a situation where one of the modes gives an absolute advantage, we introduce the concept of the "cost of a policy" into the model. A simple conceptual two-dimensional predator-prey model, which is minimal with this property, and is not relying on odd functional responses, higher dimensionality or behaviour change for the predator, exhibits two stable co-existing equilibrium states with basins of attraction separated by a separatrix of a saddle point.

AB  - We reconsider the Moran model in continuous time with population size N, two allelic types, and selection. We introduce a new particle representation, which we call the labelled Moran model, and which has the same distribution of type frequencies as the original Moran model, provided the initial values are chosen appropriately. In the new model, individuals are labelled 1, 2,..., N; neutral resampling events may take place between arbitrary labels, whereas selective events only occur in the direction of increasing labels. With the help of elementary methods only, we not only recover fixation probabilities, but also obtain detailed insight into the number and nature of the selective events that play a role in the fixation process forward in time.

AB  - The concept of the average effect of an allele pervades much of evolutionary population genetics. In this context the average effect of an allele is often considered as the main component of the "fitness'' of that allele. It is widely believed that, if this fitness component for an allele is positive, then the frequency of this allele will increase, at least for one generation in discrete-time models. In this note we show that this is not necessarily the case since the average effect of an allele on fitness may be different from its marginal additive fitness even in a one-locus setting in non-random-mating populations.

AB  - We analyze the evolution of a multidimensional quantitative trait in a class-structured focal species interacting with other species in a wider metacommunity. The evolutionary dynamics in the focal species as well as the ecological dynamics of the whole metacommunity is described as a continuoustime process with birth, physiological development, dispersal, and death given as rates that can depend on the state of the whole metacommunity. This can accommodate complex local community and global metacommunity environmental feedbacks owing to inter- and intra-specific interactions, as well as local environmental stochastic fluctuations. For the focal species, we derive a fitness measure for a mutant allele affecting class-specific trait expression. Using classical results from geometric singular perturbation theory, we provide a detailed proof that if the effect of the mutation on phenotypic expression is small ("weak selection"), the large system of dynamical equations needed to describe selection on the mutant allele in the metacommunity can be reduced to a single ordinary differential equation on the arithmetic mean mutant allele frequency that is of constant sign. This invariance on allele frequency entails the mutant either dies out or will out-compete the ancestral resident (or wild) type. Moreover, the directional selection coefficient driving arithmetic mean allele frequency can be expressed as an inclusive fitness effect calculated from the resident metacommunity alone, and depends, as expected, on individual fitness differentials, relatedness, and reproductive values. This formalizes the Darwinian process of gradual evolution driven by random mutation and natural selection in spatially and physiologically class-structured metacommunities. (C) 2021 The Author( s).

AB  - During a range expansion, deleterious mutations can "surf'' on the colonization front. The resultant decrease in fitness is known as expansion load. An Allee effect is known to reduce the loss of genetic diversity of expanding populations, by changing the nature of the expansion from "pulled"to "pushed". We study the impact of an Allee effect on the formation of an expansion load with a new model, in which individuals have the genetic structure of a Muller's ratchet. A key feature of Muller's ratchet is that the population fatally accumulates deleterious mutations due to the stochastic loss of the fittest individuals, an event called a click of the ratchet. We observe fast clicks of the ratchet at the colonization front owing to small population size, followed by a slow fitness recovery due to migration of fit individuals from the bulk of the population, leading to a transient expansion load. For large population size, we are able to derive quantitative features of the expansion wave, such as the wave speed and the frequency of individuals carrying a given number of mutations. Using simulations, we show that the presence of an Allee effect reduces the rate at which clicks occur at the front, and thus reduces the expansion load. (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Although the Reduction Principle for rates of mutation, migration, and recombination has been proved for large populations under constant selection, the fate of modifiers of these evolutionary forces under frequency-dependent or fluctuating selection is, in general, less well understood. Here we study modifiers of transmission, which include modifiers of mutation and oblique cultural transmission, under frequency-dependent and cyclically fluctuating selection, and develop models for which the Reduction Principle fails. We show that whether increased rates of transmission can evolve from an equilibrium at which there is zero transmission (for example, no mutation) depends on the number of alleles among which transmission is occurring. In addition, properties of the null-transmission state are clarified. (c) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Individuals differ in their life courses, but how this diversity is generated, how it has evolved and how it is maintained is less understood. However, this understanding is crucial to comprehend evolutionary and ecological population dynamics. In structured populations, individual life courses represent sequences of stages that end in death. These life course trajectories or sequences can be described by a Markov chain and individuals diversify over the course of their lives by transitioning through diverse discrete stages. The rate at which stage sequences diversify with age can be quantified by the population entropy of a Markov chain. Here, we derive sensitivities of the population entropy of a Markov chain to identify which stage transitions generate - or contribute - most to diversification in stage sequences, i.e. life courses. We then use these sensitivities to reveal potential selective forces on the dynamics of life courses. To do so we correlated the sensitivity of each matrix element (stage transition) with respect to the population entropy, to its sensitivity with respect to fitness lambda, the population growth rate. Positive correlation between the two sensitivities would suggest that the stage transitions that selection has acted most strongly on (high sensitivities with respect to lambda) are also those that contributed most to the diversification of life courses. Using an illustrative example on a seabird population, the Thick-billed Murres on Coats Island, that is structured by reproductive stages, we show that the most influential stage transitions for diversification of life courses are not correlated with the most influential transitions for population growth. Our finding suggests that observed diversification in life courses is neutral rather than adaptive, note this does not imply that the life histories themselves are not adaptive. We are at an early stage of understanding how individual level dynamics shape ecological and evolutionary dynamics, and many discoveries await. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Selection is commonly described by assigning constant relative fitness values to genotypes. Yet population density is often regulated by crowding. Relative fitness may then depend on density, and selection can change density when it acts on a density-regulating trait. When strong density-dependent selection acts on a density-regulating trait, selection is no longer describable by density-independent relative fitnesses, even in demographically stable populations. These conditions are met in most previous models of density-dependent selection (e.g. "K-selection" in the logistic and Lotka-Volterra models), suggesting that density-independent relative fitnesses must be replaced with more ecologically explicit absolute fitnesses unless selection is weak. Here we show that density-independent relative fitnesses can also accurately describe strong density-dependent selection under some conditions. We develop a novel model of density-regulated population growth with three ecologically intuitive traits: fecundity, mortality, and competitive ability. Our model, unlike the logistic or Lotka-Volterra, incorporates a density-dependent juvenile "reproductive excess", which largely decouples density-dependent selection from the regulation of density. We find that density-independent relative fitnesses accurately describe strong selection acting on any one trait, even fecundity, which is both density-regulating and subject to density-dependent selection. Pleiotropic interactions between these traits recover the familiar K-selection behavior. In such cases, or when the population is maintained far from demographic equilibrium, our model offers a possible alternative to relative fitness. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Generalized reciprocity has been proposed as a mechanism for enabling continued cooperation between unrelated individuals. It can be described by the simple rule "help somebody if you received help from someone", and as it does not require individual recognition, complex cognition or extended memory capacities, it has the potential to explain cooperation in a large number of organisms. In a panmictic population this mechanism is vulnerable to defection by individuals who readily accept help but do not help themselves. Here, I investigate to what extent the limitation of social interactions to a social neighborhood can lead to conditions that favor generalized reciprocity in the absence of population structuring. It can be shown that cooperation is likely to evolve if one assumes certain sparse interaction graphs, if strategies are discrete, and if spontaneous helping and reciprocating are independently inherited.

AB  - In genealogies of genes sampled from structured populations, lineages coalesce at rates dependent on the states of the lineages. For migration and coalescence events occurring on comparable time scales, for example, only lineages residing in the same deme of a geographically subdivided population can have descended from a common ancestor in the immediately preceding generation. Here, we explore aspects of genealogical structure in a population comprising two demes, between which migration may occur. We use generating functions to obtain exact densities and moments of coalescence time, number of mutations, total tree length, and age of the most recent common ancestor of the sample. We describe qualitative features of the distribution of gene genealogies, including factors that influence the geographical location of the most recent common ancestor and departures of the distribution of internode lengths from exponential.

AB  - derive a partial differential equation (PDE) that models the age-specific prevalence of a disease as a function of the incidence, remission and mortality rates. The main focus is on non-communicable diseases (NCDs), although the PDE is not restricted to NCDs. As an application of the PDE, the number of persons with dementia in Germany until the year 2050 is estimated based on German incidence data and official population projections. Uncertainty is treated by different scenarios about life expectancy, number of migrants, prevalence of the disease in migrants, and scenarios about the future incidence, and mortality of demented persons. Life expectancy and incidence of dementia have the strongest impact on the future number of persons with dementia. In nearly all scenarios, our estimated case numbers exceed former estimates. Furthermore, we use an example to show that the PDE method yields more accurate results than a common alternative approach. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this paper, with the methods of adaptive dynamics and critical function analysis, we investigate the evolutionary branching phenomenon of predator species. We assume that both the prey and predators are density-dependent and the predator's attack ability can adaptively evolve, but this has a cost in terms of its death rate. First, we identify the general properties of trade-off relationships that allow for a continuously stable strategy and evolutionary branching in the predator strategy. It is found that if the trade-off curve is weakly concave near the singular strategy, then the singular strategy may be an evolutionary branching point. Second, we find that after the branching has occurred in the predator strategy, if the trade-off curve is convex-concave-convex, the predator species will eventually evolve into two different types, which can stably coexist on the much longer evolutionary timescale and no further branching is possible.

AB  - We derive the frequency-dependent selection coefficient caused by "demographic" stochasticity resulting from the random sampling of opponents an individual faces during behavioral "contests" with other individuals. The mean, variance, and higher moments of fitness all influence the direction and strength of selection. A frequency-dependent trait can be stable when an individual's fitness depends upon an infinite number of contests with other individuals and unstable when it depends upon a finite number of contests. Conversely, unstable equilibria for an infinite number of contests can be stable when there is a finite number of contests. At stable equilibria for a finite number of contests, higher moments of fitness can outweigh the joint influence of the first two moments so that natural selection favors "within-generation" or developmental-trait variation (also known as phenotypic plasticity) contrary to the claim that natural selection always acts against such variation. We use second-moment estimates of the fitness functions in a diffusion approximation to compute fixation probabilities of competing strategies. These estimates are shown to be qualitatively consistent with those derived from simulations when population sizes are sufficiently large to ignore the contribution of higher-moment terms. We also show that explicit solutions to the diffusion approximation only exist for pair-wise interactions that lead to positive frequency-dependent selection. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - In some vertebrates, offspring help their parents produce additional offspring. Often individuals of one sex are more likely to become "helpers at the nest". We analyze how such sex-biased offspring helping can influence sex-ratio evolution. It is essential to account for age-structure because the sex ratios of early broods influence how much help is available for later broods; previous authors have not correctly accounted for this fact. When each female produces the same sex ratio in all broods (as assumed in all previous analyses of sex-biased helping), the optimal investment strategy is biased towards the more-helpful sex. When a female has facultative control over the sex ratio in each brood and each helper of a given sex increases the resource available for offspring production by a fixed amount, the optimal strategy is to produce only the more-helpful sex in early broods and only the less-helpful sex in later broods. When there are nonlinear returns from helping, i.e., each helper increases the amount of resource available for reproduction by an amount dependent upon the number of helpers, the optimal strategy is to maximize resource accrual from helping in early broods (which may involve the production of both sexes) and then switch to the exclusive production of the less-helpful sex in later broods. The population sex ratio is biased towards the more-helpful sex regardless of whether the sex ratio is fixed or age-dependent. When fitness returns from helping exhibit environmental patchiness, females are selected to produce only males on some patches and only females on others, and the population sex ratio may be biased in either direction. We discuss our results in light of empirical information on offspring helping, and we show via meta-analysis that there is no support for the claim of Griffin et al. [Griffin, AS., Sheldon, B.C., West, S.A., 2005. Cooperative breeders adjust offspring sex ratios to produce helpful helpers. Amer. Nat. 166,628-632] that parents produce more of the helpful sex when that sex is rare or absent. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Motivation: A main challenge in molecular evolution is to find computationally efficient mutation models with flexible assumptions that properly reflect genetic variation. The infinite sites model assumes that each mutation event occurs at a site never previously mutant, i.e. it does not allow recurrent mutations. This is reasonable for low mutation rates and makes statistical inference much more tractable. However, recurrent mutations are common enough to be observable from genetic variation data, even in species with low per-site mutation rates such as humans. The finite sites model on the other hand allows for recurrent mutations but is computationally unfeasible to work with in most cases. In this work, we bridge these two approaches by developing a novel molecular evolution model, the almost infinite sites model, that both admits recurrent mutations and is tractable. We provide a recursive characterization of the likelihood of our proposed model under complete linkage and outline a parsimonious approximation scheme for computing it. Results: We show the usefulness of our model in simulated and human mitochondrial data. Our results show that the AISM, in combination with a constraint on the total number of mutation events, can recover accurate approximations to the maximum likelihood estimator of the mutation rate. Availability and implementation: An implementation of our model is freely available along with code for reproducing our computational experiments at https://github.com/Cronjaeger/almost-infinite-sites-recursions.

AB  - This work presents a population genetic model of evolution, which includes haploid selection, mutation, recombination, and drift. The mutation-selection equilibrium can be expressed exactly in closed form for arbitrary fitness functions without resorting to diffusion approximations. Tractability is achieved by generating new offspring using n-parent rather than 2-parent recombination. While this enforces linkage equilibrium among offspring, it allows analysis of the whole population under linkage disequilibrium. We derive a general and exact relationship between fitness fluctuations and response to selection. Our assumptions allow analytical calculation of the stationary distribution of the model for a variety of non-trivial fitness functions. These results allow us to speak to genetic architecture, i.e., what stationary distributions result from different fitness functions. This paper presents methods for exactly deriving stationary states for finite and infinite populations. This method can be applied to many fitness functions, and we give exact calculations for four of these. These results allow us to investigate metastability, tradeoffs between fitness functions, and even consider error-correcting codes. & COPY; 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Coevolutionary negative frequency-dependent selection has been hypothesized to maintain genetic variation in host and parasites. Despite the extensive literature pertaining to host-parasite coevolution, the temporal dynamics of genetic variation have not been examined in a matching-alleles model (MAM) with a finite population size relative to the expectation under neutral genetic drift alone. The dynamics of the MA coevolution in an infinite population, in fact, suggests that genetic variation in these coevolving populations behaves neutrally. By comparing host heterozygosity to the expectation in a single-species model of neutral genetic drift we find that while this is also largely true in finite populations two additional phenomena arise. First, reciprocal natural selection acting on stochastic perturbations in host and pathogen allele frequencies results in a slight increase or decrease in genetic variation depending on the parameter conditions. Second, following the fixation of an allele in the parasite, selection in the MAM becomes directional, which then rapidly erodes genetic variation in the host. Hence, rather than maintain it, we find that, on average, matching-alleles coevolution depletes genetic variation. (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Such an assumption works well for facultative cooperators (e.g. flocking birds, schooling fish, and swarming locusts) but less so for obligate co-operators (e.g. canids, cetaceans, and primates). With obligate co-operators, the fitness consequences from associations are stronger compared to facultative co-operators. Consequently, individuals within a group should be more discerning and selective over their associations, rejecting new members and even removing current members. Incorporating such aspects into population models may better reflect obligately cooperative species. In this paper, we create and analyze a model of the population dynamics of obligate co-operators. In our model, a behavioral game determines within-group population dynamics that then spill over into between-group dynamics. Our analysis shows that group number increases when population dynamics are stable, but additional groups lead to unstable population dynamics and an eventual collapse of group numbers. Using a more general analysis, we identify a fundamental mismatch between the stability of the behavioral dynamics and the stability of the population dynamics. When one is stable, the other is not. Our results suggest that group turnover may be inherent to the population dynamics of obligate co-operators. The instability arises from a non-chaotic deterministic process, and such dynamics should be predictable and testable. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Cultural processes, as well as the selection pressures experienced by individuals in a population over time and space, are fundamentally stochastic. Phenotypic variability, together with imperfect phenotypic transmission between parents and offspring, has been previously shown to play an important role in evolutionary rescue and (epi)genetic adaptation of populations to fluctuating temporal environmental pressures. This type of evolutionary bet-hedging does not confer a direct benefit to a single individual, but can instead increase the adaptability of the whole lineage.
   Here we develop a population-genetic model to explore cultural response strategies to temporally changing selection, as well as the role of local population structure, as exemplified by heterogeneity in the contact network between individuals, in shaping evolutionary dynamics. We use this model to study the evolutionary advantage of cultural bet-hedging, modeling the evolution of a variable cultural trait starting from one copy in a population of individuals with a fixed cultural strategy. We find that the probability of fixation of a cultural bet-hedger is a non-monotonic function of the probability of cultural memory between generations. Moreover, this probability increases for networks of higher mean degree but decreases with increasing heterogeneity of the contact network, tilting the balance of forces toward drift and against selection.
   These results shed light on the interplay of temporal and spatial stochasticity in shaping cultural evolutionary dynamics and suggest that partly-heritable cultural phenotypic variability may constitute an important evolutionary bet-hedging strategy in response to changing selection pressures.

AB  - Inference with population genetic data usually treats the population pedigree as a nuisance parameter, the unobserved product of a past history of random mating. However, the history of genetic relationships in a given population is a fixed, unobserved object, and so an alternative approach is to treat this network of relationships as a complex object we wish to learn about, by observing how genomes have been noisily passed down through it. This paper explores this point of view, showing how to translate questions about population genetic data into calculations with a Poisson process of mutations on all ancestral genomes. This method is applied to give a robust interpretation to the f(4) statistic used to identify admixture, and to design a new statistic that measures covariances in mean times to most recent common ancestor between two pairs of sequences. The method more generally interprets population genetic statistics in terms of sums of specific functions over ancestral genomes, thereby providing concrete, broadly interpretable interpretations for these statistics. This provides a method for describing demographic history without simplified demographic models. More generally, it brings into focus the population pedigree, which is averaged over in model-based demographic inference. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Recombination in mammals is not uniformly distributed along the chromosome but concentrated in small regions known as recombination hotspots. Recombination starts with the double-strand break of a chromosomal sequence and results in the transmission of the sequence that does not break (preventing recombination) more often than the sequence that breaks (allowing recombination). Thus recombination itself renders individual recombination hotspots inactive and over time should drive them to extinction in the genome. Empirical evidence shows that individual recombination hotspots die but, far from being driven to extinction, they are abundant in the genome: a contradiction referred to as the Recombination Hotspot Paradox. What saves recombination hotspots from extinction? The current answer relies in the formation of new recombination hotspots in new genomic sites driven by viability selection in favor of recombination. Here we formulate a population genetics model that incorporates the molecular mechanism initiating recombination in mammals (PRDM9-like genes), to provide an alternative solution to the paradox. We find that weak selection allows individual recombination hotspots to become inactive (die) while saving them from extinction in the genome by driving their re-activation (resurrection). Our model shows that when selection for recombination is weak, the introduction of rare variants causes recombination sites to oscillate between hot and cold phenotypes with a recombination hotspot dying only to come back. Counter-intuitively, we find that low viability selection leaves a hard selective sweep signature in the genome, with the selective sweep at the recombination hotspot being the hardest when viability selection is the lowest. Our model can help to understand the rapid evolution of PRDM9, the co-existence of two types of hotspots, the life expectancy of hotspots, and the volatility of the recombinational landscape (with hotspots rarely being shared between closely related species).

AB  - Motivated by tumor growth and spatial population genetics, we study the interplay between evolutionary and spatial dynamics at the surfaces of three-dimensional, spherical range expansions. We consider range expansion radii that grow with an arbitrary power-law in time: R(t) = R-0(1 + t/t*)(Theta), where Theta is a growth exponent, R-0 is the initial radius, and t* is a characteristic time for the growth, to be affected by the inflating geometry. We vary the parameters t* and Theta to capture a variety of possible growth regimes. Guided by recent results for two-dimensional inflating range expansions, we identify key dimensionless parameters that describe the survival probability of a mutant cell with a small selective advantage arising at the population frontier. Using analytical techniques, we calculate this probability for arbitrary Theta. We compare our results to simulations of linearly inflating expansions (Theta = 1 spherical Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piscunov waves) and treadmilling populations (Theta = 0, with cells in the interior removed by apoptosis or a similar process). We find that mutations at linearly inflating fronts have survival probabilities enhanced by factors of 100 or more relative to mutations at treadmilling population frontiers. We also discuss the special properties of "marginally inflating" (Theta = 1/2) expansions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Organisms may adjust their phenotypes in response to social and physical environments. Such phenotypic plasticity is known to help or retard adaptive evolution. Here, we study the evolutionary outcomes of adaptive phenotypic plasticity in an evolutionary game involving two players who have no conflicts of interest. A possible example is the growth and sex allocation of a lifelong pair of shrimps entrapped in the body of a sponge. We consider random pair forrnation, the limitation of total resources for growth, and the needs of male investment to fertilize eggs laid by the partner. We compare the following three different evolutionary dynamics: (1) No adjustment: each individual develops a phenotype specified by its own genotype; (2) One-player adjustment: the phenotype of the first player is specified by its own genotype, and the second player chooses the phenotype that maximizes its own fitness; (3) Two-player adjustment: the first player exhibits an initial phenotype specified by its own genotype, the second player chooses a phenotype given that of the first player, and finally, the first player readjusts its phenotype given that of the second player. We demonstrate that both one-player and two-player adjustments evolve to achieve maximum fitness. In contrast, the dynamics without adjustment fails in some cases to evolve outcomes with the highest fitness. For an intermediate range of male cost, the evolution of no adjustment realizes two hermaphrodites with equal size, whereas the one-player and two-player adjustments realize a small male and a large female.

AB  - Parasites are either dedicated to a narrow host range, or capable of exploiting a wide host range. Understanding how host ranges are determined is very important for public health, as well as wildlife, plant, livestock and agricultural diseases. Our current understanding of host-parasite associations hinges on co-evolution, which assumes evolved host preferences (host specialization) of the parasite. Despite the explanatory power of this framework, we have only a vague understanding of why many parasites routinely cross the host species' barrier. Here we introduce a simple model demonstrating how superinfection (in a heterogeneous community) can promote host-parasite association. Strikingly, the model illustrates that strong host-parasite association occurs in the absence of host specialization, while still permitting cross-species transmission. For decades, host specialization has been foundational in explaining the maintenance of distinct parasites/strains in host species. We argue that host specializations may be exaggerated, and can occur as a byproduct (not necessarily the cause) of host-parasite associations. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Taylor's law (TL), a widely verified empirical relationship in ecology, states that the variance of population density is approximately a power-law function of mean density. The growth-rate theorem (GR) states that, in a subdivided population, the rate of change of the overall growth rate is proportional to the variance of the subpopulations' growth rates. We show that continuous-time exponential change implies GR at every time and, asymptotically for large time, TL with power-law exponent 2. We also show why diverse population-dynamic models predict TL in the limit of large time by identifying simple features these models share: If the mean population density and the variance of population density are (exactly or asymptotically) non-constant exponential functions of a parameter (e.g., time), then the variance of density is (exactly or asymptotically) a power-law function of mean density.

AB  - We investigate the joint evolution of public goods cooperation and dispersal in a metapopulation model with small local populations. Altruistic cooperation can evolve due to assortment and kin selection, and dispersal can evolve because of demographic stochasticity, catastrophes and kin selection. Metapopulation structures resulting in assortment have been shown to make selection for cooperation possible. But how does dispersal affect cooperation and vice versa, when both are allowed to evolve as continuous traits? We found four qualitatively different evolutionary outcomes. (1) Monomorphic evolution to full defection with positive dispersal. (2) Monomorphic evolution to an evolutionarily stable state with positive cooperation and dispersal. In this case, parameter changes selecting for increased cooperation typically also select for increased dispersal. (3) Evolutionary branching can,result in the evolutionarily stable coexistence of defectors and cooperators. Although defectors could be expected to disperse more than cooperators, here we show that the opposite case is also possible: Defectors tend to disperse less than cooperators when the total amount of cooperation in the dimorphic population is low enough. (4) Selection for too low cooperation can cause the extinction of the evolving population. For moderate catastrophe rates dispersal needs to be initially very frequent for evolutionary suicide to occur. Although selection for less dispersal in principle could prevent such evolutionary suicide, in most cases this rescuing effect is not sufficient, because selection in the cooperation trait is typically much stronger. If the catastrophe rate is large enough, a part of the boundary of viability can be evolutionarily attracting with respect to both strategy components, in which case evolutionary suicide is expected from all initial conditions.

AB  - We study a multi-stage model for the development of colorectal cancer from initially healthy tissue. The model incorporates a complex sequence of driver gene alterations, some of which result in immediate growth advantage, while others have initially neutral effects. We derive analytic estimates for the sizes of premalignant subpopulations, and use these results to compute the waiting times to premalignant and malignant genotypes. This work contributes to the quantitative understanding of colorectal tumor evolution and the lifetime risk of colorectal cancer.(c) 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Gene genealogies are frequently studied by measuring properties such as their height (H), length (L), sum of external branches (E), sum of internal branches (I), and mean of their two basal branches (B), and the coalescence times that contribute to the other genealogical features (T). These tree properties and their relationships can provide insight into the effects of population-genetic processes on genealogies and genetic sequences. Here, under the coalescent model, we study the 15 correlations among pairs of features of genealogical trees: Hn, Ln, En, In, Bn, and Tk for a sample of size n, with 2 < k < n. We report high correlations among Hn, Ln, In, and Bn, with all pairwise correlations of these quantities having values greater than or equal to 6[6 zeta (3) + 6 - pi 2]/(pi 18 + 9 pi 2 - pi 4) R% 0.84930 in the limit as n -> oo, where zeta is the Riemann zeta function. Although En has expectation 2 for all n and Hn has expectation 2 in the n -> oo limit, their limiting correlation is 0. The results contribute toward understanding features of the shapes of coalescent trees. (c) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - When approached by a predator many prey species will emit an "alarm call" as a form of anti-predator behavior. One hypothesis for the function of alarm calls is the "burglar alarm" hypothesis whereby upon attack, a prey renders itself dangerous to a predator by generating an alarm call that attracts a predator at higher trophic levels in the food chain; that is, attracts a predator to the prey's own predator. This paper concerns a model incorporating a mechanism to test the burglar alarm hypothesis. We prove in one space dimension global existence, of positive bounded classical solutions, and establish existence of non-constant equilibrium solutions and assess their stability. We provide some representative numerical simulations to emphasize the nature of pattern formation for this model and demonstrate the benefit achieved by a signal inducing prey species under the burglar alarm hypothesis.

AB  - The reproductive number R (or R-0, the initial reproductive number in an immune-naive population) has long been successfully used to predict the likelihood of pathogen invasion, to gauge the potential severity of an epidemic, and to set policy around interventions. However, often ignored complexities have generated confusion around use of the metric. This is particularly apparent with the emergent pandemic virus SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. We address some misconceptions about the predictive ability of the reproductive number, focusing on how it changes over time, varies over space, and relates to epidemic size by referencing the mathematical definition of R and examples from the current pandemic. We hope that a better appreciation of the uses, nuances, and limitations of R and R-0 facilitates a better understanding of epidemic spread, epidemic severity, and the effects of interventions in the context of SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - In this article, we propose a Wright-Fisher model with two types of individuals: the inefficient individuals, those who need more resources to reproduce and can have a higher growth rate, and the efficient individuals. In this model, the total amount of resource N is fixed, and the population size varies randomly depending on the number of efficient individuals. We show that, as N increases, the frequency process of efficient individuals converges to a diffusion which is a generalization of the Wright-Fisher diffusion with selection. The genealogy of this model is given by a branching- coalescing process that we call the Ancestral Selection/Efficiency Graph, and that is an extension of the Ancestral Selection Graph (Krone and Neuhauser, 1997a,b). The main contribution of this paper is that, in evolving populations, inefficiency can arise as a promoter of selective advantage and not necessarily as a trade-off. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - In contrast with autosomes, lineages of sex chromosomes reside for different amounts of time in males and females, and this transmission asymmetry makes them hotspots for sexual conflict. Similarly, the maternal inheritance of the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) means that mutations that are beneficial in females can spread in a population even if they are deleterious in males, a form of sexual conflict known as Mother's Curse. While both Mother's Curse and sex chromosome induced sexual conflict have been well studied on their own, the interaction between mitochondrial genes and genes on sex chromosomes is poorly understood. Here, we use analytical models and computer simulations to perform a comprehensive examination of how transmission asymmetries of nuclear, mitochondrial, and sex chromosome-linked genes may both cause and resolve sexual conflicts. For example, the accumulation of male-biased Mother's Curse mtDNA mutations will lead to selection in males for compensatory nuclear modifier loci that alleviate the effect. We show how the Y chromosome, being strictly paternally transmitted provides a particularly safe harbor for such modifiers. This analytical framework also allows us to discover a novel kind of sexual conflict, by which Y chromosome-autosome epistasis may result in the spread of male beneficial but female deleterious mutations in a population. We christen this phenomenon Father's Curse. Extending this analytical framework to ZW sex chromosome systems, where males are the heterogametic sex, we also show how W-autosome epistasis can lead to a novel kind of nuclear Mother's Curse. Overall, this study provides a comprehensive framework to understand how genetic transmission asymmetries may both cause and resolve sexual conflicts. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The linkage disequilibrium coefficient r(2) is a measure of statistical dependence of the alleles possessed by an individual at different genetic loci. It is widely used in association studies to search for the locations of disease-causing genes on chromosomes. Most studies to date treat r(2) as a fixed property of two loci in a finite population, and investigate the sampling distribution of estimators due to the statistical sampling of individuals from the population. Here, we instead consider the distribution of r(2) itself under a process of genetic sampling through the generations. Using a classical two-locus model for genetic drift, mutation, and recombination, we investigate the probability density function of r(2) at stationarity. This density function provides a tool for inference on evolutionary parameters such as mutation and recombination rates. We reconstruct the approximate stationary density of r(2) by calculating a finite sequence of the distribution's moments and applying the maximum entropy principle. Our approach is based on the diffusion approximation, under which we demonstrate that for certain models in population genetics, moments of the stationary distribution can be obtained without knowing the probability distribution itself. To illustrate our approach, we show how the stationary probability density of r(2) can be used in a maximum likelihood framework to estimate mutation and recombination rates from sample data of r(2).

AB  - Generation of variation may be detrimental in well-adapted populations evolving under constant selection. In a constant environment, genetic modifiers that reduce the rate at which variation is generated by processes such as mutation and migration, succeed. However, departures from this reduction principle have been demonstrated. Here we analyze a general model of evolution under constant selection where the rate at which variation is generated depends on the individual. We find that if a modifier allele increases the rate at which individuals of below-average fitness generate variation, then it will increase in frequency and increase the population mean fitness. This principle applies to phenomena such as stress-induced mutagenesis and condition-dependent dispersal, and exemplifies "Necessity is the mother of genetic invention." (C) 2018 The Authors.

AB  - Coalescent simulations are a widely used approach for simulating sample genealogies, but can become computationally burdensome in large samples. Methods exist to analytically calculate a sample's expected frequency spectrum without simulating full genealogies. However, statistics that rely on the distribution of the length of internal coalescent branches, such as the probability that two mutations of equal size arose on the same genealogical branch, have previously required full coalescent simulations to estimate. Here, we present a sampling method capable of efficiently generating limited portions of sample genealogies using a series of analytic equations that give probabilities for the number, start, and end of internal branches conditional on the number of final samples they subtend. These equations are independent of the coalescent waiting times and need only be calculated a single time, lending themselves to efficient computation. We compare our method with full coalescent simulations to show the resulting distribution of branch lengths and summary statistics are equivalent, but that for many conditions our method is at least 10 times faster.

AB  - Recent archaeological records no longer support a simple dichotomous characterization of the cultures/behaviors of Neanderthals and modern humans, but indicate much cultural/behavioral variability over time and space. Thus, in modeling the replacement or assimilation of Neanderthals by modern humans, it is of interest to consider cultural dynamics and their relation to demographic change. The ecocultural framework for the competition between hominid species allows their carrying capacities to depend on some measure of the levels of culture they possess. In the present study both population densities and the densities of skilled individuals in Neanderthals and modern humans are spatially distributed and subject to change by spatial diffusion, ecological competition, and cultural transmission within each species. We analyze the resulting range expansions in terms of the demographic, ecological and cultural parameters that determine how the carrying capacities relate to the local densities of skilled individuals in each species. Of special interest is the case of cognitive and intrinsic-demographic equivalence of the two species. The range expansion dynamics may consist of multiple wave fronts of different speeds, each of which originates from a traveling wave solution. Properties of these traveling wave solutions are mathematically derived. Depending on the parameters, these traveling waves can result in replacement of Neanderthals by modern humans, or assimilation of the former by the latter. In both the replacement and assimilation scenarios, the first wave of intrusive modem humans is characterized by a low population density and a low density of skilled individuals, with implications for archaeological visibility. The first invasion is due to weak interspecific competition. A second wave of invasion may be induced by cultural differences between moderns and Neanderthals. Spatially and temporally extended coexistence of the two species, which would have facilitated the transfer of genes from Neanderthal into modern humans and vice versa, is observed in the traveling waves, except when niche overlap between the two species is extremely high. Archaeological findings on the spatial and temporal distributions of the Initial Upper Palaeolithic and the Early Upper Palaeolithic and of the coexistence of Neanderthals and modern humans are discussed.

AB  - We address the evolution of effective number of individuals under androdioecy and gynodioecy. We analyze dynamic models of autosomal modifiers of weak effect on sex expression. In our zygote control models, the sex expressed by a zygote depends on its own genotype, while in our maternal control models, it depends on the genotype of its maternal parent. Our analysis unifies full multi-dimensional local stability analysis with the Li-Price equation, which for all its heuristic appeal, describes evolutionary change over a single generation. We define a point in the neighborhood of a fixation state from which a single-generation step indicates the asymptotic behavior of the frequency of a modifier allele initiated at an arbitrary point near the fixation state. A concept of heritability appropriate for the evolutionary modification of sex emerges from the Li-Price framework. We incorporate our theoretical analysis into our previously-developed Bayesian inference framework to develop a new method for inferring the viability of gonochores (males or females) relative to hermaphrodites. Applying this approach to microsatellite data derived from natural populations of the gynodioecious plant Schiedea salicaria and the androdioecious killifish Kryptolebias marmoratus, we find that while female and hermaphrodite S. salicaria appear to have similar viabilities, male K. marmoratus appear to survive to reproductive age at less than half the rate of hermaphrodites.

AB  - In finite populations, mutation limitation and genetic drift can hinder evolutionary diversification. We consider the evolution of a quantitative trait in an asexual population whose size can vary and depends explicitly on the trait. Previous work showed that evolutionary branching is certain ("deterministic branching") above a threshold population size, but uncertain ("stochastic branching") below it. Using the stationary distribution of the population's trait variance, we identify three qualitatively different sub domains of "stochastic branching" and illustrate our results using a model of social evolution. We find that in very small populations, branching will almost never be observed; in intermediate populations, branching is intermittent, arising and disappearing over time; in larger populations, finally, branching is expected to occur and persist for substantial periods of time. Our study provides a clearer picture of the ecological conditions that facilitate the appearance and persistence of novel evolutionary lineages in the face of genetic drift. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - A new individual-based model is presented for investigating an important group of invasive plant species, from the genus Spartina, that threaten biodiversity in coastal and intertidal habitats around the world. The role of pollen limitation in influencing the early development of an invasion is explored in order to gain a greater understanding of the mechanistic basis for an apparent Allee effect (causal relationship between population size/density and mean individual fitness) observed in populations of invasive Spartina species: The model is used to explore how various factors such as atmospheric stability, wind direction/speed, pollen characteristics and spatial structure of the population affect the overall invasion dynamics and reproductive success. Comparisons were also made between invasive species of Spartina (S. alterniflora, S. anglica) and a non-invasive species (S. foliosa), showing a reduced Allee effect was associated with invasion success. Furthermore, the conclusions drawn here may give insights into some of the fundamental processes affecting the growth and population dynamics of other invasive wind-pollinated plants.

AB  - Conditional sampling distributions (CSDs), sometimes referred to as copying models, underlie numerous practical tools in population genomic analyses. Though an important application that has received much attention is the inference of population structure, the explicit exchange of migrants at specified rates has not hitherto been incorporated into the CSD in a principled framework. Recently, in the case of a single panmictic population, a sequentially Markov CSD has been developed as an accurate, efficient approximation to a principled CSD derived from the diffusion process dual to the coalescent with recombination. In this paper, the sequentially Markov CSD framework is extended to incorporate subdivided population structure, thus providing an efficiently computable CSD that admits a genealogical interpretation related to the structured coalescent with migration and recombination. As a concrete application, it is demonstrated empirically that the CSD developed here can be employed to yield accurate estimation of a wide range of migration rates. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - I compare the evolutionary dynamics of two success-biased social learning strategies, which, by definition, use the success of others to inform one's social learning decisions. The first, "Compare Means", causes a learner to adopt cultural variants with highest mean payoff in her sample. The second, "Imitate the Best", causes a learner to imitate the single most successful individual in her sample. I summarize conditions under which each strategy performs well or poorly, and investigate their evolution via a gene-culture coevolutionary model. Despite the adaptive appeal of these strategies, both encounter conditions under which they systematically perform worse than simply imitating at random. Compare Means performs worst when the optimal cultural variant is usually at high frequency, while Imitate the Best performs worst when suboptimal variants sometimes produce high payoffs. The extent to which it is optimal to use success-biased social learning depends strongly on the payoff distributions and environmental conditions that human social learners face.

AB  - Motivated by the question of the impact of selective advantage in populations with skewed reproduction mechanisms, we study a Moran model with selection. We assume that there are two types of individuals, where the reproductive success of one type is larger than the other. The higher reproductive success may stem from either more frequent reproduction, or from larger numbers of offspring, and is encoded in a measure A for each of the two types. A-reproduction here means that a whole fraction of the population is replaced at a reproductive event. Our approach consists of constructing a A-asymmetric Moran model in which individuals of the two populations compete, rather than considering a Moran model for each population. Provided the measure are ordered stochastically, we can couple them. This allows us to construct the central object of this paper, the A-asymmetric - asymmetric ancestral selection graph, leading to a pathwise duality of the forward in time A-asymmetric Moran model with its ancestral process. We apply the ancestral selection graph in order to obtain scaling limits of the forward and backward processes, and note that the frequency process converges to the solution of an SDE with discontinuous paths. Finally, we derive a Griffiths representation for the generator of the SDE and use it to find a semi-explicit formula for the probability of fixation of the less beneficial of the two types.

AB  - Numerous traits under migration-selection balance are shown to exhibit complex patterns of genetic architecture with large variance in effect sizes. However, the conditions under which such genetic architectures are stable have yet to be investigated, because studying the influence of a large number of small allelic effects on the maintenance of spatial polymorphism is mathematically challenging, due to the high complexity of the systems that arise. In particular, in the most simple case of a haploid population in a two-patch environment, while it is known from population genetics that polymorphism at a single major-effect locus is stable in the symmetric case, there exist no analytical predictions on how this polymorphism holds when a polygenic background also contributes to the trait. Here we propose to answer this question by introducing a new eco-evo methodology that allows us to take into account the combined contributions of a major-effect locus and of a quantitative background resulting from small-effect loci, where inheritance is encoded according to an extension to the infinitesimal model. In a regime of small variance contributed by the quantitative loci, we justify that traits are concentrated around the major alleles, according to a normal distribution, using new convex analysis arguments. This allows a reduction in the complexity of the system using a separation of time scales approach. We predict an undocumented phenomenon of loss of polymorphism at the major-effect locus despite strong selection for local adaptation, because the quantitative background slowly disrupts the rapidly established polymorphism at the major-effect locus, which is confirmed by individual-based simulations. Our study highlights how segregation of a quantitative background can greatly impact the dynamics of major-effect loci by provoking migrational meltdowns. We also provide a comprehensive toolbox designed to describe how to apply our method to more complex population genetic models.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Ancestral state reconstruction is one of the most important tasks in evolutionary biology. Conditions under which we can reliably reconstruct the ancestral state have been studied for both discrete and continuous traits. However, the connection between these results is unclear, and it seems that each model needs different conditions. In this work, we provide a unifying theory on the consistency of ancestral state reconstruction for various types of trait evolution models. Notably, we show that for a sequence of nested trees with bounded heights, the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a consistent ancestral state reconstruction method under discrete models, the Brownian motion model, and the threshold model are equivalent. When tree heights are unbounded, we provide a simple counter-example to show that this equivalence is no longer valid.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Previous analyses have predicted that social learning should not evolve in a predator-prey system. Here we examine whether success-biased social learning, by which social learners copy successful demonstrators, allows social learning by foragers to evolve. We construct a one-predator, two-prey system in which foragers must learn how to feed on depletable prey populations in an environment where foraging information can be difficult to obtain individually. We analyze two models in which social learning is success-biased: in the first, individual learning does not depend on the resource dynamics, and in the second model it depends on the relative frequency of the resource. Unlike previous results, we find that social learning does not cause predators to over-harvest one type of prey over the other. Furthermore, increasing the probability of social learning increases the probability of learning a successful foraging behavior, especially when individually learned information tends to be inaccurate. Whereas social learning does not evolve among individual learners in the first model, the assumption of resource-dependent learning in the second model allows a mutant with an increased probability of social learning to spread through the forager population.

AB  - We study the effect of variability in payoffs on the evolution of cooperation (C) against defection (D) in multi-player games in a finite well-mixed population. We show that an increase in the covariance between any two payoffs to D, or a decrease in the covariance between any two payoffs to C, increases the probability of ultimate fixation of C when represented once, and decreases the corresponding fixation probability for D. This is also the case with an increase in the covariance between any payoff to C and any payoff to D if and only if the sum of the numbers of C-players in the group associated with these payoffs is large enough compared to the group size. In classical social dilemmas with random cost and benefit for cooperation, the evolution of C is more likely to occur if the variances of the cost and benefit, as well as the group size, are small, while the covariance between cost and benefit is large.(C) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Classical theory in population genetics includes derivation of the stationary distribution of allele frequencies under balance between selection, genetic drift, and mutation. Here we investigate the simplest generalization of these single locus models to quantitative genetics with many loci, assuming simple additive effects on a set of phenotypes and a linear approximation to the fitness function. Genetic effects and pleiotropy are simulated by a prescribed stochastic model. Our goal is to analyze the structure of the G-matrix at stasis when the model is not very close to being neutral. The smallest eigenvalue of the G-matrix is practically zero by Fisher's fundamental theorem for natural selection and the fitness function is approximately a linear function of the corresponding eigenvector. Evolution of genetic trade-offs is closely linked to the fitness function. If a single locus never codes for more than two traits, then additive genetic covariance between two phenotype components always has the opposite sign of the product of their coefficients in the fitness function under no mutation, a pattern that is likely to occur frequently also in more complex models. In our major examples only 1-2 percent of the loci are over-dominant for fitness, but they still account for practically all dominance variance in fitness as well as all contributions to the G-matrix. These analyses show that the structure of the G-matrix reveals important information about the contribution of different traits to fitness. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Non-random mating has a significant impact on the evolution of organisms. Here, I developed a modelling framework for discrete traits (with any number of phenotypes) to explore different models connecting the non-random mating causes (mate competition and/or mate choice) and their consequences (sexual selection and/or assortative mating).
   I derived the formulae for the maximum likelihood estimates of each model and used information criteria to perform multi-model inference. Simulation results showed a good performance of both model selection and parameter estimation. The methodology was applied to ecotypes data of the marine gastropod Littorina saxatilis from Galicia (Spain), to show that the mating pattern is better described by models with two parameters that involve both mate choice and competition, generating positive assortative mating plus female sexual selection. As far as I know, this is the first standardized methodology for model selection and multi-model inference of mating parameters for discrete traits. The advantages of this framework include the ability of setting up models from which the parameters connect causes, as mate competition and mate choice, with their outcome in the form of data patterns of sexual selection and assortative mating. For some models, the parameters may have a double effect i.e. they produce sexual selection and assortative mating, while for others there are separated parameters for one kind of pattern or another. From an empirical point of view, it is much easier to study patterns than processes and, for this reason, the causal mechanisms of sexual selection are not so well known as the patterns they produce. The goal of the present work is to propose a new tool that helps to distinguish among different alternative processes behind the observed mating pattern. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - If viruses or other pathogens infect a single host, the outcome of infection often hinges on the fate of the initial invaders. The initial basic reproduction number R-0, the expected number of cells infected by a single infected cell, helps determine whether the initial viruses can establish a successful beachhead. To determine R-0, the Kingman coalescent or continuous-time birth-and-death process can be used to infer the rate of exponential growth in an historical population. Given M sequences sampled in the present, the two models can make the inference from the site frequency spectrum (SFS), the count of mutations that appear in exactly k sequences (k = 1, 2, ... , M). In the case of viruses, however, if R-0 is large and an infected cell bursts while propagating virus, the two models are suspect, because they are Markovian with only binary branching. Accordingly, this article develops an approximation for the SFS of a discrete-time branching process with synchronous generations (i.e., a Galton-Watson process). When evaluated in simulations with an asynchronous, non-Markovian model (a Bellman-Harris process) with parameters intended to mimic the bursting viral reproduction of HIV, the approximation proved superior to approximations derived from the Kingman coalescent or continuous-time birth-and-death process. This article demonstrates that in analogy to methods in human genetics, the SFS of viral sequences sampled well after latent infection can remain informative about the initial R-0. Thus, it suggests the utility of analyzing the SFS of sequences derived from patient and animal trials of viral therapies, because in some cases, the initial R-0 may be able to indicate subtle therapeutic progress, even in the absence of statistically significant differences in the infection of treatment and control groups.

AB  - We propose a numerical approach to study the invasion fitness of a mutant and to determine evolutionary singular strategies in evolutionary structured models in which the competitive exclusion principle holds. Our approach is based on a dual representation, which consists of the modeling of the small size mutant population by a stochastic model and the computation of its corresponding deterministic model. The use of the deterministic model greatly facilitates the numerical determination of the feasibility of invasion as well as the convergence-stability of the evolutionary singular strategy. Our approach combines standard adaptive dynamics with the link between the mutant survival criterion in the stochastic model and the sign of the eigenvalue in the corresponding deterministic model. We present our method in the context of a mass-structured individual-based chemostat model. We exploit a previously derived mathematical relationship between stochastic and deterministic representations of the mutant population in the chemostat model to derive a general numerical method for analyzing the invasion fitness in the stochastic models. Our method can be applied to the broad class of evolutionary models for which a link between the stochastic and deterministic invasion fitnesses can be established. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - One way to explore assembly of extant and novel communities from species pools, and by that biodiversity and species ranges, is to study the equilibrium behavior of dynamic competition models such as the Lotka-Volterra competition (LVC) model. We present a novel method (COMMUSTIX) to determine all stable fixpoints of the general LVC model with abundances x from a given pool of n species. To that purpose, we split the species in potentially surviving species (x(i) > 0) and in others going extinct (x(i) = 0). We derived criteria for the stability of x(i) = 0 and for the equilibrium of x(i) > 0 to determine possible combinations of extinct and surviving species by iteratively applying a mixed binary linear optimization algorithm.
   We tested this new method against (a) the numerical solution at equilibrium of the LVC ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and (b) the fixpoints of all combinations of surviving and extinct species (possible only for small n), tested for stability and non-negativity. The tests revealed that COMMUSTIX is reliable, it detects all multiple stable fixpoints (SFPs), which is not guaranteed by solving the ODEs, and more efficient than the combinations method.
   With COMMUSTIX, we studied the dependence of the fixpoint behavior on the competition strengths relative to the intra-specific competition. If inter-specific competition was considerably lower than intra-specific competition, only globally SFPs occurred. In contrast, if all inter-specific was higher than intra-specific competition, multiple SFPs consisting of only one species occurred. If competition strengths in the species pool ranged from below to above the intra-specific competition, either global or multiple SFPs strongly differing in species composition occurred. The species richness over all SFPs was high for pools of species with similar, either weak or strong competition, and lower for species with dissimilar or close to intra-specific competition strengths.
   The new approach is a reliable and efficient tool for further extensive examinations of the dependence of community compositions on parameter settings of the LVC model. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - In an SIRS compartment model for a disease we consider the effect of different probability distributions for remaining immune. We show that to first approximation the first three moments of the corresponding probability densities are sufficient to well describe oscillatory solutions corresponding to recurrent epidemics. Specifically, increasing the fraction who lose immunity, increasing the mean immunity time, and decreasing the heterogeneity of the population all favor the onset of epidemics and increase their severity. We consider six different distributions, some symmetric about their mean and some asymmetric, and show that by tuning their parameters such that they have equivalent moments that they all exhibit equivalent dynamical behavior.

AB  - Fisher developed his geometric model to support the micro-mutationalism hypothesis which claims that small mutations are more likely to be beneficial and therefore to contribute to evolution and adaptation. While others have provided a general solution to the model using geometric approaches, we derive an equivalent general solution using a probabilistic approach. Our approach to Fisher's geometric model provides alternative intuition and interpretation of the solution in terms of the model's parameters: for mutation to improve a phenotype, its relative beneficial effect must be larger than the ratio of its total effect and twice the difference between the current phenotype and the optimal one. Our approach provides new insight into this classical model of adaptive evolution. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Transposable elements are DNA segments capable of persisting in host genomes by self-replication in spite of deleterious mutagenic effects. The theoretical dynamics of these elements within genomes has been studied extensively, and population genetic models predict that they can invade and maintain as a result of both intra-genomic and inter-individual selection in sexual species. In asexuals, the success of selfish DNA is more difficult to explain. However, most theoretical work assumes constant environment. Here, we analyze the impact of environmental change on the dynamics of transposition activity when horizontal DNA exchange is absent, based on a stochastic computational model of transposable element proliferation. We argue that repeated changes in the phenotypic optimum in a multidimensional fitness landscape may induce explosive bursts of transposition activity associated with faster adaptation. However, long-term maintenance of transposition activity is unlikely. This could contribute to the significant variation in the transposable element copy number among closely related species.

AB  - Mutualism between plants and animals, such as in pollination and seed dispersal, is a fundamental mechanism facilitating the productivity and biodiversity of ecosystems, and it is often considered as an analog of a free-market economy. The coevolution of plant reward and animal choosiness, however, involves an apparent paradox due to incomplete information and limited mutation rates: plant rewards evolve only when animals are choosy, but choosy animals purge the heritable variations of plants, which then favors less choosy animals. Here we use a two-species mathematical model to illustrate how non-heritable phenotypic variances of plants may facilitate the coevolution of rewards and choosiness and solve the paradox with low mutation rates. We simultaneously track the ecological and evolutionary dynamics and show that the population ratio links the two processes and tunes the stable ecoevolutionary equilibrium. Numerical simulations confirm the analytic prediction with varying mutation rates (heritable variance). The efficiency of a biological market is generally suboptimal due to the information constraint and individual competition. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - We consider a single genetic locus with two alleles A 1 and A 2 in a large haploid population. The locus is subject to selection and two-way, or recurrent, mutation. Assuming the allele frequencies follow a Wright- Fisher diffusion and have reached stationarity, we describe the asymptotic behaviors of the conditional gene genealogy and the latent mutations of a sample with known allele counts, when the count n 1 of allele A 1 is fixed, and when either or both the sample size n and the selection strength |a | tend to infinity. Our study extends previous work under neutrality to the case of non -neutral rare alleles, asserting that when selection is not too strong relative to the sample size, even if it is strongly positive or strongly negative in the usual sense (a -* -infinity or a -* +infinity ), the number of latent mutations of the n 1 copies of allele A 1 follows the same distribution as the number of alleles in the Ewens sampling formula. On the other hand, very strong positive selection relative to the sample size leads to neutral gene genealogies with a single ancient latent mutation. We also demonstrate robustness of our asymptotic results against changing population sizes, when one of |a | or n is large.

AB  - Many species that are birthed in one location and become reproductive in another location can be treated as if in a one-dimensional habitat where dispersal is biased downstream. One example of such is planktonic larvae that disperse in coastal oceans, rivers, and streams. In these habitats, the dynamics of the dispersal are dominated by the movement of offspring in one direction and the distance between parents and offspring in the other direction does not matter. We study an idealized species with non-overlapping generations in a finite linear habitat that has no larval input from outside of the habitat and is therefore isolated from other populations. The most non-realistic assumption that we make is that there are non-overlapping generations, and this is an assumption to be considered in future work. We find that a biased dispersal in the habitat reduces the average time to the most recent common ancestor and causes the average location of the most recent common ancestor to move from the center of the habitat to the upstream edge of the habitat. Due to the decrease in the time to the most recent common ancestor and the shift of the average location to the upstream edge, the effective population size (Ne) no longer depends on the census size and is dependent on the dispersal statistics. We determine the average time and location of the most recent common ancestor as a function of the larval dispersal statistics. The location of the most recent common ancestor becomes independent of the length of the habitat and is only dependent on the location of the upstream edge and the larval dispersal statistics.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - We study local adaptation of a peripheral population by investigating the fate of new mutations using a haploid two-locus two-allele continent-island migration model. We explore how linkage, epistasis, and maladaptive gene flow affect the invasion probability of weakly beneficial de-novo mutations that arise on the island at an arbitrary physical distance to a locus that already maintains a stable migration-selection polymorphism. By assuming a slightly supercritical branching process, we deduce explicit conditions on the parameters that permit a positive invasion probability and we derive approximations for it. They show how the invasion probability depends on the additive and epistatic effects of the mutant, on its linkage to the polymorphism, and on the migration rate. We use these approximations together with empirically motivated distributions of epistatic effects to analyze the influence of epistasis on the expected invasion probability if mutants are drawn randomly from such a distribution and occur at a random physical distance to the existing polymorphism. We find that the invasion probability generally increases as the epistasis parameter increases or the migration rate decreases, but not necessarily as the recombination rate decreases. Finally, we shed light on the size of emerging genomic islands of divergence by exploring the size of the chromosomal neighborhood of the already established polymorphism in which 50% or 90% of the successfully invading mutations become established. These 'window sizes' always decrease in a reverse sigmoidal way with stronger migration and typically increase with increasing epistatic effect. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The patriarchal tradition of surnaming a child after its father in Han Chinese families may contribute to their preference for sons, a major cause of the abnormally high SRB (sex ratio at birth) in China. This high SRB can subsequently contribute to the marriage squeeze on males of marriageable age. Encouraging matrilineal surnaming has been proposed as a strategy that could potentially reduce son preference and help to adjust the imbalance in SRB. Here, we model factors that are likely to influence surnaming decisions, including cultural transmission of parents' surnaming decisions, the cultural value of a daughter, reward given to matrilineal surnaming, and awareness of current imbalance in SRB. Mathematical and computational analyses suggest that offering a significant reward and raising public awareness of the problems inherent in an excess of marriage-age males may overcome the son preference and reduce the male-biased SRB.

AB  - Many species have a dormant stage in their life cycle, including seeds for plants. The dormancy stage influences the species dynamics but is often undetectable. One way to include dormancy is to model it as a hidden dynamical state within a Markovian framework. Models within this framework have already been proposed but with different limitations: only presence/absence observations are modelled, the dormancy stage is limited to one year, or colonisation from neighbouring patches is not taken into account. We propose a hidden Markov model that describes the local and regional dynamics of a species that can undergo dormancy with a potentially infinite dormancy time. Populations are modelled with abundance classes. Our model considers the colonisation process as the indistinguishable influence of neighbour non-dormant population states on a dormant population state in a patch. It would be expected that parameter estimation, hidden state estimation and prediction of the next non-dormant populations would have an exponential computational time in terms of the number of patches. However, we demonstrate that estimation, hidden state estimation and prediction are all achievable in a linear computational time. Numerical experiments on simulated data show that the state of dormant populations can easily be retrieved, as well as the state of future non-dormant populations. Our framework provides a simple and efficient tool that could be further used to analyse and compare annual plants dynamics like weed species survival strategies in crop fields.

AB  - Recovery of population size history from molecular sequence data is an important problem in population genetics. Inference commonly relies on a coalescent model linking the population size history to genealogies. The high computational cost of estimating parameters from these models usually compels researchers to select a subset of the available data or to rely on insufficient summary statistics for statistical inference. We consider the problem of recovering the true population size history from two possible alternatives on the basis of coalescent time data previously considered by Kim et al. (2015). We improve upon previous results by giving exact expressions for the probability of correctly distinguishing between the two hypotheses as a function of the separation between the alternative size histories, the number of individuals, loci, and the sampling times. In more complicated settings we estimate the exact probability of correct recovery by Monte Carlo simulation. Our results give considerably more pessimistic inferential limits than those previously reported. We also extended our analyses to pairwise SMC and SMC' models of recombination. This work is relevant for optimal design when the inference goal is to test scientific hypotheses about population size trajectories in coalescent models with and without recombination.

AB  - The first terms of the Wright-Fisher (WF) site frequency spectrum that follow the coalescent approximation are determined precisely, with a view to understanding the accuracy of the coalescent approximation for large samples. The perturbing terms show that the probability of a single mutant in the sample (singleton probability) is elevated in WF but the rest of the frequency spectrum is lowered. A part of the perturbation can be attributed to a mismatch in rates of merger between WF and the coalescent. The rest of it can be attributed to the difference in the way WF and the coalescent partition children between parents. In particular, the number of children of a parent is approximately Poisson under WF and approximately geometric under the coalescent. Whereas the mismatch in rates raises the probability of singletons under WF, its offspring distribution being approximately Poisson lowers it. The two effects are of opposite sense everywhere except at the tail of the frequency spectrum. The WF frequency spectrum begins to depart from that of the coalescent only for sample sizes that are comparable to the population size. These conclusions are confirmed by a separate analysis that assumes the sample size n to be equal to the population size N. Partly thanks to the canceling effects, the total variation distance of WF minus coalescent is 0.12/log N for a population sized sample with n = N, which is only 1% for N = 2 x 10(4). The coalescent remains a good approximation for the site frequency spectrum of-large samples. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - We develop a novel importance sampler to compute the full likelihood function of a demographic or structural scenario given the site frequency spectrum (SFS) at a locus free of intra-locus recombination. This sampler, instead of representing the hidden genealogy of a sample of individuals by a labelled binary tree, uses the minimal level of information about such a tree that is needed for the likelihood of the SFS and thus takes advantage of the huge reduction in the size of the state space that needs to be integrated. We assume that the population may have demographically changed and may be non-panmictically structured, as reflected by the branch lengths and the topology of the genealogical tree of the sample, respectively. We also assume that mutations conform to the infinitely-many-sites model. We achieve this by a controlled Markov process that generates 'particles' in the hidden space of SFS histories which are always compatible with the observed SFS.
   To produce the particles, we use Aldous' Beta-splitting model for a one parameter family of prior distributions over genealogical topologies or shapes (including that of the Kingman coalescent) and allow the branch lengths or epoch times to have a parametric family of priors specified by a model of demography (including exponential growth and bottleneck models). Assuming independence across unlinked loci, we can estimate the likelihood of a population scenario based on a large collection of independent SFS by an importance sampling scheme, using the (unconditional) distribution of the genealogies under this scenario when the latter is available. When it is not available, we instead compute the joint likelihood of the tree balance parameter beta assuming that the tree topology follows Aldous' Beta splitting model, and of the demographic scenario determining the distribution of the inter-coalescence times or epoch times in the genealogy of a sample, in order to at least distinguish different equivalence classes of population scenarios leading to different tree balances and epoch times. Simulation studies are conducted to demonstrate the capabilities of the approach with publicly available code. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Today, the CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) region within bacterial and archaeal genomes is known to encode an adaptive immune system. We rely on previous results on the evolution of the CRISPR arrays, which led to the ordered independent loss model, introduced by Kupczok and Bollback (2013). When focusing on the spacers (between the repeats), new elements enter a CRISPR array at rate theta at the leader end of the array, while all spacers present are lost at rate rho along the phylogeny relating the sample. Within this model, we compute the distribution of distances of spacers which are present in all arrays in a sample of size n. We use these results to estimate the loss rate rho from spacer array data for n = 2 and n = 3. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The dynamics of two competing species in a finite size community is one of the most studied problems in population genetics and community ecology. Stochastic fluctuations lead, inevitably, to the extinction of one of the species, but the relevant timescale depends on the underlying dynamics. The persistence time of the community has been calculated both for neutral models, where the only driving force of the system is drift (demographic stochasticity), and for models with strong selection. Following recent analyses that stress the importance of environmental stochasticity in empirical systems, we present here a general theory of the persistence time of a two-species community where drift, environmental variations and time independent selective advantage are all taken into account.

AB  - Chronic diseases are a growing public health problem due to the population aging. Their economic, social and demographic burden will worsen in years to come. Up to now, the method used to provide projections and assess the future disease burden makes a non-homogeneous Markov assumption in an illness-death model. Both age and calendar year have been taken into account in all parameter estimations, but the time spent with the disease was not considered.
   This work develops the method with a semi-Markov assumption to model mortality among the diseased and considering the time spent with the disease. The method is applied to estimate several health indicators for dementia in France in 2030.
   We find that mortality among the individuals with dementia depends on age, calendar year and disease duration, and it is greater for men than for women at all ages. The projections for 2030 suggest a 27% increase of the number of dementia cases.
   The model proposed in this work has flexible assumptions that make it adaptable to provide projections for various diseases. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - In spatio-temporal population dynamic models, the most important concept, in addition to mean and variance of local density fluctuations, is the spatial scale of fluctuations in density expressed by studying the spatial autocovariance function. Analytical formulas for this scale in models with local density regulation, dispersal and spatially autocorrelated noise, are rather simple when based on asymptotic theory giving linear models in the limit as the environmental variance approaches zero. The accuracy of these analytical small noise approximations has, however, not been investigated theoretically. Here, we work out improved approximations for the scale as well the spatial autocorrelation function using non-linear logistic local dynamics and going to the next order of approximation with respect to the environmental variance. Generally, it turns out that the asymptotic results are remarkably accurate under moderate fluctuations in density but may be inaccurate for very large fluctuations. For populations with small dispersal capacity, the main error comes from the fact that the logistic dynamics is non-linear, and this error is partly wiped out as dispersal increases. Proportional harvesting has a large effect on the dynamics in spatial as well as non-spatial models, increasing population fluctuations and their spatial scale. The optimal harvesting rate with respect to expected yield per time unit, however, is only to a small extent affected by the magnitude of population fluctuations unless these are very large, so that asymptotic results are applicable over a large range of population fluctuations.

AB  - Relationship inference in a population is of interest for many areas of research from anthropology to genetics. It is possible to directly infer the relationship between the two individuals in a couple from their genetic data or to indirectly infer it from the genetic data of one of their offspring. For this reason, one can wonder if it is more advantageous to sample couples or single individuals to study relationships of couples in a population. Indeed, sampling two individuals is more informative than sampling one as we are looking at four haplotypes instead of two, but it also doubles the cost of the study and is a more complex sampling scheme.
   To answer this question, we performed simulations of 1000 trios from 10 different relationships using real human haplotypes to have realistic genome-wide genetic data. Then, we compared the genome sharing coefficients and the relationship inference obtained from either a pair of individuals or one of their offspring using both single-point and multi-point approaches.
   We observed that for relationships closer than 1st cousin, pairs of individuals were more informative than one of their offspring for relationship inference, and kinship coefficients obtained from single-point methods gave more accurate or equivalent genome sharing estimations. For more remote relationships, offspring were more informative for relationship inference, and inbreeding coefficients obtained from multi-point methods gave more accurate genome sharing estimations.
   In conclusion, relationship inference on a parental pair or on one of their offspring provides complementary information. When possible, sampling trios should be encouraged as it could allow spanning a wider range of potential relationships. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - In this paper, we present an extended SI model of Hilker et al. (2009). In the presented model the birth rate and the death rate are both modeled as quadratic polynomials. This approach provides ample opportunity for taking into account the major contributors to an Allee effect and effectively captures species' differential susceptibility to the Allee effects. It is shown that, the behaviors (persistence or extinction) of the model solutions are characterized by the two essential threshold parameters lambda(0) and lambda(1) of the transmissibility lambda and a threshold quantity mu* of the disease pathogenicity mu. If lambda < lambda(0), the model is bistable and a disease cannot invade from arbitrarily small introductions into the host population at the carrying capacity, while it persists when lambda > lambda(0) and mu < mu*. When lambda > lambda(1) and mu > mu*, the disease derives the host population to extinction with origin as the only global attractor. For the special cases of the model, verifiable conditions for host population persistence (with or without infected individuals) and host extinction are derived. Interestingly, we show that if the values of the parameters alpha and beta of the extended model are restricted, then the two models are similar. Numerical simulations show how the parameter beta affects the dynamics of the model with respect to the host population persistence and extinction. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The recently developed macroscopic approach to demography describes the age distribution of mothers and the net maternity function for a given human population entirely in terms of five parameters. Tracking of these parameters provides a number of new tools for analyzing populations and predicting their future states. Within the macroscopic approach, the new concept of generalized Lotka stability is presented in this paper, as an extension of a strong version of classic Lotka stability. The two leading parameters of the macroscopic approach, the Malthusian parameter r and the perturbations, are computed from population data and plotted in two-dimensional parameter space. Generalized Lotka stability is then defined in terms of the movement of the (r, s)-vector over time. It may be observed in a number of human populations at specific periods of their history.

AB  - A wide range of stochastic processes that model the growth and decline of populations exhibit a curious dichotomy: with certainty either the population goes extinct or its size tends to infinity. There is an elegant and classical theorem that explains why this dichotomy must hold under certain assumptions concerning the process. In this note, I explore how these assumptions might be relaxed further in order to obtain the same, or a similar conclusion, and obtain both positive and negative results. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - It is well established theoretically that competing species may coexist by having different responses to variation over time in the physical environment. Whereas previous theory has focused mostly on year-to-year environmental variation, we investigate how within-year variation can be the basis of species coexistence. We ask also the important but often neglected question of whether the species differences that allow coexistence are compatible with evolutionary processes. We seek the simplest circumstances that permit coexistence based on within-year environmental variation, and then evaluate the robustness of coexistence in the face of evolutionary forces. Our focus is on coexistence of annual plant species living in arid regions. We first consider environmental variation of a very simple structure where a single pulse of rain occurs, and different species have different patterns of growth activity following the rain pulse. We show that coexistence of two species is possible based on the storage effect coexistence mechanism in this simplest of varying environments. We find an exact expression for the magnitude of the storage effect that allows the functioning of the coexistence mechanism to be analyzed. However, in these simplest of circumstances, coexistence in our models is not evolutionarily stable. Increasing the complexity of the environment to two rain pulses leads to evolutionarily stable species coexistence, and a route to diversity via evolutionary branching. This demonstration of the compatibility of a coexistence mechanism with evolutionary processes is an important step in assessing the likely importance of a mechanism in nature. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - We study an individual based model describing competition in space between two different alleles. Although the model is similar in spirit to classic models of spatial population genetics such as the stepping stone model, here however space is continuous and the total density of competing individuals fluctuates due to demographic stochasticity. By means of analytics and numerical simulations, we study the behavior of fixation probabilities, fixation times, and heterozygosity, in a neutral setting and in cases where the two species can compete or cooperate. By concluding with examples in which individuals are transported by fluid flows, we argue that this model is a natural choice to describe competition in marine environments. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Rabies is one of the oldest viral diseases and it has been present on every continent except Antarctica. Within the U.S. human rabies cases are quite rare. In the eastern USA, raccoons are the main reservoir hosts and pet vaccination serves as an important barrier against human rabies exposure. In this paper, we develop a compartmental model for rabies transmission amongst raccoons and domestic pets. We find the diseasefree equilibria, reproduction numbers for the raccoons and domestic pets. We also determine the vaccination coverage/rates, both for raccoons and pets, needed to achieve the elimination of rabies.

AB  - The standard model of a single population fragmented into two patches connected by migration, was first introduced in the 1970s by Freedman and Waltman, since generating long-term research interest, though its full analysis for arbitrary values of migration rate has only been completed relatively recently. Here, we present a model of two competing species in a two-patch habitat with migrations between patches. We derive equilibrium solutions of this model for three cases of migration rate resulting in isolated, well-mixed and semi-isolated habitats. We evaluate the full range of effects of habitat, life-history and migration parameters on population sizes. Finally, we add harvesting mortality and define conditions under which introduction of a no-harvesting (protected) area may lead to increased maximum sustainable yield. The results have applications in mixed fishery management and the design of wildlife protection zones, including marine protected areas (MPAs). (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Modeling covariance structure based on genetic similarity between pairs of relatives plays an important role in evolutionary, quantitative and statistical genetics. Historically, genetic similarity between individuals has been quantified from pedigrees via the probability that randomly chosen homologous alleles between individuals are identical by descent (IBD). At present, however, many genetic analyses rely on molecular markers, with realized measures of genomic similarity replacing IBD-based expected similarities. Animal and plant breeders, for example, now employ marker-based genomic relationship matrices between individuals in prediction models and in estimation of genome-based heritability coefficients. Phenotypes convey information about genetic similarity as well. For instance, if phenotypic values are at least partially the result of the action of quantitative trait loci, one would expect the former to inform about the latter, as in genome-wide association studies. Statistically, a nontrivial conditional distribution of unknown genetic similarities, given phenotypes, is to be expected. A Bayesian formalism is presented here that applies to whole-genome regression methods where some genetic similarity matrix, e.g., a genomic relationship matrix, can be defined. Our Bayesian approach, based on phenotypes and markers, converts prior (markers only) expected similarity into trait-specific posterior similarity. A simulation illustrates situations under which effective Bayesian learning from phenotypes occurs. Pinus and wheat data sets were used to demonstrate applicability of the concept in practice. The methodology applies to a wide class of Bayesian linear regression models, it extends to the multiple-trait domain, and can also be used to develop phenotype-guided similarity kernels in prediction problems.

AB  - Tick-borne pathogens pose a considerable disease burden in Europe and North America, where increasing numbers of human cases and the emergence of new tick-borne pathogens has renewed interest in resolving the mechanisms underpinning their geographical distribution and abundance. For Borrelia burgdorferi and tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus, transmission of infection from one generation of ticks to another occurs when older nymphal ticks infect younger larval ticks feeding on the same host, either indirectly via systemic infection of the vertebrate host or directly when feeding in close proximity. Here, expressions for the basic reproduction number, R-0, and the related tick type-reproduction number, T, are derived that account for the observation that larval and nymphal ticks tend to aggregate on the same minority of hosts, a tick feeding behaviour known as co-aggregation. The pattern of tick blood meals is represented as a directed, acyclic, bipartite contact network, with individual vertebrate hosts having in-degree, k(in), and out-degree, k(out), that respectively represent cumulative counts of nymphal and larval ticks fed over the lifetime of the host. The in- and out-degree are not independent when co-aggregation occurs such that
   T proportional to < k(in)k(out)>/< k(in)>,
   where <.> indicates expected value. When systemic infection in the vertebrate host is the dominant transmission route R-0(2) = T, whereas when direct transmission between ticks co-feeding on the same host is dominant then R-0 = T and the effect of co-aggregation on R-0 is more pronounced. Simulations of B. burgdorferi and TBE virus transmission on theoretical tick-mouse contact networks revealed that aggregation and co-aggregation have a synergistic effect on R-0 and T, that co-aggregation always increases R-0 and T, and that aggregation only increases R-0 and T when larvae and nymphs also co-aggregate. Co-aggregation has the greatest absolute effect on R-0 and T when the mean larval burden of hosts is high, and the largest relative effect on R-0 for pathogens sustained by co-feeding transmission, e.g. TBE virus in Europe, compared with those predominantly spread by systemic infection, e.g. B. burgdorferi. For both pathogens, though, co-aggregation increases the mean number of ticks infected per infectious tick, T, and so too the likelihood of pathogen persistence. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Fluctuating environmental conditions have consequences for the evolution of life histories because they cause fitness variance. This variance can favor risk-spreading strategies, often known as bet-hedging strategies, in which growth or reproduction is spread over time or space, with some costs, but greater certainty of success. An important example is seed dormancy in annual plants, in which some fraction of seed remains dormant at any given germination opportunity with the potential of germinating later when environmental conditions may differ. Previous theory shows that environmental variation is critical for the evolution of dormancy. However, these studies have focused on temporal variation in reproduction, ignoring the strong observed effects of environmental variation on the germination fraction, a major contributor to fitness variance. We ask what effects germination fluctuations have on selection for dormancy by adding germination fluctuations to existing density-independent (d.i.) and density-dependent (d.d.) models of annual plant dynamics, extending previous analyses by including temporally fluctuating germination. Specifically, we ask how germination variance affects selection on the temporal average germination fraction, here used to define dormancy. When present alone, or when independently varying with other fitness components, germination fluctuations do not affect selection for dormancy in the d.i. model, despite generating fitness variance because this variance contribution is not reduced by higher dormancy. Germination fluctuations have strong effects in the d.d. model, favoring dormancy when present either alone or coupled with variation affecting plant growth. This is because germination variation causes seedling density to vary, which causes variable reproduction through variable intraspecific competition. Dormancy is advantaged under variable reproduction because it creates a more convex relationship between population growth and reproduction leading to benefits from nonlinear averaging. Predictive germination, a positive statistical association between germination and growth, weakens selection for dormancy under strong competition and strengthens it when competition is weak. Our results suggest that variable germination is a potential explanation for high levels of dormancy observed in nature, with implications for life-history theory for fluctuating environments.

AB  - In evolutionary biology, randomness has been perceived as a force that, in and of itself, is capable of inventing: mutation creates new genetic information at random across the genome which leads to phenotypic change, which is then subject to selection. However, in science in general and in computer science in particular, the widespread use of randomness takes a different form. Here, randomization allows for the breaking of pattern, as seen for example in its removal of biases (patterns) by random sampling or random assignment to conditions. Combined with various forms of evaluation, this breaking of pattern becomes an extraordinarily powerful tool, as also seen in many randomized algorithms in computer science. Here we show that this power of randomness is harnessed in nature by sex and recombination. In a finite population, and under the assumption of interactions between genetic variants, sex and recombination allow selection to test how well an allele will perform in a sample of combinations of interacting genetic partners drawn at random from all possible such combinations; consequently, even a small number of tests of genotypes such as takes place in a finite population favors alleles that will most likely perform well in a vast number of yet unrealized genetic combinations. This power of randomization is not manifest in asexual populations. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - In the ocean, propagules with a planktonic stage are typically dispersed some distance downstream of the parent generation, introducing an asymmetry to the dispersal. Ocean-dwelling species have also been shown to exhibit chaotic population dynamics. Therefore, we must better understand chaotic population dynamics under the influence of asymmetrical dispersal. Here, we examine a density-dependent population in a current, where the current has both a mean and stochastic component. In our finite domain, the current moves offspring in the downstream direction. This system displays a rich variety of dynamics from chaotic to steady-state, depending on the mean distance the offspring are moved downstream, the diffusive spread of the offspring, and the domain size. We find that asymmetric dispersal can act as a stabilizing or destabilizing mechanism, depending on the size of the mean dispersal distance relative to the other system parameters. As the strength of the current increases, the system can experience period-halving bifurcation cascades. Thus, we show that stability of chaotic aquatic populations is directly tied to the strength of the ocean current in their environment, and our model predicts increased prevalence of chaos with decreasing dispersal distance. Climate change is likely to alter the dispersal patterns of many species, and so our results have implications for conservation and management of said species. We discuss the management implications, particularly of exploited species. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - A cancer grows from a single cell, thereby constituting a large cell population. In this work, we are interested in how mutations accumulate in a cancer cell population. We provide a theoretical framework of the stochastic process in a cancer cell population and obtain near exact expressions of allele frequency spectrum or AFS (only continuous approximation is involved) from both forward and backward treatments under a simple setting; all cells undergo cell divisions and die at constant rates, b and d, respectively, such that the entire population grows exponentially. This setting means that once a parental cancer cell is established, in the following growth phase, all mutations are assumed to have no effect on b or d (i.e., neutral or passengers). Our theoretical results show that the difference from organismal population genetics is mainly in the coalescent time scale, and the mutation rate is defined per cell division, not per time unit (e.g., generation). Except for these two factors, the basic logic is very similar between organismal and cancer population genetics, indicating that a number of well established theories of organismal population genetics could be translated to cancer population genetics with simple modifications.

AB  - A novel strategy for controlling the spread of arboviral diseases such as dengue, Zika and chikungunya is to transform mosquito populations with virus-suppressing Wolbachia. In general, Wolbachia transinfected into mosquitoes induce fitness costs through lower viability or fecundity. These maternally inherited bacteria also produce a frequency-dependent advantage for infected females by inducing cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI), which kills the embryos produced by uninfected females mated to infected males. These competing effects, a frequency-dependent advantage and frequency-independent costs, produce bistable Wolbachia frequency dynamics. Above a threshold frequency, denoted (p) over cap, CI drives fitness decreasing Wolbachia transinfections through local populations; but below (p) over cap, infection frequencies tend to decline to zero. If (p) over cap is not too high, CI also drives spatial spread once infections become established over sufficiently large areas. We illustrate how simple models provide testable predictions concerning the spatial and temporal dynamics of Wolbachia introductions, focusing on rate of spatial spread, the shape of spreading waves, and the conditions for initiating spread from local introductions. First, we consider the robustness of diffusion-based predictions to incorporating two important features of wMel-Aedes aegypti biology that may be inconsistent with the diffusion approximations, namely fast local dynamics induced by complete CI (i.e., all embryos produced from incompatible crosses die) and long-tailed, non-Gaussian dispersal. With complete CI, our numerical analyses show that long-tailed dispersal changes wave-width predictions only slightly; but it can significantly reduce wave speed relative to the diffusion prediction; it also allows smaller local introductions to initiate spatial spread. Second, we use approximations for (p) over cap and dispersal distances to predict the outcome of 2013 releases of wMel-infected Aedes aegypti in Cairns, Australia, Third, we describe new data from Ae. aegypti populations near Cairns, Australia that demonstrate long-distance dispersal and provide an approximate lower bound on (p) over cap for wMel in northeastern Australia. Finally, we apply our analyses to produce operational guidelines for efficient transformation of vector populations over large areas. We demonstrate that even very slow spatial spread, on the order of 10-20 m/month (as predicted), can produce area-wide population transformation within a few years following initial releases covering about 20-30% of the target area.

AB  - Copy-number variation (CNV) is an important form of DNA structural variation because a certain proportion of genomes in many eukaryotic species can contribute to such variations. Owing to the differences between CNV5 and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in size, mutation rate and maintaining mechanism, it is more realistic to characterize CNV evolution under the finite-allele and finite-site models. Here, we propose a method to test multiple CNVs neutrality under the finite-allele and finite-site models and the assumption of mutation-drift process. The statistical property of the method is evaluated through Monte Carlo simulations under the effects of the sample size, the scaled mutation rates, the number of CNVs, the population demographic change, and selection. Different from Tajima's D test, a bootstrap or a permutation approach is suggested to conduct a neutrality test. Application of this method is illustrated using the diploid CNV genotypes measured in discrete copy numbers in 11 HapMap phase III populations. The results show that the mutation-drift process can explain the variation of genome-wide CNV5 among 1184 individuals (856 CNV5, similar to 0.02 Mb on average in size), irrespective of the historical demographic changes. Patterns from allele-frequency-spectrum analysis also support the hypothesis of neutral CNVs. Our results suggest that most human chromosomal changes in healthy individuals via unbalanced rearrangements of the segments with certain sizes are neutral. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - There has been much recent interest in the prevention and mitigation of epidemics spreading through contact networks of host populations. Here, we investigate how the severity of epidemics, measured by its infection rate, influences the efficiency of well-known vaccination strategies. In order to assess the impact of severity, we simulate the SIR model at different infection rates on various real and model immunized networks. An extensive analysis of our simulation results reveals that immunization algorithms, which efficiently reduce the nodes' average degree, are more effective in the mitigation of weak and slow epidemics, whereas vaccination strategies that fragment networks to small components, are more successful in suppressing severe epidemics.

AB  - We develop a theory of generalist predation showing how alternative prey species are affected by changes in both mean abundance and variability (coefficient of variation) of their predator's primary prey. The theory is motivated by the indirect effects of cyclic rodent populations on ground-breeding birds, and developed through progressive analytic simplifications of an empirically-based model. It applies nonetheless to many other systems where primary prey have fast life-histories and can become superabundant, thus facilitating impact on alternative prey species and generating highly asymmetric interactions. Our results suggest that predator effects on alternative prey should generally decrease with mean primary prey abundance, and increase with primary prey variability (low to high CV) unless predators have strong aggregative responses, in which case these results can be reversed. Approximations of models including predator dynamics (general numerical response with possible delays) confirm these results but further suggest that negative temporal correlation between predator and primary prey is harmful to alternative prey. Finally, we find that measurements of predator numerical responses are crucial to predict - even qualitatively - the response of ecosystems to changes in the dynamics of outbreaking prey species.

AB  - Migrational mortality is introduced into the classical single-locus model for migration and selection. Genotype-independent migration follows selection, which may be soft or hard. For soft selection, the effect of mortality on the backward migration matrix is the same as in the Malecot model; for hard selection, some neutral results still hold, but some do not. For two diallelic demes, mortality can increase or decrease the stringency of the condition for protecting an allele from loss. In the discrete-space, continuous-time limit, mortality increases the diagonal elements of the migration rate matrix and decreases its off-diagonal elements. Were it not for the same result in the Malecot model, it would be surprising that mortality does not alter the general diffusion limit for multiple alleles, arbitrary multidimensional migration, and arbitrary selection.

AB  - Several variations of the Watterson estimator of variability for Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) data have been proposed in the literature. We present a unified framework for generalized Watterson estimators based on Maximum Composite Likelihood, which encompasses most of the existing estimators. We propose this class of unbiased estimators as generalized Watterson estimators for a large class of NGS data, including pools and trios. We also discuss the relation with the estimators proposed in the literature and show that they admit two equivalent but seemingly different forms, deriving a set of combinatorial identities as a byproduct. Finally, we give a detailed treatment of Watterson estimators for single or multiple autopolyploid individuals. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Reconstructing past population size from present day genetic data is a major goal of population genetics. Recent empirical studies infer population size history using coalescent-based models applied to a small number of individuals. Here we provide tight bounds on the amount of exact coalescence time data needed to recover the population size history of a single, panmictic population at a certain level of accuracy. In practice, coalescence times are estimated from sequence data and so our lower bounds should be taken as rather conservative. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - For a subdivided population the consequences of dominance and gene flow for the maintenance of multilocus polymorphism, local adaptation, and differentiation are investigated. The dispersing population inhabits two demes in which selection acts in opposite direction. Fitness is determined additively by two linked diallelic loci with arbitrary intermediate dominance (no over- or underdominance). For weak as well as strong migration, the equilibrium structure is derived. As a special case, a continuous-time continent-island model (CI model) is analyzed, with one-way migration from the continent to the island. For this CI model, the equilibrium and stability configuration is obtained explicitly for weak migration, for strong migration, for independent loci, and for complete linkage. For independent loci, the possible bifurcation patterns are derived as functions of the migration rate. These patterns depend strongly on the degree of dominance. The effects of dominance, linkage, and migration on the amount of linkage disequilibrium (LD) and the degree of local adaptation are explored. Explicit formulas are obtained for D (=x(1)x(4) - x(2)x(3)) and r(2) (the squared correlation in allelic state). They demonstrate that dominant island alleles increase D and decrease r(2). Local adaptation is elevated by dominance of the locally adaptive alleles. The effective migration rate at a linked neutral locus is calculated. If advantageous alleles are dominant, it is decreased only slightly below the actual migration rate. For a quantitative trait that is determined by two additive loci, the influence of dominance on measures of differentiation is studied. Explicit expressions for Q(ST) and two types of Fsr at equilibrium are deduced and their relation is discussed. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Inspired by the use of hybrid cellular automata in modeling cancer, we introduce a generalization of evolutionary games in which cells produce and absorb chemicals, and the chemical concentrations dictate the death rates of cells and their fitnesses. Our long term aim is to understand how the details of the interactions in a system with n species and m chemicals translate into the qualitative behavior of the system. Here, we study two simple 2 x 2 games with two chemicals and revisit the two and three species versions of the one chemical colicin system studied earlier by Durrett and Levin (1997). We find that in the 2 x 2 examples, the behavior of our new spatial model can be predicted from that of the mean field differential equation using ideas of Durrett and Levin (1994). However, in the three species colicin model, the system with diffusion does not have the coexistence which occurs in the lattices model in which sites interact with only their nearest neighbors.

AB  - In natural ecosystems, species can be characterized by the nonlinear density-dependent self-regulation of their growth profile. Species of many taxa show a substantial density-dependent reduction for low population size. Nevertheless, many show the opposite trend; density regulation is minimal for small populations and increases significantly when the population size is near the carrying capacity. The theta-logistic growth equation can portray the intraspecific density regulation in the growth profile, theta being the density regulation parameter. In this study, we examine the role of these different growth profiles on the stability of a competitive ecological community with the help of a mathematical model of competitive species interactions. This manuscript deals with the random matrix theory to understand the stability of the classical theta-logistic models of competitive interactions. Our results suggest that having more species with strong density dependence, which self-regulate at low densities, leads to more stable communities. With this, stability also depends on the complexity of the ecological network. Species network connectance (link density) shows a consistent trend of increasing stability, whereas community size (species richness) shows a context-dependent effect. We also interpret our results from the aspect of two different life history strategies: r and K-selection. Our results show that the stability of a competitive network increases with the fraction of r-selected species in the community. Our result is robust, irrespective of different network architectures.

KW  - SIR models
AB  - Nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPI) are an important tool for countering pandemics such as COVID-19. Some are cheap; others disrupt economic, educational, and social activity. The latter force governments to balance the health benefits of reduced infection and death against broader lockdown-induced societal costs. A literature has developed modeling how to optimally adjust lockdown intensity as an epidemic evolves. This paper extends that literature by augmenting the classic SIR model with additional states and flows capturing decay over time in vaccine -conferred immunity, the possibility that mutations create variants that erode immunity, and that protection against infection erodes faster than protecting against severe illness. As in past models, we find that small changes in parameter values can tip the optimal response between very different solutions, but the extensions considered here create new types of solutions. In some instances, it can be optimal to incur perpetual epidemic waves even if the uncontrolled infection prevalence would settle down to a stable intermediate level.

AB  - A population experiencing habitat loss can avoid extinction by undergoing genetic adaptation-a process known as evolutionary rescue. Here we analytically approximate the probability of evolutionary rescue via a niche-constructing mutation that allows carriers to convert a novel, unfavorable reproductive habitat to a favorable state at a cost to their fecundity. We analyze competition between mutants and non-niche-constructing wild types, who ultimately require the constructed habitats to reproduce. We find that over-exploitation of the constructed habitats by wild types can generate damped oscillations in population size shortly after mutant invasion, thereby decreasing the probability of rescue. Such post-invasion extinction is less probable when construction is infrequent, habitat loss is common, the reproductive environment is large, or the population's carrying capacity is small. Under these conditions, wild types are less likely to encounter the constructed habitats and, consequently, mutants are more likely to fix. These results suggest that, without a mechanism that deters wild type inheritance of the constructed habitats, a population undergoing rescue via niche construction may remain prone to short-timescale extinction despite successful mutant invasion.& COPY; 2023 The Authors.

AB  - The Gini coefficient of the life table is a concentration index that provides information on lifespan variation. Originally proposed by economists to measure income and wealth inequalities, it has been widely used in population studies to investigate variation in ages at death. We focus on the complement of the Gini coefficient, Drewnowski's index, which is a measure of equality. We study its mathematical properties and analyze how changes over time relate to changes in life expectancy. Further, we identify the threshold age below which mortality improvements are translated into decreasing lifespan variation and above which these improvements translate into increasing lifespan inequality. We illustrate our theoretical findings simulating scenarios of mortality improvement in the Gompertz model, and showing an example of application to Swedish life table data. Our experiments demonstrate how Drewnowski's index can serve as an indicator of the shape of mortality patterns. These properties, along with our analytical findings, support studying lifespan variation alongside life expectancy trends in multiple species.(c) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - It is not possible to establish the absence of a population with certainty using imperfect zero-sighting records, but absence can be inferred. In this paper we use Bayesian methods to formulate analytical inferred distributions and statistics. When such formulations are available, they offer a highly efficient and powerful means of analysis. Our purpose is to provide accessible and versatile formulations to support an assessment of population absence for management decisions, using data from a series of regular and targeted surveys with zero-sightings. The stochastic processes considered here are prior population size, growth and imperfect detection, which are combined into a single distribution with sufficient flexibility to accommodate alternative distributions for each of the driving processes. Analytical solutions formulated include the inferred mean and variance for population size or number of infested survey-units, the probability of absence, the probability of a series of negative surveys conditional on presence, and the probability a population is first detected in a given survey, although we also formulate other statistics and provide explicit thresholds designed to support management decisions. Our formulation and results are straightforward to apply and provide insight into the nonlinear interactions and general characteristics of such systems. Although motivated by an assessment of population absence following a pest eradication program, results are also relevant to the status of threatened species, to 'proof-of-freedom' requirements for trade, and for inferring population size when a population is first detected.

AB  - A recent theoretical, deterministic model of the effects of phenotypic robustness on adaptive evolutionary dynamics showed that a certain level of phenotypic robustness (critical robustness) is a required condition for adaptation to occur and to be maintained during evolution in most real organismal systems. We built an individual-based heuristic model to verify the soundness of these theoretical results through computer simulation, testing expectations under a range of scenarios for the relevant parameters of the evolutionary dynamics. These include the mutation probability, the presence of stochastic effects, the introduction of environmental influences and the possibility for some features of the population (like selection coefficients and phenotypic robustness) to change themselves during adaptation. Overall, we found a good match between observed and expected results, even for evolutionary parameter values that violate some of the assumptions of the deterministic model, and that robustness can itself evolve. However, from more than one simulation it appears that very high robustness values, higher than the critical value, can limit or slow-down adaptation. This possible trade-off was not predicted by the deterministic model. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The dynamics of a population exhibiting exponential growth can be modelled as a birth-death process, which naturally captures the stochastic variation in population size over time. In this article, we consider a supercritical birth-death process, started at a random time in the past, and conditioned to have n sampled individuals at the present. The genealogy of individuals sampled at the present time is then described by the reversed reconstructed process (RRP), which traces the ancestry of the sample backwards from the present. We show that a simple, analytic, time rescaling of the RRP provides a straightforward way to derive its inter-event times. The same rescaling characterises other distributions underlying this process, obtained elsewhere in the literature via more cumbersome calculations. We also consider the case of incomplete sampling of the population, in which each leaf of the genealogy is retained with an independent Bernoulli trial with probability psi, and we show that corresponding results for Bernoulli-sampled RRPs can be derived using time rescaling, for any values of the underlying parameters. A central result is the derivation of a scaling limit as psi approaches 0, corresponding to the underlying population growing to infinity, using the time rescaling formalism. We show that in this setting, after a linear time rescaling, the event times are the order statistics of n logistic random variables with mode log(1/psi); moreover, we show that the inter-event times are approximately exponentially distributed.

AB  - A diffusion approximation for a randomized 2 x 2-matrix game in a large finite population is ascertained in the case of random payoffs whose expected values, variances and covariances are of order given by the inverse of the population size N. Applying the approximation to a Randomized Prisoner's Dilemma (RPD) with independent payoffs for cooperation and defection in random pairwise interactions, conditions on the variances of the payoffs for selection to favor the evolution of cooperation, favor more the evolution of cooperation than the evolution of defection, and disfavor the evolution of defection are deduced. All these are obtained from probabilities of ultimate fixation of a single mutant. It is shown that the conditions are lessened with an increase in the variances of the payoffs for defection against cooperation and defection and a decrease in the variances of the payoffs for cooperation against cooperation and defection. A RPD game with independent payoffs whose expected values are additive is studied in detail to support the conclusions. Randomized matrix games with non-independent payoffs, namely the RPD game with additive payoffs for cooperation and defection based on random cost and benefit for cooperation and the repeated RPD game with Tit-for-Tat and Always-Defect as strategies in pairwise interactions with a random number of rounds, are studied under the assumption that the population-scaled expected values, variances and covariances of the payoffs are all of the same small enough order. In the first model, the conditions in favor of the evolution of cooperation hold only if the covariance between the cost and the benefit is large enough, while the analysis of the second model extends the results on the effects of the variances of the payoffs for cooperation and defection found for the one-round RPD game.

AB  - We study the evolution of the population genealogy in the classic neutral Moran Model of finite size n epsilon N and in discrete time. The stochastic transformations that shape a Moran population can be realized directly on its genealogy and give rise to a process on a state space consisting of n-sized binary increasing trees. We derive a number of properties of this process, and show that they are in agreement with existing results on the infinite-population limit of the Moran Model. Most importantly, this process admits time reversal, which makes it possible to simplify the mechanisms determining state changes, and allows for a thorough investigation of the Most Recent Common Ancestor process.

AB  - Individuals with different phenotypes can have widely-varying responses to natural selection, yet many classical approaches to evolutionary dynamics emphasize only how a population's average phenotype increases in fitness over time. However, recent experimental results have produced examples of populations that have multiple fitness peaks, or that experience frequency-dependence that affects the direction and strength of selection on certain individuals. Here, we extend classical fitness gradient formulations of natural selection in order to describe the dynamics of a phenotype distribution in terms of its moments-such as the mean, variance, and skewness. The number of governing equations in our model can be adjusted in order to capture different degrees of detail about the population. We compare our simplified model to direct Wright-Fisher simulations of evolution in several canonical fitness landscapes, and we find that our model provides a low-dimensional description of complex dynamics not typically explained by classical theory, such as cryptic selection forces due to selection on trait ranges, time-variation of the heritability, and nonlinear responses to stabilizing or disruptive selection due to asymmetric trait distributions. In addition to providing a framework for extending general understanding of common qualitative concepts in phenotypic evolution - such as fitness gradients, selection pressures, and heritability - our approach has practical importance for studying evolution in contexts in which genetic analysis is infeasible.

AB  - We introduce the conditional Site Frequency Spectrum (SFS) for a genomic region linked to a focal mutation of known frequency. An exact expression for its expected value is provided for the neutral model without recombination. Its relation with the expected SFS for two sites, 2-SFS, is discussed. These spectra derive from the coalescent approach of Fu (1995) for finite samples, which is reviewed. Remarkably simple expressions are obtained for the linked SFS of a large population, which are also solutions of the multi-allelic Kolmogorov equations. These formulae are the immediate extensions of the well known single site theta/f neutral SFS. Besides the general interest in these spectra, they relate to relevant biological cases, such as structural variants and introgressions. As an application, a recipe to adapt Tajima's D and other SFS-based neutrality tests to a non-recombining region containing a neutral marker is presented. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - This article describes and compares methods for simulating the component counts of random logarithmic combinatorial structures such as permutations and mappings. We exploit the Feller coupling for simulating permutations to provide a very fast method for simulating logarithmic assemblies more generally. For logarithmic multisets and selections, this approach is replaced by an acceptance rejection method based on a particular conditioning relationship that represents the distribution of the combinatorial structure as that of independent random variables conditioned on a weighted sum. We show how to improve its acceptance rate. We illustrate the method by estimating the probability that a random mapping has no repeated component sizes, and establish the asymptotic distribution of the difference between the number of components and the number of distinct component sizes for a very general class of logarithmic structures.

AB  - The trajectory of the frequency of an allele which begins at x at time 0 and is known to have frequency z at time T can be modelled by the bridge process of the Wright-Fisher diffusion. Bridges when x = z = 0 are particularly interesting because they model the trajectory of the frequency of an allele which appears at a time, then is lost by random drift or mutation after a time T. The coalescent genealogy back in time of a population in a neutral Wright-Fisher diffusion process is well understood. In this paper we obtain a new interpretation of the coalescent genealogy of the population in a bridge from a time t is an element of (0, T). In a bridge with allele frequencies of 0 at times 0 and T the coalescence structure is that the population coalesces in two directions from t to 0 and t to T such that there is just one lineage of the allele under consideration at times 0 and T. The genealogy in Wright-Fisher diffusion bridges with selection is more complex than in the neutral model, but still with the property of the population branching and coalescing in two directions from time t is an element of (0, T). The density of the frequency of an allele at time t is expressed in a way that shows coalescence in the two directions. A new algorithm for exact simulation of a neutral Wright-Fisher bridge is derived. This follows from knowing the density of the frequency in a bridge and exact simulation from the Wright-Fisher diffusion. The genealogy of the neutral Wright-Fisher bridge is also modelled by branching Polya urns, extending a representation in a Wright-Fisher diffusion. This is a new very interesting representation that relates Wright-Fisher bridges to classical urn models in a Bayesian setting. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The standard model for the dynamics of a fragmented density-dependent population is built from several local logistic models coupled by migrations. First introduced in the 1970s and used in innumerable articles, this standard model applied to a two-patch situation has never been fully analyzed. Here, we complete this analysis and we delineate the conditions under which fragmentation associated with dispersal is either favorable or unfavorable to total population abundance. We pay special attention to the case of asymmetric dispersal, i.e., the situation in which the dispersal rate from patch 1 to patch 2 is not equal to the dispersal rate from patch 2 to patch 1. We show that this asymmetry can have a crucial quantitative influence on the effect of dispersal. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Understanding the historical events that shaped current genomic diversity has applications in historical, biological, and medical research. However, the amount of historical information that can be inferred from genetic data is finite, which leads to an identifiability problem. For example, different historical processes can lead to identical distribution of allele frequencies. This identifiability issue casts a shadow of uncertainty over the results of any study which uses the frequency spectrum to infer past demography. It has been argued that imposing mild 'reasonableness' constraints on demographic histories can enable unique reconstruction, at least in an idealized setting where the length of the genome is nearly infinite. Here, we discuss this problem for finite sample size and genome length. Using the diffusion approximation, we obtain bounds on likelihood differences between similar demographic histories, and use them to construct pairs of very different reasonable histories that produce almost-identical frequency distributions. The finite-genome problem therefore remains poorly determined even among reasonable histories. Where fits to few-parameter models produce narrow parameter confidence intervals, large uncertainties lurk hidden by model assumption. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The exponents of inter-specific allometries for several life history (metabolism, lifespan, reproductive rate, survival) and ecological (population density, home range) traits may evolve from the spatial dimensionality (d) of the intra-specific interactive competition that selects net assimilated energy into mass, with 1/4 exponents being the two-dimensional (2D) case of the more general 1/2d (Witting, 1995). While the exponents for mass-specific metabolism cluster around the predicted -1/4 and -1/6 in terrestrial and pelagic vertebrates, the allometries of mobile organisms are more diverse than the prediction. An exponent around zero has been reported for protists and protozoa (Makarieva et al., 2005, 2008), and the exponent appears to be strongly positive in prokaryotes with a value of about 5/6 (DeLong et al., 2010).
   I show that the natural selection of metabolism and mass is sufficient to explain exponents for mass specific metabolism that decline from 5/6 over zero to -1/6 in 3D, and from 3/4 over zero to -1/4 in 2D. These results suggest that mass-specific metabolism is selected as the pace of the resource handling that generates net energy for self-replication and the selection of mass, with the decline in the metabolic exponent following from a decline in the importance of mass-specific metabolism for the selection of mass. The body mass variation in prokaryotes is found to be selected from primary variation in mass specific metabolism, while the variation in multicellular animals is selected from primary variation in the handling and/or densities of the underlying resources, with protists and protozoa being selected as an intermediate lifeform.

AB  - Genomic imprinting is a form of epigenetic modification involving parent-of -origin-dependent gene expression, usually the inactivation of one gene copy in some tissues, at least, for some part of the diploid life cycle. Occurring at a number of loci in mammals and flowering plants, this mode of non Mendelian expression can be viewed more generally as parentally-specific differential gene expression. The effects of natural selection on genetic variation at imprinted loci have previously been examined in a several population-genetic models. Here we expand the existing one-locus, two-allele population genetic models of viability selection with genomic imprinting to include sex-limited imprinting, i.e., imprinted expression occurring only in one sex, and differential viability between the sexes. We first consider models of complete inactivation of either parental allele and these models are subsequently generalized to incorporate differential expression. Stable polymorphic equilibrium was possible without heterozygote advantage as observed in some prior models of imprinting in both sexes. In contrast to these latter models, in the sex-limited case it was critical whether the paternally inherited or maternally inherited allele was inactivated. The parental origin of inactivated alleles had a different impact on how the population responded to the different selection pressures between the sexes. Under the same fitness parameters, imprinting in the other sex altered the number of possible equilibrium states and their stability. When the parental origin of imprinted alleles and the sex in which they are inactive differ, an allele cannot be inactivated in consecutive generations. The system dynamics became more complex with more equilibrium points emerging. Our results show that selection can interact with epigenetic factors to maintain genetic variation in previously unanticipated ways. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Infectious diseases can seriously impact dynamics of their host species. In this study, we model and analyze an interaction between a sexually transmitted infection and its animal host population affected by a mate-finding Allee effect. Since mating drives both host reproduction and infection transmission, the Allee effect shapes the transmission rate of the infection which we show takes a saturating form. Our model combining sexually transmitted infections with the mate-finding Allee effect in the host produces quite rich dynamics, including oscillations, several multistability regimes, and infection-induced host extinction. However, many of these complex patterns are restricted to a relatively narrow parameter range. We find that the host extinction occurs at intermediate levels of infection virulence, as well as for Allee effect strengths much lower than when the infection is absent. In both cases, a sequence of events comprising destabilization of an endemic equilibrium, growth of oscillation amplitude, and a heteroclinic bifurcation forms an underlying mechanism. We apply our model to the feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) in domestic cats. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Sequential importance sampling algorithms have been defined to estimate likelihoods in models of ancestral population processes. However, these algorithms are based on features of the models with constant population size, and become inefficient when the population size varies in time, making likelihood-based inferences difficult in many demographic situations. In this work, we modify a previous sequential importance sampling algorithm to improve the efficiency of the likelihood estimation. Our procedure is still based on features of the model with constant size, but uses a resampling technique with a new resampling probability distribution depending on the pairwise composite likelihood. We tested our algorithm, called sequential importance sampling with resampling (SISR) on simulated data sets under different demographic cases. In most cases, we divided the computational cost by two for the same accuracy of inference, in some cases even by one hundred. This study provides the first assessment of the impact of such resampling techniques on parameter inference using sequential importance sampling, and extends the range of situations where likelihood inferences can be easily performed.

AB  - We establish a link between Wakeley et al.'s (2012) cyclical pedigree model from population genetics and a randomized directed configuration model (DCM) considered by Cooper and Frieze (2004). We then exploit this link in combination with asymptotic results for the in-degree distribution of the corresponding DCM to compute the asymptotic size of the largest strongly connected component S-N (where N is the population size) of the DCM resp. the pedigree. The size of the giant component can be characterized explicitly (amounting to approximately 80% of the total populations size) and thus contributes to a reduced 'pedigree effective population size'. In addition, the second largest strongly connected component is only of size O(log N). Moreover, we describe the size and structure of the 'domain of attraction' of S-N. In particular, we show that with high probability for any individual the shortest ancestral line reaches S-N after O(log log N) generations, while almost all other ancestral lines take at most O(logN) generations.

AB  - Cooperative interactions, their stability and evolution, provide an interesting context in which to study the interface between cellular and population levels of organization. Here we study a public goods model relevant to microorganism populations actively extracting a growth resource from their environment. Cells can display one of two phenotypes - a productive phenotype that extracts the resources at a cost, and a non-productive phenotype that only consumes the same resource. Both proliferate and are free to move by diffusion; growth rate and diffusion coefficient depend only weakly phenotype. We analyze the continuous differential equation model as well as simulate stochastically the full dynamics. We find that the two sub-populations, which cannot coexist in a well-mixed environment, develop spatio-temporal patterns that enable long-term coexistence in the shared environment. These patterns are purely fluctuation-driven, as the corresponding continuous spatial system does not display Turing instability. The average stability of coexistence patterns derives from a dynamic mechanism in which the producing sub-population equilibrates with the environmental resource and holds it close to an extinction transition of the other sub-population, causing it to constantly hover around this transition. Thus the ecological interactions support a mechanism reminiscent of self-organized criticality; power-law distributions and long-range correlations are found. The results are discussed in the context of general pattern formation and critical behavior in ecology as well as in an experimental context. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - New automated and high-throughput methods allow the manipulation and selection of numerous bacterial populations. In this manuscript we are interested in the neutral diversity patterns that emerge from such a setup in which many bacterial populations are grown in parallel serial transfers, in some cases with populationwide extinction and splitting events. We model bacterial growth by a birth-death process and use the theory of coalescent point processes. We show that there is a dilution factor that optimises the expected amount of neutral diversity for a given number of cycles, and study the power law behaviour of the mutation frequency spectrum for different experimental regimes. We also explore how neutral variation diverges between two recently split populations by establishing a new formula for the expected number of shared and private mutations. Finally, we show the interest of such a setup to select a phenotype of interest that requires multiple mutations.

AB  - Game theory has emerged as an important tool to understand interacting populations in the last 50 years. Game theory has been applied to study population dynamics with optimal behavior in simple ecosystem models, but existing methods are generally not applicable to complex systems. In order to use game-theory for population dynamics in heterogeneous habitats, habitats are usually split into patches and game-theoretic methods are used to find optimal patch distributions at every instant. However, populations in the real world interact in continuous space, and the assumption of decisions based on perfect information is a large simplification. Here, we develop a method to study population dynamics for interacting populations, distributed optimally in continuous space. A continuous setting allows us to model bounded rationality, and its impact on population dynamics. This is made possible by our numerical advances in solving multiplayer games in continuous space. Our approach hinges on reformulating the instantaneous game, applying an advanced discretization method and modern optimization software to solve it. We apply the method to an idealized case involving the population dynamics and vertical distribution of forage fish preying on copepods. Incorporating continuous space and time, we can model the seasonal variation in the migration, separating the effects of light and population numbers. We arrive at qualitative agreement with empirical findings. Including bounded rationality gives rise to spatial distributions corresponding to reality, while the population dynamics for bounded rationality and complete rationality are equivalent. Our approach is general, and can easily be used for complex ecosystems. (c) 2022 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - We construct a family of genealogy-valued Markov processes that are induced by a continuous-time Markov population process. We derive exact expressions for the likelihood of a given genealogy conditional on the history of the underlying population process. These lead to a nonlinear filtering equation which can be used to design efficient Monte Carlo inference algorithms. We demonstrate these calculations with several examples. Existing full-information approaches for phylodynamic inference are special cases of the theory. (c) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Cultural macroevolution concerns a long-term evolutionary process involving transmission of nongenetic or cultural traits between populations as well as birth and death of populations. To understand the spatial dynamics of cultural macroevolution, we present a one-locus model of cultural diffusion in which a cultural trait is transmitted on a network of populations. Borrowing the method of ancestral backward process from population genetics, our model explores the lineage of a trait variant sampled in the present generation to quantify when and where the variant was invented. Mathematical analysis of the model enables us to predict the distribution of cultural age in each population of the network, estimate the frequencies of trait variants originating from given populations, and discuss the time it takes for a trait variant to diffuse between a given pair of populations. We also perform numerical analysis on random scale-free network of populations to investigate the effect of network topology and innovation rate on the age and origin of variants in each population. The result suggests that trait variants are more likely to derive from a population with higher innovation rate. Our numerical analysis also shows that trait variants invented in populations with higher network-centrality values are likely to be maintained at a higher frequency and transmitted to other populations in a shorter time period.

AB  - We consider the problem of estimating the elapsed time since the most recent common ancestor of a finite random sample drawn from a population which has evolved through a Bienayme-Galton-Watson branching process. More specifically, we are interested in the diffusion limit appropriate to a supercritical process in the near-critical limit evolving over a large number of time steps. Our approach differs from earlier analyses in that we assume the only known information is the mean and variance of the number of offspring per parent, the observed total population size at the time of sampling, and the size of the sample. We obtain a formula for the probability that a finite random sample of the population is descended from a single ancestor in the initial population, and derive a confidence interval for the initial population size in terms of the final population size and the time since initiating the process. We also determine a joint likelihood surface from which confidence regions can be determined for simultaneously estimating two parameters, (1) the population size at the time of the most recent common ancestor, and (2) the time elapsed since the existence of the most recent common ancestor.

AB  - Natural selection can favour cooperation, but it is unclear when cooperative populations should be larger than less cooperative ones. While experiments have shown that cooperation can increase population size, cooperation and population size can become negatively correlated if spatial processes affect both variables in opposite directions. We use a simple mathematical model of spatial common-pool resource production to investigate how space affects the cooperation-population size relationship. We find that only cooperation that is sufficiently beneficial to neighbours increases population size. However, spatial clustering variations can create a negative cooperation-population relationship between populations even when cooperation is highly beneficial, because clustering selects for cooperation but decreases population size. Individual-based simulations with variable individual movement rates produced variation in spatial clustering and the hypothesized negative cooperation-population relationships. These results suggest that variation in spatial clustering can limit the size of evolutionarily stable cooperating populations - an ecological dilemma of cooperation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - In a geographically structured population, partial global panmixia can be regarded as the limiting case of long-distance migration. On the entire line with homogeneous, isotropic migration, an environmental pocket is bounded by a geographical barrier, which need not be symmetric. For slow evolution, a continuous approximation of the exact, discrete model for the gene frequency p(x) at a diallelic locus at equilibrium, where x denotes position and the barrier is at x = +/- a, is formulated and investigated. This model incorporates viability selection, local adult migration, adult partial panmixia, and the barrier. The gene frequency and its derivatives are discontinuous at the barrier unless the latter is symmetric, in which case only p(x) is discontinuous. A dine exists only if the scaled rate of partial panmixia beta < 1; several qualitative results also are proved. Formulas that determine p(x) in a step-environment when dominance is absent are derived. The maximal gene frequency in the dine satisfies p(0) < 1 - beta. A dine exists if and only if 0 <= beta < 1 and the radius a of the pocket exceeds the minimal radius a*, for which a simple, explicit formula is deduced. Given numerical solutions for p(0) and p(a +/-), an explicit formula is proved for p(x) in vertical bar x vertical bar > a; whereas in (-a, a), an elliptic integral for x must be numerically inverted. The minimal radius a** for maintenance of a dine in an isotropic, bidimensional pocket is also examined. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Marine protected areas (MPAs) are regions in the ocean where fishing is restricted or prohibited. Although several measures for MPA performance exist, here we focus on a specific one, namely the ratio of the steady state fish densities inside and outside the MPA. Several 2 patch models are proposed and analyzed mathematically. One patch represents the MPA, whereas the second patch represents the fishing ground. Fish move freely between both regions in a diffusive manner. Our main objective is to understand how fish mobility affects MPA performance. We show that MPA effectiveness decreases with fish mobility for single species models with logistic growth, and that densities inside and outside the MPA tend to equalize. This suggests that MPA performance is highest for the least mobile species. We then consider a 2 patch Lotka-Volterra predator-prey system. When one of the species moves, and the other does not, the ratio of the moving species first remains constant, and ultimately decreases with increased fish mobility, again with a tendency of equalization of the density in both regions. This suggests that MPA performance is not only highest for slow, but also for moderately mobile species. The discrepancy in MPA performance for single species models and for predator-prey models, confirms that MPA design requires an integrated, ecosystem-based approach. The mathematical approaches advocated here complement and enhance the numerical and theoretical approaches that are commonly applied to more complex models in the context of MPA design.

AB  - Some genes or gene complexes are transmitted from parents to offsprihg at a greater-than-Mendelian rate, and can spread and persist in populations even if they cause some harm to the individuals carrying them. Such genes may be useful for controlling populations or species that are harmful. Driving-Y chromosomes may be particularly potent in this regard, as they produce a male-biased sex ratio that, if sufficiently extreme, can lead to population elimination. To better understand the potential of such genes to spread over a landscape, we have developed a series of reaction-diffusion models of a driving-Y chromosome in 1-D and radially-symmetric 2-D unbounded domains. The wild-type system at carrying capacity is found to be unstable to the introduction of driving-Y males for all models investigated. Numerical solutions exhibit travelling wave pulses and fronts, and analytical and semi-analytical solutions for the asymptotic wave speed under bounded initial conditions are derived. The driving-Y male invades the wild-type equilibrium state at the front of the wave and completely replaces the wild-type males, leaving behind, at the tail of the wave, a reduced- or zero-population state of females and driving-Y males only. In our simplest model of a population with one life stage and density-dependent mortality, wave speed depends on the strength of drive and the diffusion rate of Y-drive males, and is independent of the population dynamic consequences (suppression or elimination). Incorporating an immobile juvenile stage of fixed duration into the model reduces wave speed approximately in proportion to the relative time spent as a juvenile. If females mate just once in their life, storing sperm for subsequent reproduction, then wave speed depends on the movement of mated females as well as Y-drive males, and may be faster or slower than in the multiple-mating model, depending on the relative duration of juvenile and adult life stages. Numerical solutions are shown for parameter values that may in part be representative for Anopheles gambiae, the primary vector of malaria in sub-Saharan Africa. (C) 2015 The Authors.

AB  - We study a simple model for generation cycles, which are oscillations with a period of one or a few generation times of the species. The model is formulated in terms of a single delay-differential equation for the population density of an adult stage, with recruitment to the adult stage depending on the intensity of competition during the juvenile phase. This model is a simplified version of a group of models proposed by Gurney and Nisbet, who were the first to distinguish between single-generation cycles and delayed-feedback cycles. According to these authors, the two oscillation types are caused by different mechanisms and have periods in different intervals, which are one to two generation times for single-generation cycles and two to four generation times for delayed-feedback cycles. By abolishing the strict coupling between the maturation time and the time delay between competition and its effect on the population dynamics, we find that single-generation cycles and delayed-feedback cycles occur in the same model version, with a gradual transition between the two as the model parameters are varied over a sufficiently large range. Furthermore, cycle periods are not bounded to lie within single octaves. This implies that a clear distinction between different types of generation cycles is not possible. Cycles of all periods and even chaos can be generated by varying the parameters that determine the time during which individuals from different cohorts compete with each other. This suggests that life-cycle features in the juvenile stage and during the transition to the adult stage are important determinants of the dynamics of density limited populations.

AB  - In a population of individuals, whose mortality is governed by a Gompertz- Makeham hazard, we derive closed-form solutions to the life-expectancy integral, corresponding to the cases of homogeneous and gamma-heterogeneous populations, as well as in the presence/absence of the Makeham term. Derived expressions contain special functions that aid constructing high-accuracy approximations, which can be used to study the elasticity of life expectancy with respect to model parameters. Knowledge of Gompertz-Makeham life expectancies aids constructing life-table exposures. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Beneficial mutations can co-occur when population structure slows down adaptation. Here, we consider the process of adaptation in asexual populations distributed over several locations ("islands"). New beneficial mutations arise at constant rate u(b), and each mutation has the same selective advantage s > 0. We assume that populations evolve within islands according to the successional mutations regime of Desai and Fisher (2007), that is, the time to local fixation of a mutation is short compared to the expected waiting time until the next mutation occurs. To study the rate of adaptation, we introduce an approximate model, the successional mutations (SM) model, which can be simulated efficiently and yields accurate results for a wide range of parameters. In the SM model, mutations fix instantly within islands, and migrants can take over the destination island if they are fitter than the residents. For the special case of a population distributed equally across two islands with population size N, we approximate the model further for small and large migration rates in comparison to the mutation rate. These approximations lead to explicit formulas for the rate of adaptation which fit the original model for a large range of parameter values. For the d island case we provide some heuristics on how to extend the explicit formulas and check these with computer simulations. We conclude that the SM model is a good approximation of the adaptation process in a structured population, at least if mutation or migration is limited. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Using models for unstructured populations, we investigate the effect of environmental variability on population growth when the environment affects vital rates through nonlinear functions. We focus here especially on interannual variation in food resources availability, for which sigmoid functions are relevant. Considering first unregulated populations in stochastic environments, we show that classic sigmoid annual growth rates cannot lead to positive effects of increased environmental variability on population growth. This is true even when the temporal average of food availability is low, and Jensen's inequality predicts an increased arithmetic mean of the annual growth rate. The result is due to the log-concavity of many sigmoid (and other accelerating) functions, as convexity of the logarithm of the annual growth rate is needed for positive effects of variability to appear. Then, separating the effects of a food availability variable on reproduction and survival rates, we show that populations with less sensitive survival rate to food are more likely to benefit from food variability-as opposed to populations that have survival rates accelerating with food availability, which is rather counterintuitive given Jensen's inequality. Again, this is explained by log-convexity properties of nonlinear functions. We further extend these results to regulated populations, in which similar positive effects of food variability can affect average population size. Positive variability effects seem however more likely to occur in regulated populations. Finally, we extend our results to stage-structured populations. We connect to the previous work showing positive effects of environmental variability with matrix models, and show that these effects are well captured by simpler unstructured models.

AB  - When a mutation with selective advantage s spreads through a panmictic population, it may cause two lineages at a linked locus to coalesce; the probability of coalescence is exp(-2rT), where T similar to log(2Ns)/s is the time to fixation, N is the number of haploid individuals, and r is the recombination rate. Population structure delays fixation, and so weakens the effect of a selective sweep. However, favourable alleles spread through a spatially continuous population behind a narrow wavefront; ancestral lineages are confined at the tip of this front, and so coalesce rapidly. In extremely dense populations, coalescence is dominated by rare fluctuations ahead of the front. However, we show that for moderate densities, a simple quasi-deterministic approximation applies: the rate of coalescence within the front is lambda similar to 2g(eta)/(rho l), where rho is the population density and l = sigma root 2/s is the characteristic scale of the wavefront; g(eta) depends only on the strength of random drift, eta = rho sigma root 2/s. The net effect of a sweep on coalescence also depends crucially on whether two lineages are ever both within the wavefront at the same time: even in the extreme case when coalescence within the front is instantaneous, the net rate of coalescence may be lower than in a single panmictic population. Sweeps can also have a substantial impact on the rate of gene flow. A single lineage will jump to a new location when it is hit by a sweep, with mean square displacement sigma(2)(eff)/sigma(2) = (8/3)(L/l)(Lambda/R); this can be substantial if the species' range, L, is large, even if the species-wide rate of sweeps per map length, Lambda/R, is small. This effect is half as strong in two dimensions. In contrast, the rate of coalescence between lineages, at random locations in space and on the genetic map, is proportional to (c/L)(Lambda/R), where c is the wavespeed: thus, on average, one-dimensional structure is likely to reduce coalescence due to sweeps, relative to panmixis. In two dimensions, genes must move along the front before they can coalesce; this process is rapid, being dominated by rare fluctuations. This leads to a dramatically higher rate of coalescence within the wavefront than if lineages simply diffused along the front. Nevertheless, the net rate of coalescence due to a sweep through a two-dimensional population is likely to be lower than it would be with panmixis. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The fixation index F-ST and the coefficient of gene differentiation G(ST) are analyzed for the finite island model under short time spans, ignoring mutations. Dividing the reproduction cycle into the three steps - gamete formation, fertilization, and migration - we develop a new approach for computing quasi equilibrium formulas for F-ST (and G(ST)). Our formulas generalize earlier ones and reveal that the equilibrium value of F-ST is influenced not only by the migration rate and local effective population size, N-e, but also by the local census size N, particularly so when the migration rate is high. The order of migration and fertilization is found to have a smaller effect on F-ST. A major advantage compared to previous approaches is that stochastic allele frequency of migrants is easily accommodated, thereby avoiding underestimation of F-ST for large migration rates.

AB  - A fast algorithm for computing multi-locus recombination is extended to include a recombination-modifier locus. This algorithm and a linear stability analysis is used to investigate the evolution of recombination rates in a multi-locus, haploid-selection, symmetric-viability model for which stable equilibria have recently been determined. When the starting equilibrium is symmetric with two selected loci, we show analytically that modifier alleles that reduce recombination always invade. When the starting equilibrium is monomorphic, and there is a fixed nonzero recombination rate between the modifier locus and the selected loci, we determine analytical conditions for which a modifier allele can invade. In particular, we show that a gap exists between the recombination rates of modifiers that can invade and the recombination rate that specifies the lower stability boundary of the monomorphic equilibrium. A numerical investigation shows that a similar gap exists in a weakened form when the starting equilibrium is fully polymorphic but asymmetric. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Competition between individuals for resources which are limited and diverse in composition is the ultimate driving force of evolution. Classical studies of this event contend that the outcome is a deterministic process predicted by the growth rate of the competing types a tenet called the Malthusian selection principle. Recent studies of competition indicate that the dynamics of selection is a stochastic process, regulated by the population size, the abundance and diversity of the resource, and predicted by evolutionary entropy a statistical parameter which characterizes the rate at which the population returns to the steady state condition after a random endogenous or exogenous perturbation. This tenet, which we will call the entropic selection principle entails the following relations:
   (a) When resources are constant, limited and diverse, variants with higher entropy will have a selective advantage and increase in frequency.
   (b) When resources undergo large variations in abundance and are singular, variants with lower entropy will have a selective advantage and increase in frequency.
   This article delineates the analytic, computational and empirical support for this tenet. We show moreover that the Malthusian selection principle, a cornerstone of classical evolutionary genetics, is the limit, as population size and resource abundance tends to infinity of the entropic selection principle. The Malthusian tenet is an approximation to the entropic selection principle an approximation whose validity increases with increasing population size and increasing resource abundance. Evolutionary entropy is a generic concept that characterizes the interaction dynamics of metabolic entities at several levels of biological organization: cellular, organismic and ecological. Accordingly, the entropic selection principle represents a general rule for explaining the processes of adaptation and evolution at each of these levels. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Consider the diffusion process defined by the forward equation u(t)(t, x) = 1/2 {xu(t, x)}(xx) - alpha{xu(t, x)}(x) for t, x >= 0 and -infinity < alpha < infinity, with an initial condition u(0, x) = delta(x - x(0)). This equation was introduced and solved by Feller to model the growth of a population of independently reproducing individuals. We explore important coalescent processes related to Feller's solution. For any alpha and x(0) > 0 we calculate the distribution of the random variable A(n)(s;t), defined as the finite number of ancestors at a time s in the past of a sample of size n taken from the infinite population of a Feller diffusion at a time t since its initiation. In a subcritical diffusion we find the distribution of population and sample coalescent trees from time t back, conditional on non-extinction as t -> infinity. In a supercritical diffusion we construct a coalescent tree which has a single founder and derive the distribution of coalescent times.

AB  - Many traits in populations are well understood as being Mendelian effects at single loci or additive polygenic effects across numerous loci. However, there are important phenomena and traits that are intermediate between these two extremes and are known as oligogenic traits. Here we investigate digenic, or two-locus, traits and how their frequencies in populations are affected by non-random mating, specifically inbreeding, linkage disequilibrium, and selection. These effects are examined both separately and in combination to demonstrate how many digenic traits, especially double homozygous ones, can show significant, sometimes unexpected, changes in population frequency with inbreeding, linkage, and linkage disequilibrium. The effects of selection on deleterious digenic traits are also detailed. These results are applied to both digenic traits of medical significance as well as measuring inbreeding in natural populations.(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Inbreeding results from the mating of related individuals and has negative consequences because it brings together deleterious variants in one individual. Genomic estimates of the inbreeding coefficients are preferred to pedigree-based estimators as they measure the realized inbreeding levels and they are more robust to pedigree errors. Several methods identifying homozygous-by-descent (HBD) segments with hidden Markov models (HMM) have been recently developed and are particularly valuable when the information is degraded or heterogeneous (e.g., low-fold sequencing, low marker density, heterogeneous genotype quality or variable marker spacing). We previously developed a multiple HBD class HMM where HBD segments are classified in different groups based on their length (e.g., recent versus old HBD segments) but we recently observed that for high inbreeding levels with many HBD segments, the estimated contributions might be biased towards more recent classes (i.e., associated with large HBD segments) although the overall estimated level of inbreeding remained unbiased. We herein propose a new model in which the HBD classification is modelled in successive nested levels with decreasing expected HBD segment lengths, the underlying exponential rates being directly related to the number of generations to the common ancestor. The non-HBD classes are now modelled as a mixture of HBD segments from later generations and shorter non-HBD segments (i.e., both with higher rates). The new model has improved statistical properties and performs better on simulated data compared to our previous version. We also show that the parameters of the model are easier to interpret and that the model is more robust to the choice of the number of classes. Overall, the new model results in an improved partitioning of inbreeding in different HBD classes and should be preferred. (C)& nbsp;2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this paper we develop a class of models to study a population and resource dynamical system in which the decision to give birth is based on a rational far-sighted cost-benefit analysis on what the future of the resource level will be. This leads to consider a system in which a time forward population/resource dynamical system is coupled with a time backward Bellman's equation (which models the choice of having a child). We construct, from a population model with food consumption, an example, to study the change in time of the fertility rate when a catastrophic change in resource is announced at a given moment, when a birth control policy is announced and we compare these two announcements in case nothing happens. Moreover, we provide, mathematical tools to theoretically and numerically study this complex coupling of time forward and time backward equations. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Long-term evolution of quantitative traits is classically and usefully described as the directional change in phenotype due to the recurrent fixation of new mutations. A formal justification for such continual evolution ultimately relies on the "invasion implies substitution"-principle. Here, whenever a mutant allele causing a small phenotypic change can successfully invade a population, the ancestral (or wild-type) allele will be replaced, whereby fostering gradual phenotypic change if the process is repeated. It has been argued that this principle holds in a broad range of situations, including spatially and demographically structured populations experiencing frequency- and density-dependent selection under demographic and environmental fluctuations. However, prior studies have not been able to account for all aspects of population structure, leaving unsettled the conditions under which the "invasion implies substitution"-principle really holds. In this paper, we start by laying out a program to explore and clarify the generality of the "invasion implies substitution"-principle. Particular focus is given on finding an explicit and functionally constant representation of the selection gradient on a quantitative trait. Using geometric singular perturbation methods, we then show that the "invasion implies substitution"-principle generalizes to well-mixed and scalar-valued polymorphic multispecies ecological communities that are structured into finitely many demographic (or physiological) classes. The selection gradient is shown to be constant over the evolutionary timescale and that it depends only on the resident phenotype, individual growth-rates, population steady states and reproductive values, all of which are calculated from the resident dynamics. Our work contributes to the theoretical foundations of evolutionary ecology. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The stationary sampling distribution of a neutral decoupled Moran or Wright-Fisher diffusion with neutral mutations is known to first order for a general rate matrix with small but otherwise unconstrained mutation rates. Using this distribution as a starting point we derive results for maximum likelihood estimates of scaled mutation rates from site frequency data under three model assumptions: a twelve-parameter general rate matrix, a nine-parameter reversible rate matrix, and a six-parameter strand-symmetric rate matrix. The site frequency spectrum is assumed to be sampled from a fixed size population in equilibrium, and to consist of allele frequency data at a large number of unlinked sites evolving with a common mutation rate matrix without selective bias. We correct an error in a previous treatment of the same problem (Burden and Tang, 2017) affecting the estimators for the general and strand-symmetric rate matrices. The method is applied to a biological dataset consisting of a site frequency spectrum extracted from short autosomal introns in a sample of Drosophila melanogaster individuals. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Genome sequencing has revealed that prophages, viral sequences integrated in a bacterial chromosome, are abundant, accounting for as much as 20% of the bacterial genome. These sequences can confer fitness benefits to the bacterial host, but may also instigate cell death through induction. Several recent investigations have revealed that the distribution of prophage lengths is bimodal, with a clear distinction between small and large prophages. Here we develop a mathematical model of the evolutionary forces affecting the prophage size distribution, and fit this model to three recent data sets. This approach offers quantitative estimates for the relative rates of lysogeny, induction, mutational degradation and selection acting on a wide class of prophage sequences. The model predicts that large prophages are predominantly maintained by the introduction of new prophage sequences through lysogeny, whereas shorter prophages can be enriched when they no longer encode the genes necessary for induction, but still offer selective benefits to their hosts.

AB  - Genetic exchange in microbes and other facultative sexuals can be rare enough that evolution is almost entirely asexual and populations almost clonal. But the benefits of genetic exchange depend crucially on the diversity of genotypes in a population. How very rare recombination together with the accumulation of new mutations shapes the diversity of large populations and gives rise to faster adaptation is still poorly understood. This paper analyzes a particularly simple model: organisms with two asexual chromosomes that can reassort during rare matings that occur at a rate r. The speed of adaptation for large population sizes, N, is found to depend on the ratio similar to log(Nr)/log(N). For larger populations, the r needed to yield the same speed decreases as a power of N. Remarkably, the population undergoes spontaneous oscillations alternating between phases when the fittest individuals are created by mutation and when they are created by reassortment, which - in contrast to conventional regimes - decreases the diversity. Between the two phases, the mean fitness jumps rapidly. The oscillatory dynamics and the strong fluctuations this induces have implications for the diversity and coalescent statistics. The results are potentially applicable to large microbial populations, especially viruses that have a small number of chromosomes. Some of the key features may be more broadly applicable for large populations with other types of rare genetic exchange. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The adult sex ratio (ASR) is defined as the number of fertile males divided by the number of fertile females in a population. We build an ODE model with minimal age structure, in which males compete for paternities using either a multiple-mating or searching-then-guarding strategy, to investigate the value of ASR as an index for predicting which strategy males will adopt, with a focus in our investigation on the differences of strategy choice between chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and human hunter-gatherers (Homo sapiens). Parameters in the model characterise aspects of life history and behaviour, and determine both dominant strategy and the ASR when the population is at or near equilibrium. Sensitivity analysis on the model parameters informs us that ASR is strongly influenced by parameters characterising life history, while dominant strategy is affected most strongly by the effectiveness of guarding (average length of time a guarded pair persists, and resistance to paternity theft) and moderately by some life history traits. For fixed effectiveness of guarding and other parameters, dominant strategy tends to change from multiple mating to guarding along a curve that aligns well with a contour of constant ASR, under variation of parameters such as longevity and age female fertility ends. This confirms the hypothesis that ASR may be a useful index for predicting the optimal male mating strategy, provided we have some limited information about ecology and behaviour.

AB  - Previous mathematical analyses have shown that, for certain parameter ranges, a population, described by logistic equations on a set of connected patches, and diffusing among them, can reach a higher equilibrium total population when the local carrying capacities are heterogeneously distributed across patches, than when carrying capacities having the same total sum are homogeneously distributed across the patches. It is shown here that this apparently paradoxical result is explained when the resultant differences in energy inputs to the whole multi-patch system are taken into account. We examine both Pearl-Verhulst and Original Verhulst logistic models and show that, when total input of energy or limiting resource, is constrained to be the same in the homogeneous and heterogeneous cases, the total population in the heterogeneous patches can never reach an asymptotic equilibrium that is greater than the sum of the carrying capacities over the homogeneous patches. We further show that, when the dynamics of the limiting resources are explicitly modeled, as in a chemostat model, the paradoxical result of the logistic models does not occur. These results have implications concerning the use of some ubiquitous equations of population ecology in modeling populations in space. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Seed banks are common characteristics to many plant species, which allow storage of genetic diversity in the soil as dormant seeds for various periods of time. We investigate an above-ground population following a Fisher-Wright model with selection coupled with a deterministic seed bank assuming the length of the seed bank is kept constant and the number of seeds is large. To assess the combined impact of seed banks and selection on genetic diversity, we derive a general diffusion model. The applied techniques outline a path of approximating a stochastic delay differential equation by an appropriately rescaled stochastic differential equation. We compute the equilibrium solution of the site-frequency spectrum and derive the times to fixation of an allele with and without selection. Finally, it is demonstrated that seed banks enhance the effect of selection onto the site-frequency spectrum while slowing down the time until the mutation-selection equilibrium is reached.

AB  - Population genetic differentiation characterizes the repartition of alleles among populations. It is commonly thought that genetic differentiation measures, such as G(ST) and D, should be near zero when allele frequencies are close to their expected value in panmictic populations, and close to one when they are close to their expected value in isolated populations. To analyse those properties, we first derive analytically a reference function f of known parameters that describes how important features of genetic differentiation (e.g. gene diversity, proportion of private alleles, frequency of the most common allele) are close to their expected panmictic and isolation value. We find that the behaviour of function f differs according to three distinct mutation regimes defined by the scaled mutation rate and the number of populations. Then, we compare G(ST) and D to f, and demonstrate that their signal of differentiation strongly depends on the mutation regime. In particular, we show that D captures well the variations of genetic diversity when mutation is weak, otherwise it overestimates it when panmixia is not met.

AB  - Sensitivity analysis of structured populations is a useful tool in population ecology. Historically, methodological development of sensitivity analysis has focused on the sensitivity of eigenvalues in linear matrix models, and on single populations. More recently there have been extensions to the sensitivity of nonlinear models, and to communities of interacting populations. Here we derive a fully general mathematical expression for the sensitivity of equilibrium abundances in communities of interacting structured populations. Our method yields the response of an arbitrary function of the stage class abundances to perturbations of any model parameters. As a demonstration, we apply this sensitivity analysis to a two-species model of ontogenetic niche shift where each species has two stage classes, juveniles and adults. In the context of this model, we demonstrate that our theory is quite robust to violating two of its technical assumptions: the assumption that the community is at a point equilibrium and the assumption of infinitesimally small parameter perturbations. Our results on the sensitivity of a community are also interpreted in a niche theoretical context: we determine how the niche of a structured population is composed of the niches of the individual states, and how the sensitivity of the community depends on niche segregation.

AB  - Social learning mechanisms are widely thought to vary in their degree of complexity as well as in their prevalence in the natural world. While learning the properties of a stimulus that generalize to similar stimuli at other locations (stimulus enhancement) prima fade appears more useful to an animal than learning about a specific stimulus at a specific location (local enhancement), empirical evidence suggests that the latter is much more widespread in nature. Simulating populations engaged in a producer scrounger game, we sought to deploy mathematical models to identify the adaptive benefits of reliance on local enhancement and/or stimulus enhancement, and the alternative conditions favoring their evolution. Surprisingly, we found that while stimulus enhancement readily evolves, local enhancement is advantageous only under highly restricted conditions: when generalization of information was made unreliable or when error in social learning was high. Our results generate a conundrum over how seemingly conflicting empirical and theoretical findings can be reconciled. Perhaps the prevalence of local enhancement in nature is due to stimulus enhancement costs independent of the learning task itself (e.g. predation risk), perhaps natural habitats are often characterized by unreliable yet highly rewarding payoffs, or perhaps local enhancement occurs less frequently, and stimulus enhancement more frequently, than widely believed.

AB  - A dynamic, two-sex, age-structured marriage model is presented. Part 1 focused on first marriage only and described a marriage market matching algorithm. In Part 2 the model is extended to include divorce, widowing, and remarriage. The model Produces a self-consistent set of marital states distributed by age and sex in a stable population by means of a gender-symmetric numerical method. The model is compared with empirical data for the case of Zambia. Furthermore, a dynamic marriage function for a changing population is demonstrated in simulations of three hypothetical scenarios of elevated mortality in young to middle adulthood. The marriage model has its primary application to simulation of HIV-AIDS epidemics in African countries. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Tree-killing bark beetle infestations area cause of massive coniferous forest mortality impacting forest ecosystems and the ecosystem services they provide. Models predicting bark beetle outbreaks are crucial for forest management and conservation, necessitating studies of the effect of epidemiological traits on the probability and severity of outbreaks. Due to the aggregation behaviour of beetles and host tree defence, this epidemiological interaction is highly non-linear and outbreak behaviour remains poorly understood, motivating questions about when an outbreak can occur, what determines outbreak severity, and how aggregation behaviour modulates these quantities. Here, we apply the principle of distributed delays to create a novel and mathematically tractable model for beetle aggregation in an epidemiological framework. We derive the critical outbreak threshold for the beetle emergence rate, which is a quantity analogous to the basic reproductive ratio, R 0 , for epidemics. Beetle aggregation qualitatively impacts outbreak potential from depending on the emergence rate alone in the absence of aggregation to depending on both emergence rate and initial beetle density when aggregation is required. Finally, we use a stochastic model to confirm that our deterministic model predictions are robust in finite populations.

AB  - Cooperation usually becomes harder to sustain as groups become larger because incentives to shirk increase with the number of potential contributors to collective action. But is this always the case? Here we study a binary-action cooperative dilemma where a public good is provided as long as not more than a given number of players shirk from a costly cooperative task. We find that at the stable polymorphic equilibrium, which exists when the cost of cooperation is low enough, the probability of cooperating increases with group size and reaches a limit of one when the group size tends to infinity. Nevertheless, increasing the group size may increase or decrease the probability that the public good is provided at such an equilibrium, depending on the cost value. We also prove that the expected payoff to individuals at the stable polymorphic equilibrium (i.e., their fitness) decreases with group size. For low enough costs of cooperation, both the probability of provision of the public good and the expected payoff converge to positive values in the limit of large group sizes. However, we also find that the basin of attraction of the stable polymorphic equilibrium is a decreasing function of group size and shrinks to zero in the limit of very large groups. Overall, we demonstrate non-trivial comparative statics with respect to group size in an otherwise simple collective action problem.

AB  - Plasmids may carry genes coding for beneficial traits and thus contribute to adaptation of bacterial populations to environmental stress. Conjugative plasmids can horizontally transfer between cells, which a priori facilitates the spread of adaptive alleles. However, if the potential recipient cell is already colonized by another incompatible plasmid, successful transfer may be prevented. Competition between plasmids can thus limit horizontal transfer. Previous modeling has indeed shown that evolutionary rescue by a conjugative plasmid is hampered by incompatible resident plasmids in the population. If the rescue plasmid is a mutant variant of the resident plasmid, both plasmids transfer at the same rates. A high conjugation rate then has two, potentially opposing, effects - a direct positive effect on spread of the rescue plasmid and an increase in the fraction of resident plasmid cells. This raises the question whether a high conjugation rate always benefits evolutionary rescue. In this article, we systematically analyze three models of increasing complexity to disentangle the benefits and limits of increasing horizontal gene transfer in the presence of plasmid competition and plasmid costs. We find that the net effect can be positive or negative and that the optimal transfer rate is thus not always the highest one. These results can contribute to our understanding of the many facets of plasmid-driven adaptation and the wide range of transfer rates observed in nature.

AB  - Cooperation is considered a mysterious phenomenon from the perspective of adaptive evolution. However, if an individual can separate from an unsatisfactory group and join another, then this can facilitate positive assortment between cooperative types and promote the evolution of cooperation. What kind of disbandment rule most facilitates the evolution of cooperation? A previous study investigated exogenous disbandment rules and showed that, when games are played between two players, a rule where heterogeneous groups disband facilitates the evolution of cooperation. However, in groups of more than two individuals, a rule strictly requiring homogeneity applied if and only if the expected number of rounds played in a group was greater than some critical value. How large is the critical value? In this study, we make a mathematical analysis using evolutionary game theory. Our results show that the critical number of rounds increases greatly as the group size increases. Consequently, for species with large group sizes, e.g., Homo sapiens, under plausible parameter values, the strict homogeneity rule is unlikely to facilitate the evolution of cooperation. We find instead that a disbandment rule that requires a threshold level of homogeneity outperformed the strict homogeneity rule. Furthermore, we calculate the position of internal equilibria at which cooperators and defectors coexist and show that the initial evolution of cooperation is most encouraged when cooperators are tolerant (intolerant) of defectors if the benefit-to-cost ratio is large (small).(c) 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - The allele frequency dependence of the ranges of all measures of linkage disequilibrium is well-known. The maximum values of commonly used parameters such as r(2) and D vary depending on the allele frequencies at each locus. However, though this phenomenon is recognized and accounted for in many studies, the comprehensive mathematical framework underlying the limits of linkage disequilibrium measures at various frequency combinations is often heuristic or empirical. Here, it is demonstrated that underlying this behavior is the fundamental shift between linear and nonlinear dependence in the linkage disequilibrium structure between loci. The proportion of linear and nonlinear dependence can be estimated and it demonstrates how even the same values of r(2) can have different implications for the nature of the overall dependence. One result of this is the value of D', when defined as only a positive number, has a minimum value of vertical bar r vertical bar. Understanding this dependence is crucial to making correct inferences about the relationships between two loci in linkage disequilibrium. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this paper we develop a general framework for how the genetic composition of a structured population with strong migration between its subunits, evolves over time. The dynamics is described in terms of a vector-valued Markov process of allele, genotype or haplotype frequencies that varies on two time scales. The more rapid changes are random fluctuations in terms of a multivariate autoregressive process, around a quasi equilibrium fix point, whereas the fix point itself varies more slowly according to a diffusion process, along a lower-dimensional subspace. Under mild regularity conditions, the fluctuations have a magnitude inversely proportional to the square root of the population size N, and hence can be used to estimate a broad class of genetically effective population sizes N-e, with genetic data from one time point only. In this way we are able to unify a number of existing notions of effective size, as well as proposing new ones, for instance one that quantifies the extent to which genotype frequencies fluctuate around Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.

AB  - Indirect effects, both density- and trait-mediated, have been known to act in tandem with direct effects in the interactions of numerous species. They have been shown to affect populations embedded in competitive and mutualistic networks alike. In this work, we introduce a four-dimensional system of ordinary differential equations and investigate the interplay between direct density-effects and density- and trait-mediated indirect effects that take place in a yeast parasite-zooplankton host-incompetent competitor system embedded in a food web which also includes resources and predators. Among our main findings is the demonstration that indirect effects cause qualitative and quantitative changes almost indistinguishable from direct effects and the corroboration through our analysis of the fact that the effects of direct and indirect mechanisms cannot be disentangled. Our results underpin the conclusions of past studies calling for comprehensive models that incorporate both direct and indirect effects to better describe field data. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) outbreaks are devastating to poultry industries and pose a risk to human health. There is concern that demand for free-range poultry products could increase the number of HPAI outbreaks by increasing the potential for low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) introduction to commercial flocks. We formulate stochastic mathematical models to understand how poultry-housing (barn, free-range and caged) within the meat and layer sectors interacts with a continuous low-level risk of introduction from wild birds, heterogeneity in virus transmission rates and virus mutation probabilities, to affect the risk of HPAI emergence - at both the shed and industry scales. For H5 and H7 viruses, restricted mixing in caged systems, free-range outdoor access and, particularly, production cycle length significantly influence HPAI risk between sectors of the chicken production industry. Results demonstrate how delay between virus mutation and detection, ensuing from the short production cycle, large shed sizes and industry reporting requirements, could mean that HPAI emerges in meat-production sheds but is undetected with few birds affected. We also find that the Australian HPAI outbreak history appears to be better explained by low LPAI introduction rates and low mutation probabilities, rather than extremely rare introduction and relatively high mutation probabilities.

AB  - Fitness landscapes map genotypes to organismal fitness. Their topographies depend on how mutational effects interact - epistasis - and are important for understanding evolutionary processes such as speciation, the rate of adaptation, the advantage of recombination, and the predictability versus stochasticity of evolution. The growing amount of data has made it possible to better test landscape models empirically. We argue that this endeavor will benefit from the development and use of meaningful basic models against which to compare more complex models. Here we develop statistical and computational methods for fitting fitness data from mutation combinatorial networks to three simple models: additive, multiplicative and stickbreaking. We employ a Bayesian framework for doing model selection. Using simulations, we demonstrate that our methods work and we explore their statistical performance: bias, error, and the power to discriminate among models. We then illustrate our approach and its flexibility by analyzing several previously published datasets. An R-package that implements our methods is available in the CRAN repository under the name Stickbreaker. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - New Zealand has one of the highest (per capita) incidences of human leptospirosis in the world. It is the highest occurring occupational disease in New Zealand, often transmitted from livestock such as deer, sheep and cattle to humans. A cyclical model, showing the dynamics of infection of leptospirosis in farmed livestock in New Zealand, is presented. The limit cycle, bifurcation diagram and quasi-R-0 value of the system are determined. Leptospire death rate is used as a control parameter. Previously published parameter values are used in a case study to produce figures demonstrating analytical results. The model is used to predict conditions under which the infection will persist in the population. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Our focus here is on the infinitesimal model. In this model, one or several quantitative traits are described as the sum of a genetic and a non-genetic component, the first being distributed within families as a normal random variable centred at the average of the parental genetic components, and with a variance independent of the parental traits. Thus, the variance that segregates within families is not perturbed by selection, and can be predicted from the variance components. This does not necessarily imply that the trait distribution across the whole population should be Gaussian, and indeed selection or population structure may have a substantial effect on the overall trait distribution. One of our main aims is to identify some general conditions on the allelic effects for the infinitesimal model to be accurate. We first review the long history of the infinitesimal model in quantitative genetics. Then we formulate the model at the phenotypic level in terms of individual trait values and relationships between individuals, but including different evolutionary processes: genetic drift, recombination, selection, mutation, population structure,....We give a range of examples of its application to evolutionary questions related to stabilising selection, assortative mating, effective population size and response to selection, habitat preference and speciation. We provide a mathematical justification of the model as the limit as the number M of underlying loci tends to infinity of a model with Mendelian inheritance, mutation and environmental noise, when the genetic component of the trait is purely additive. We also show how the model generalises to include epistatic effects. We prove in particular that, within each family, the genetic components of the individual trait values in the current generation are indeed normally distributed with a variance independent of ancestral traits, up to an error of order 1/root M. Simulations suggest that in some cases the convergence may be as fast as 1/M. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Matrix projection models are a central tool in many areas of population biology. In most applications, one starts from the projection matrix to quantify the asymptotic growth rate of the population (the dominant eigenvalue), the stable stage distribution, and the reproductive values (the dominant right and left eigenvectors, respectively). Any primitive projection matrix also has an associated ergodic Markov chain that contains information about the genealogy of the population. In this paper, we show that these facts can be used to specify any matrix population model as a triple consisting of the ergodic Markov matrix, the dominant eigenvalue and one of the corresponding eigenvectors. This decomposition of the projection matrix separates properties associated with lineages from those associated with individuals. It also clarifies the relationships between many quantities commonly used to describe such models, including the relationship between eigenvalue sensitivities and elasticities. We illustrate the utility of such a decomposition by introducing a new method for aggregating classes in a matrix population model to produce a simpler model with a smaller number of classes. Unlike the standard method, our method has the advantage of preserving reproductive values and elasticities. It also has conceptually satisfying properties such as commuting with changes of units.

AB  - Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the main cause of lower respiratory tract infections in children. Whilst highly seasonal, RSV dynamics can have either one-year (annual) or two-year (biennial) cycles. Furthermore, some countries show a 'delayed biennial' pattern, where the epidemic peak in low incidence years is delayed. We develop a compartmental model for RSV infection, driven by a seasonal forcing function, and conduct parameter space and bifurcation analyses to document parameter ranges that give rise to these different seasonal patterns. The model is sensitive to the birth rate, transmission rate, and seasonality parameters, and can replicate RSV dynamics observed in different countries. The seasonality parameter must exceed a threshold for the model to produce biennial cycles. Intermediate values of the birth rate produce the greatest delay in these biennial cycles, while the model reverts to annual cycles if the duration of immunity is too short. Finally, the existence of period doubling and period halving bifurcations suggests robust model dynamics, in agreement with the known regularity of RSV outbreaks. These findings help explain observed RSV data, such as regular biennial dynamics in Western Australia, and delayed biennial dynamics in Finland. From a public health perspective, our findings provide insight into the drivers of RSV transmission, and a foundation for exploring RSV interventions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Theoretical models suggest that competitive coexistence of consumers over shared resources can occur only under very restrictive conditions. Yet, in apparent defiance of the competitive exclusion principle, large numbers of species form natural communities while sharing a small number of limiting resources. Consumers not only coexist, but also show positive facilitative interactions among themselves. Since body size and functional responses may play important roles in these interactions, we investigate their joint effects on two consumers over a single resource. We find that two consumers with unimodal Type IV functional response can facilitate each other by increasing each other's intake rates. But, this facilitation does not necessarily impact their co-existence. When the consumers differ in their body sizes, the larger consumer receives greater absolute benefits, and the smaller consumer gains more relative benefits. These results are consistent with empirical observations, and do not require any additional assumptions over the parameters governing dynamics of resources to explain net positive interactions between consumers.

AB  - We develop a computational framework for addressing pedigree inference problems using small numbers (80-400) of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Our approach relaxes the assumptions, which are commonly made, that sampling is complete with respect to the pedigree and that there is no genotyping error. It relies on representing the inferred pedigree as a factor graph and invoking the Sum-Product algorithm to compute and store quantities that allow the joint probability of the data to be rapidly computed under a large class of rearrangements of the pedigree structure. This allows efficient MCMC sampling over the space of pedigrees, and, hence, Bayesian inference of pedigree structure. In this paper we restrict ourselves to inference of pedigrees without loops using SNPs assumed to be unlinked. We present the methodology in general for multigenerational inference, and we illustrate the method by applying it to the inference of full sibling groups in a large sample (n = 1157) of Chinook salmon typed at 95 SNPs. The results show that our method provides a better point estimate and estimate of uncertainty than the currently best-available maximum-likelihood sibling reconstruction method. Extensions of this work to more complex scenarios are briefly discussed. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The standard model for the dynamics of a fragmented density-dependent population is built from several local logistic models coupled by migrations. First introduced in the 1970s and used in innumerable articles, this standard model applied to a two-patch situation has never been completely analysed. Here, we complete this analysis and we delineate the conditions under which fragmentation associated to dispersal is either beneficial or detrimental to total population abundance. Therefore, this is a contribution to the SLOSS question. Importantly, we also show that, depending on the underlying mechanism, there is no unique way to generalize the logistic model to a patchy situation. In many cases, the standard model is not the correct generalization. We analyse several alternative models and compare their predictions. Finally, we emphasize the shortcomings of the logistic model when written in the r-K parameterization and we explain why Verhulst's original polynomial expression is to be preferred.

AB  - The life table entropy provides useful information for understanding improvements in mortality and survival in a population. In this paper we take a closer look at the life table entropy and use advanced mathematical methods to provide additional insights for understanding how it relates to changes in mortality and survival. By studying the entropy (H) as a functional, we show that changes in the entropy depend on both the relative change in life expectancy lost due to death (e(dagger)) and in life expectancy at birth (e(0)). We also show that changes in the entropy can be further linked to improvements in premature and older deaths. We illustrate our methods with empirical data from Latin American countries, which suggests that at high mortality levels declines in H (which are associated with survival increases) linked with larger improvements in e(0), whereas at low mortality levels e(dagger) made larger contributions to H. We additionally show that among countries with low mortality level, contributions of e(dagger) to changes in the life table entropy resulted from averting early deaths. These findings indicate that future increases in overall survival in low mortality countries will likely result from improvements in e(dagger). (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - In large populations, the distribution of the trajectory of allele frequencies under selection and genetic drift approaches a semi-deterministic behavior: a deterministic trajectory started and ended at stochastic boundary values. This provides simple yet accurate approximations for the distribution of allelic frequencies over time (conditional on fixation), and of extinction and fixation times, for both hard and soft sweeps, and under arbitrary inbreeding and dominance.

AB  - Body size of vertebrate herbivores is strongly linked to other life history traits, most notably (1) tolerance of low quality forage and (2) vulnerability to predation, which both impact the composition and dynamics of natural communities. However, no study has thus far explored how the combination of these two body-size related traits affects the long-term composition and dynamics of the herbivore and plant communities. We made a simple model of ordinary differential equations and simulated a grassland system with three herbivore species (small, medium, large) and two predator species (small, large) to investigate how the combination of low-quality tolerance and predation-vulnerability structure the herbivore and plant community. We found that facilitation and competition between different-sized herbivores and predation by especially small predators stimulate coexistence among herbivore species. Furthermore, the interaction between different-sized herbivores and predators generated cyclical succession in the plant community, i.e. alternating periods of short vegetation dominated by high-quality plants, with periods of tall vegetation dominated by low-quality plants. Our results suggest that cyclical succession in plant communities is more likely to occur when a predator predominantly preys on small herbivore species. Large predators also play an important role, as their addition relaxed the set of conditions under which cyclical succession occurred. Consequently, our model predictions suggest that a diverse predator community plays an important role in the long-term dynamics and maintenance of diversity in both the herbivore and plant community.

AB  - We study how changing female condition during the mating season and condition-dependent search costs impact female mate choice, and what strategies a female could employ in choosing mates to maximize her own fitness. We address this problem via a stochastic dynamic programming model of mate choice. In the model, a female encounters males sequentially and must choose whether to mate or continue searching. As the female searches, her own condition changes stochastically, and she incurs condition-dependent search costs. The female attempts to maximize the quality of the offspring, which is a function of the female's condition at mating and the quality of the male with whom she mates. The mating strategy that maximizes the female's net expected reward is a quality threshold. We compare the optimal policy with other well-known mate choice strategies, and we use simulations to examine how well the optimal policy fares under imperfect information. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Invasive species can have profound effects on a resident community via indirect interactions among community members. While long periodic cycles in population dynamics can make the experimental observation of the indirect effects difficult, modelling the possible effects on an evolutionary tithe scale may provide the much needed information on the potential threats of the invasive species on the ecosystem. Using empirical data from a recent invasion in northernmost Fennoscandia, we applied adaptive dynamics theory and modelled the long term consequences of the invasion by the winter moth into the resident community. Specifically, we investigated the outcome of the observed short-term asymmetric preferences of generalist predators and specialist parasitoids on the long term population dynamics of the invasive winter moth and resident autumnal moth sharing these natural enemies. Our results indicate that coexistence after the invasion is possible. However, the outcome of the indirect interaction on the population dynamics of the moth species was variable and the dynamics might not be persistent on an evolutionary time scale. In addition, the indirect interactions between the two moth species via shared natural enemies were able to cause asynchrony in the population cycles corresponding to field observations from previous sympatric outbreak areas. Therefore, the invasion may cause drastic changes in the resident community, for example by prolonging outbreak periods of birch-feeding moths, increasing the average population densities of the moths or, alternatively, leading to extinction of the resident moth species or to equilibrium densities of the two, formerly cyclic, herbivores.

AB  - Sample n individuals uniformly at random from a population, and then sample m individuals uniformly at random from the sample. Consider the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of the subsample of m individuals. Let the subsample MRCA have j descendants in the sample (m <= j <= n). Under a Moran or coalescent model (and therefore under many other models), the probability that j = n is known. In this case, the subsample MRCA is an ancestor of every sampled individual, and the subsample and sample MRCAs are identical. The probability that j = m is also known. In this case, the subsample MRCA is an ancestor of no sampled individual outside the subsample. This article derives the complete distribution off, enabling inferences from the corresponding p-value. The text presents hypothetical statistical applications pertinent to taxonomy (the gene flow between Neanderthals and anatomically modern humans) and medicine (the association of genetic markers with disease).

AB  - Inheritance of culture is achieved by social learning and improvement is achieved by individual learning. To realize cumulative cultural evolution, social and individual learning should be performed in this order in one's life. However, it is not clear whether such a learning schedule can evolve by the maximization of individual fitness. Here we study optimal allocation of lifetime to learning and exploitation in a two-stage life history model under a constant environment. We show that the learning schedule by which high cultural level is achieved through cumulative cultural evolution is unlikely to evolve as a result of the maximization of individual fitness, if there exists a trade-off between the time spent in learning and the time spent in exploiting the knowledge that has been learned in earlier stages of one's life. Collapse of a fully developed culture is predicted by a game-theoretical analysis where individuals behave selfishly, e.g., less learning and more exploiting. The present study suggests that such factors as group selection, the ability of learning-while-working ("on the job training"), or environmental fluctuation might be important in the realization of rapid and cumulative cultural evolution that is observed in humans.

AB  - The rock-paper-scissors game - which is characterized by three strategies R, P, S, satisfying the non-transitive relations S excludes P, P excludes R, and R excludes S - serves as a simple prototype for studying more complex non-transitive systems. For well-mixed systems where interactions result in fitness reductions of the losers exceeding fitness gains of the winners, classical theory predicts that two strategies go extinct. The effects of spatial heterogeneity and dispersal rates on this outcome are analyzed using a general framework for evolutionary games in patchy landscapes. The analysis reveals that coexistence is determined by the rates at which dominant strategies invade a landscape occupied by the subordinate strategy (e.g. rock invades a landscape occupied by scissors) and the rates at which subordinate strategies get excluded in a landscape occupied by the dominant strategy (e.g. scissors gets excluded in a landscape occupied by rock). These invasion and exclusion rates correspond to eigenvalues of the linearized dynamics near single strategy equilibria. Coexistence occurs when the product of the invasion rates exceeds the product of the exclusion rates. Provided there is sufficient spatial variation in payoffs, the analysis identifies a critical dispersal rate d* required for regional persistence. For dispersal rates below d*, the product of the invasion rates exceeds the product of the exclusion rates and the rock-paper-scissors metacommunities persist regionally despite being extinction prone locally. For dispersal rates above d*, the product of the exclusion rates exceeds the product of the invasion rates and the strategies are extinction prone. These results highlight the delicate interplay between spatial heterogeneity and dispersal in mediating long-term outcomes for evolutionary games. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Aedes vexans and Culex pipiens mosquitoes are potential vectors of many arbovirial diseases. Due to the ongoing climate changes and reappearance of some zoonoses that were considered eradicated, there is a growing concern about potential disease outbreaks. Therefore, the prediction of increased adult population abundances becomes an essential tool for the appropriate implementation of mosquito control strategies. In order to describe the population dynamics of A. vexans and C pipiens mosquitoes in temperate climate regions, a 3-year period (2008-2010) climate-dependent model was constructed. The models represent a combination of mathematical modeling and computer simulations, and include temperature, rainfall, photoperiods, and the flooding dynamics of A. vexans breeding sites. Both models are structured according to the developmental stages, and by individuals' "age" (i.e., time spent in each developmental stage), as we wanted to enable a time delay between the appearances of different developmental stages of mosquitoes. The time delay length is temperature dependent, with temperature being the most important factor influencing morphogenesis rates in immatures and gonotrophic cycle durations in adult mosquitoes. To determine which developmental stages are the most sensitive and are those at which control measures should be aimed, transient elasticities were calculated. The analysis showed that both mosquito species reacted to perturbation of the same matrix elements; however, in the C pipiens model, the stage with greatest proportional sensitivity (i.e., elasticity) during most of the three-year reproduction season contained adults, while in the A. vexans model it contained larvae. The models were validated by comparing 7-day model outputs with data on human bait collection (HBC) obtained from the Public Health Institute of Osijek-Baranja, with both model outputs showing valid compatibility with field data over the three-year period. The proposed models can easily be modified to describe population dynamics of other mosquito species in different geographical areas, as well as for assessing the efficiency and optimization of different mosquito control strategies.

AB  - This study describes a compact method for determining joint probabilities of identity-by-state (IBS) within and between loci in populations evolving under genetic drift, crossing-over, mutation, and regular inbreeding (partial self-fertilization). Analogues of classical indices of associations among loci arise as functions of these joint identities. This coalescence-based analysis indicates that multi-locus associations reflect simultaneous coalescence events across loci. Measures of association depend on genetic diversity rather than allelic frequencies, as do linkage disequilibrium and its relatives. Scaled indices designed to show monotonic dependence on rates of crossing-over, inbreeding, and mutation may prove useful for interpreting patterns of genome-scale variation.

AB  - The introduction of the spatial Lambda-Fleming-Viot model (AV) in population genetics was mainly driven by the pioneering work of Alison Etheridge, in collaboration with Nick Barton and Amandine V & eacute;ber about ten years ago (Barton et al., 2010; Barton et al., 2013). The AV model provides a sound mathematical framework for describing the evolution of a population of related individuals along a spatial continuum. It alleviates the "pain in the torus"issue with Wright and Mal & eacute;cot's isolation by distance model and is sampling consistent, making it a tool of choice for statistical inference. Yet, little is known about the potential connections between the AV and other stochastic processes generating trees and the spatial coordinates along the corresponding lineages. This work focuses on a version of the AV whereby lineages move rapidly over small distances. Using simulations, we show that the induced AV tree-generating process is well approximated by a birth-death model. Our results also indicate that Brownian motions modelling the movements of lines of descent along birth-death trees do not generally provide a good approximation of the AV due to habitat boundaries effects that play an increasingly important role in the long run. Accounting for habitat boundaries through reflected Brownian motions considerably increases the similarity to the AV model however. Finally, we describe efficient algorithms for fast simulation of the backward and forward in time versions of the AV model.

AB  - The diel vertical migration is one of the main drivers of population dynamics in the ocean. Population dynamical models of the ocean typically do not incorporate the behavioral aspects of the migration. We demonstrate a model with coupled population dynamics and behavior with the diel vertical migration emerging. We study the population dynamics and behavioral dynamics of a predator-prey system. We impose a cost of motion for both consumers and prey, and model each individual as following an Ito stochastic differential equation. We study the fixed-points of the ecosystem. Our modeling shows that as we increase the basal resource load, the strength of the diel vertical migration increases, as well as maximal velocity. In addition, a bimodal pattern emerges both for predators and consumers. The increase in the magnitude of the diel vertical migration causes a change in the allocation of copepod resources.

AB  - When we examine the life history of humans against our closest primate relatives, the other great apes, there is notably a greater longevity in humans which includes a distinctive postmenopausal life stage, leading to the question, "How did human females evolve to have old-age infertility?"In their paper "Mate choice and the origin of menopause"(Morton et al., 2013), Morton et al. developed an agentbased model (ABM) to investigate the novel hypothesis that ancestral male mating choices, particularly forgoing mating with older females, were the driving force behind the evolution of menopause. From their model, they concluded that indeed male preference for young female mates could have driven females to lose fertility at older ages through deleterious mutations, leading to menopause. In this work, we revisit their male-mate-choice hypothesis by formulating an analogous mathematical model using a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). We first show that our ODE model recreates the qualitative behaviour and hence conclusions of key scenarios in Morton et al. (2013). However, since our ODE system is less computationally demanding than their ABM, we also conduct a broader sensitivity analysis over a range of parameters and differing initial conditions to analyse the dependence on their conclusions to underlying assumptions. Our results challenge those of Morton et al. as we find that even the slightest deviation from an exclusive mating preference for younger females would counteract the evolution of menopause. Consequently, we propose that their male-mate-choice hypothesis is incomplete and needs further explanation of how a male strategy to exclusively mate with young females could have arisen in our common ancestors and remained evolutionarily stable for long enough to drive the evolution of old-age female infertility.

AB  - Spatial differentiation of phenotypes is assumed to be determined by a combination of fluctuating selection producing adaptations to the local environment and a homogenizing effect of migration. We present a model with density regulation and a density-dependent fitness function affected by spatiotemporal variability in population size driven by spatially correlated fluctuations in the environment causing fluctuating r- and K-selection on a set of traits. We derive the variance in local mean phenotypes and show how the spatial scales of the correlations between the components of the mean phenotype depend on ecological parameters. The degree of spatial differentiation of phenotypes is strongly influenced by parameters affecting ecological dynamics. In the case of a one-dimensional character the geographical scale of variation in the mean phenotype has simply an additive term corresponding to the Moran effect in population dynamics as well as a term determined by dispersal and strength of local selection. The degree of phenotypic differentiation increases with decreasing strength of local density dependence and decreasing strength of local selection. These results imply that the form of the spatial autocorrelation function can reveal important information about ecological and evolutionary processes causing phenotypic differentiation in space.

AB  - Traveling fronts describe the transition between two alternative states in a great number of physical and biological systems. Examples include the spread of beneficial mutations, chemical reactions, and the invasions by foreign species. In homogeneous environments, the alternative states are separated by a smooth front moving at a constant velocity. This simple picture can break down in structured environments such as tissues, patchy landscapes, and microfluidic devices. Habitat fragmentation can pin the front at a particular location or lock invasion velocities into specific values. Locked velocities are not sensitive to moderate changes in dispersal or growth and are determined by the spatial and temporal periodicity of the environment. The synchronization with the environment results in discontinuous fronts that propagate as periodic pulses. We characterize the transition from continuous to locked invasions and show that it is controlled by positive density-dependence in dispersal or growth. We also demonstrate that velocity locking is robust to demographic and environmental fluctuations and examine stochastic dynamics and evolution in locked invasions. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Population genetics models typically consider a fixed population size and a unique selection coefficient. However, population dynamics inherently generate fluctuations in numbers of individuals and selection acts on various components of the individuals' fitness. In plant species with seed banks, the size of both the above- and below-ground compartments induce fluctuations depending on seed production and the state of the seed bank. We investigate if this fluctuation has consequences on (1) the rate of genetic drift, and (2) the efficacy of selection. We consider four variants of two-allele Moran-type models defined by combinations of presence and absence of fluctuations in the population size in above-ground and seed bank compartments. Time scale analysis and dimension reduction methods allow us to reduce the corresponding Fokker-Planck equations to one-dimensional diffusion approximations of a Moran model. We first show that if the fluctuations of above-ground population size classically affect the rate of genetic drift, fluctuations of below-ground population size reduce the diversity storage effect of the seed bank. Second, we consider that selection can act on four different components of the plant fitness: plant or seed death rate, seed production or seed germination. Our striking result is that the efficacy of selection for seed death rate or germination rate is reduced by fluctuations in the seed bank size, whereas selection occurring on plant death rate or seed production is not affected. We derive the expected site-frequency spectrum reflecting this heterogeneity in selection efficacy between genes underpinning different plant fitness components. Our results highlight the importance to consider the effect of ecological noise to predict the impact of seed banks on neutral and selective evolution. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - In Beisel et al. (2007), a likelihood framework, based on extreme value theory (EVT), was developed for determining the distribution of fitness effects for adaptive mutations. In this paper we extend this framework beyond the extreme distributions and develop a likelihood framework for testing whether or not extreme value theory applies. By making two simple adjustments to the Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD) we introduce a new simple five parameter probability density function that incorporates nearly every common (continuous) probability model ever used. This means that all of the common models are nested. This has important implications in model selection beyond determining the distribution of fitness effects. However, we demonstrate the use of this distribution utilizing likelihood ratio testing to evaluate alternative distributions to the Gumbel and Weibull domains of attraction of fitness effects. We use a bootstrap strategy, utilizing importance sampling, to determine where in the parameter space will the test be most powerful in detecting deviations from these domains and at what sample size, with focus on small sample sizes (n < 20). Our results indicate that the likelihood ratio test is most powerful in detecting deviation from the Gumbel domain when the shape parameters of the model are small while the test is more powerful in detecting deviations from the Weibull domain when these parameters are large. As expected, an increase in sample size improves the power of the test. This improvement is observed to occur quickly with sample size n >= 10 in tests related to the Gumbel domain and n >= 15 in the case of the Weibull domain.

AB  - A population genetics model based on a multitype branching process, or equivalently a Galton-Watson branching process for multiple alleles, is presented. The diffusion limit forward Kolmogorov equation is derived for the case of neutral mutations. The asymptotic stationary solution is obtained and has the property that the extant population partitions into subpopulations whose relative sizes are determined by mutation rates. An approximate time-dependent solution is obtained in the limit of low mutation rates. This solution has the property that the system undergoes a rapid transition from a drift-dominated phase to a mutation-dominated phase in which the distribution collapses onto the asymptotic stationary distribution. The changeover point of the transition is determined by the per-generation growth factor and mutation rate. The approximate solution is confirmed using numerical simulations. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - For the seedbank coalescent with mutation under the infinite alleles assumption, which describes the gene genealogy of a population with a strong seedbank effect subject to mutations, we study the distribution of the final partition with mutation. This generalizes the coalescent with freeze by Dong et al. (2007) to coalescents where ancestral lineages are blocked from coalescing. We derive an implicit recursion which we show to have a unique solution and give an interpretation in terms of absorption problems of a random walk. Moreover, we derive recursions for the distribution of the number of blocks in the final partition. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - We study a variant of Hanski's incidence function model that allows habitat patch characteristics to vary over time following a Markov process. The widely studied case where patches are classified as either suitable or unsuitable is included as a special case. For large metapopulations, we determine a recursion for the probability that a given habitat patch is occupied. This recursion enables us to clarify the role of landscape dynamics in the survival of a metapopulation. In particular, we show that landscape dynamics affects the persistence and equilibrium level of the metapopulation primarily through its effect on the distribution of a local population's life span.

AB  - A new probabilistic model of aging that can be applied to organisms is suggested and analyzed. Organisms are subject to shocks that follow the generalized Polya process (GPP), which has been recently introduced and characterized in the literature. Distinct from the nonhomogeneous Poisson process that has been widely used in applications, the important feature of this process is the dependence of its future behavior on the number of previous events (shocks). The corresponding survival and the mortality rate functions are derived and analyzed. The general approach is used for justification of the Gompertz law of human mortality. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - There has been recent interest in the exploitation of readily available dense genome scan marker data for the identification of relatives. However, there are conflicting findings on how informative these data are in practical situations and, in particular, sets of thinned markers are often used with no concrete justification for the chosen spacing. We explore the potential usefulness of dense single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays for this application with a focus on inferring distant relative pairs. We distinguish between relationship estimation, as defined by a pedigree connecting the two individuals of interest, and estimation of general relatedness as would be provided by a kinship coefficient or a coefficient of relatedness. Since our primary interest is in the former case, we adopt a pedigree likelihood approach. We consider the effect of additional SNPs and data on an additional typed relative, together with choice of that relative, on relationship inference. We also consider the effect of linkage disequilibrium. When overall relatedness, rather than the specific relationship, would suffice, we propose an approximate approach that is easy to implement and appears to compete well with a popular moment-based estimator and a recent maximum likelihood approach based on chromosomal sharing. We conclude that denser marker data are more informative for distant relatives. However, linkage disequilibrium cannot be ignored and will be the main limiting factor for applications to real data.

AB  - Species trees represent the historical divergences of populations or species, while gene trees trace the ancestry of individual gene copies sampled within those populations. In cases involving rapid speciation, gene trees with topologies that differ from that of the species tree can be most probable under the standard multispecies coalescent model, making species tree inference more difficult. Such anomalous gene trees are not well understood except for some small cases. In this work, we establish one constraint that applies to trees of any size: gene trees with "caterpillar" topologies cannot be anomalous. The proof of this involves. a new combinatorial object, called a population history, which keeps track of the number of coalescent events in each ancestral population. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - As researchers collect spatiotemporal population and genetic data in tandem, models that connect demography and dispersal to genetics are increasingly relevant. The dominant spatiotemporal model of invasion genetics is the stepping-stone model which represents a gradual range expansion in which individuals jump to uncolonized locations one step at a time. However, many range expansions occur quickly as individuals disperse far from currently colonized regions. For these types of expansion, stepping-stone models are inappropriate. To more accurately reflect wider dispersal in many organisms, we created kernel-based models of invasion genetics based on integrodifference equations. Classic theory relating to integrodifference equations suggests that the speed of range expansions is a function of population growth and dispersal. In our simulations, populations that expanded at the same speed but with spread rates driven by dispersal retained more heterozygosity along axes of expansion than range expansions with rates of spread that were driven primarily by population growth. To investigate surfing we introduced mutant alleles in wave fronts of simulated range expansions. In our models based on random mating, surfing alleles remained at relatively low frequencies and surfed less often compared to previous results based on stepping-stone simulations with asexual reproduction.

AB  - A long genomic segment inherited by a pair of individuals from a single, recent common ancestor is said to be identical-by-descent (IBD). Shared IBD segments have numerous applications in genetics, from demographic inference to phasing, imputation, pedigree reconstruction, and disease mapping. Here, we provide a theoretical analysis of IBD sharing under Markovian approximations of the coalescent with recombination. We describe a general framework for the IBD process along the chromosome under the Markovian models (SMC/SMC'), as well as introduce and justify a new model, which we term the renewal approximation, under which lengths of successive segments are independent. Then, considering the infinite-chromosome limit of the IBD process, we recover previous results (for SMC) and derive new results (for SMC') for the mean number of shared segments longer than a cutoff and the fraction of the chromosome found in such segments. We then use renewal theory to derive an expression (in Laplace space) for the distribution of the number of shared segments and demonstrate implications for demographic inference. We also compute (again, in Laplace space) the distribution of the fraction of the chromosome in shared segments, from which we obtain explicit expressions for the first two moments. Finally, we generalize all results to populations with a variable effective size. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Animals can often coordinate their actions to achieve mutually beneficial outcomes. However, this can result in a social dilemma when uncertainty about the behavior of partners creates multiple fitness peaks. Strategies that minimize risk ("risk dominant") instead of maximizing reward ("payoff dominant") are favored in economic models when individuals learn behaviors that increase their payoffs. Specifically, such strategies are shown to be "stochastically stable" (a refinement of evolutionary stability).
   Here, we extend the notion of stochastic stability to biological models of continuous phenotypes at a mutation-selection-drift balance. This allows us to make a unique prediction for long-term evolution in games with multiple equilibria. We show how genetic relatedness due to limited dispersal and scaled to account for local competition can crucially affect the stochastically-stable outcome of coordination games. We find that positive relatedness (weak local competition) increases the chance the payoff dominant strategy is stochastically stable, even when it is not risk dominant. Conversely, negative relatedness (strong local competition) increases the chance that strategies evolve that are neither payoff nor risk dominant. Extending our results to large multiplayer coordination games we find that negative relatedness can create competition so extreme that the game effectively changes to a hawk-dove game and a stochastically stable polymorphism between the alternative strategies evolves. These results demonstrate the usefulness of stochastic stability in characterizing long-term evolution of continuous phenotypes: the outcomes of multiplayer games can be reduced to the generic equilibria of two-player games and the effect of spatial structure can be analyzed readily.

AB  - The most common models of sequence evolution used to make inferences about adaptation rely on the assumption that selective pressures at a site remain constant through time. Instead, one might plausibly imagine that a change in the environment renders an allele beneficial and that when it fixes, the site is now constrained-until another change in the environment occurs that affects the selective pressures at that site. With this view in mind, we introduce a simple dynamic model for the evolution of coding regions, in which non-synonymous sites alternate between being fixed for the favored allele and being neutral with respect to other alleles. We use the pruning algorithm to derive closed forms for observable patterns of polymorphism and divergence in terms of the model parameters. Using our model, estimates of the fraction of beneficial substitutions alpha would remain similar to those obtained from existing approaches. In this framework, however, it becomes natural to ask how often adaptive substitutions originate from previously constrained or previously neutral sites, i.e., about the source of adaptive substitutions. We show that counts of coding sites that are both polymorphic in a sample from one species and divergent between two others carry information about this parameter. We also extend the basic model to include the effects of weakly deleterious mutations and discuss the importance of assumptions about the distribution of deleterious mutations among constrained non-synonymous sites. Finally, we derive a likelihood function for the parameters and apply it to a toy example, variation data for coding regions from chromosome 2 of the Drosophila melanogaster subgroup. This modeling work underscores how restrictive assumptions about adaptation have been to date, and how further work in this area will help to reveal unexplored and yet basic characteristics of adaptation.

AB  - We introduce a modified spatial Lambda-Fleming-Viot process to model the ancestry of individuals in a population occupying a continuous spatial habitat divided into two areas by a sharp discontinuity of the dispersal rate and effective population density. We derive an analytical formula for the expected number of shared haplotype segments between two individuals depending on their sampling locations. This formula involves the transition density of a skew diffusion which appears as a scaling limit of the ancestral lineages of individuals in this model. We then show that this formula can be used to infer the dispersal parameters and the effective population density of both regions, using a composite likelihood approach, and we demonstrate the efficiency of this method on a range of simulated data sets.

AB  - We introduce a multi-allele Wright-Fisher model with mutation and selection such that allele frequencies at a single locus are traced by the path of a hybrid jump-diffusion process. The state space of the process is given by the vertices and edges of a topological graph, i.e. edges are unit intervals. Vertices represent monomorphic population states and positions on the edges mark the biallelic proportions of ancestral and derived alleles during polymorphic segments. In this setting, mutations can only occur at monomorphic loci. We derive the stationary distribution in mutation-selection-drift equilibrium and obtain the expected allele frequency spectrum under large population size scaling. For the extended model with multiple independent loci we derive rigorous upper bounds for a wide class of associated measures of genetic variation. Within this framework we present mathematically precise arguments to conclude that the presence of directional selection reduces the magnitude of genetic variation, as constrained by the bounds for neutral evolution.

AB  - The coalescent is a stochastic process representing ancestral lineages in a population undergoing neutral genetic drift. Originally defined for a well-mixed population, the coalescent has been adapted in various ways to accommodate spatial, age, and class structure, along with other features of real-world populations. To further extend the range of population structures to which coalescent theory applies, we formulate a coalescent process for a broad class of neutral drift models with arbitrary - but fixed - spatial, age, sex, and class structure, haploid or diploid genetics, and any fixed mating pattern. Here, the coalescent is represented as a random sequence of mappings C = (C-t)(t = 0)(infinity) from a finite set G to itself. The set G represents the "sites"(in individuals, in particular locations and/or classes) at which these alleles can live. The state of the coalescent, C-t : G -> G maps each site g is an element of G to the site containing g's ancestor, t time-steps into the past. Using this representation, we define and analyze coalescence time, coalescence branch length, mutations prior to coalescence, and stationary probabilities of identity-by-descent and identity-by-state. For low mutation, we provide a recipe for computing identity-by-descent and identity-by-state probabilities via the coalescent. Applying our results to a diploid population with arbitrary sex ratio r , we find that measures of genetic dissimilarity, among any set of sites, are scaled by 4r(1 - r) relative to the even sex ratio case.

AB  - We study the response of a quantitative trait to exponential directional selection in a finite haploid population, both at the genetic and the phenotypic level. We assume an infinite sites model, in which the number of new mutations per generation in the population follows a Poisson distribution (with mean Theta) and each mutation occurs at a new, previously monomorphic site. Mutation effects are beneficial and drawn from a distribution. Sites are unlinked and contribute additively to the trait. Assuming that selection is stronger than random genetic drift, we model the initial phase of the dynamics by a supercritical Galton-Watson process. This enables us to obtain time-dependent results. We show that the copy-number distribution of the mutant in generation n, conditioned on non-extinction until n, is described accurately by the deterministic increase from an initial distribution with mean 1. This distribution is related to the absolutely continuous part W+ of the random variable, typically denoted W, that characterizes the stochasticity accumulating during the mutant's sweep. A suitable transformation yields the approximate dynamics of the mutant frequency distribution in a Wright-Fisher population of size N. Our expression provides a very accurate approximation except when mutant frequencies are close to 1. On this basis, we derive explicitly the (approximate) time dependence of the expected mean and variance of the trait and of the expected number of segregating sites. Unexpectedly, we obtain highly accurate approximations for all times, even for the quasi-stationary phase when the expected per-generation response and the trait variance have equilibrated. The latter refine classical results. In addition, we find that Theta is the main determinant of the pattern of adaptation at the genetic level, i.e., whether the initial allele-frequency dynamics are best described by sweep-like patterns at few loci or small allele-frequency shifts at many. The number of segregating sites is an appropriate indicator for these patterns. The selection strength determines primarily the rate of adaptation. The accuracy of our results is tested by comprehensive simulations in a Wright-Fisher framework. We argue that our results apply to more complex forms of directional selection.

AB  - Natural selection acts on phenotypes constructed over development, which raises the question of how development affects evolution. Classic evolutionary theory indicates that development affects evolution by modulating the genetic covariation upon which selection acts, thus affecting genetic constraints. However, whether genetic constraints are relative, thus diverting adaptation from the direction of steepest fitness ascent, or absolute, thus blocking adaptation in certain directions, remains uncertain. This limits understanding of long-term evolution of developmentally constructed phenotypes. Here we formulate a general, tractable mathematical framework that integrates age progression, explicit development (i.e., the construction of the phenotype across life subject to developmental constraints), and evolutionary dynamics, thus describing the evolutionary and developmental (evo-devo) dynamics. The framework yields simple equations that can be arranged in a layered structure that we call the evo-devo process, whereby five core elementary components generate all equations including those mechanistically describing genetic covariation and the evo-devo dynamics. The framework recovers evolutionary dynamic equations in gradient form and describes the evolution of genetic covariation from the evolution of genotype, phenotype, environment, and mutational covariation. This shows that genotypic and phenotypic evolution must be followed simultaneously to yield a dynamically sufficient description of long-term phenotypic evolution in gradient form, such that evolution described as the climbing of a fitness landscape occurs in "geno-phenotype"space. Genetic constraints in geno-phenotype space are necessarily absolute because the phenotype is related to the genotype by development. Thus, the long-term evolutionary dynamics of developed phenotypes is strongly non-standard: (1) evolutionary equilibria are either absent or infinite in number and depend on genetic covariation and hence on development; (2) developmental constraints determine the admissible evolutionary path and hence which evolutionary equilibria are admissible; and (3) evolutionary outcomes occur at admissible evolutionary equilibria, which do not generally occur at fitness landscape peaks in geno-phenotype space, but at peaks in the admissible evolutionary path where "total genotypic selection"vanishes if exogenous plastic response vanishes and mutational variation exists in all directions of genotype space. Hence, selection and development jointly define the evolutionary outcomes if absolute mutational constraints and exogenous plastic response are absent, rather than the outcomes being defined only by selection. Moreover, our framework provides formulas for the sensitivities of a recurrence and an alternative method to dynamic optimization (i.e., dynamic programming or optimal control) to identify evolutionary outcomes in models with developmentally dynamic traits. These results show that development has major evolutionary effects.

AB  - Principal component analysis (PCA) is one of the most frequently-used approach to describe population structure from multilocus genotype data. Regarding geographic range expansions of modern humans, interpretations of PCA have, however, been questioned, as there is uncertainty about the wave-like patterns that have been observed in principal components. It has indeed been argued that wave-like patterns are mathematical artifacts that arise generally when PCA is applied to data in which genetic differentiation increases with geographic distance. Here, we present an alternative theory for the observation of wave-like patterns in PCA. We study a coalescent model - the umbrella model - for the diffusion of genetic variants. The model is based on genetic drift without any particular geographical structure. In the umbrella model, splits from an ancestral population occur almost continuously in time, giving birth to small daughter populations at a regular pace. Our results provide detailed mathematical descriptions of eigenvalues and eigenvectors for the PCA of sampled genomic sequences under the model. When variants uniquely represented in the sample are removed, the PCA eigenvectors are defined as cosine functions of increasing periodicity, reproducing wave-like patterns observed in equilibrium isolation-by-distance models. Including singleton variants in the analysis, the eigenvectors corresponding to the largest eigenvalues exhibit complex wave shapes. The accuracy of our predictions is further investigated with coalescent simulations. Our analysis supports the hypothesis that highly structured wave-like patterns could arise from genetic drift only, and may not always be artificial outcomes of spatially structured data. Genomic data related to the peopling of the Americas are reanalyzed in the light of our new theory. (c) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - This paper considers predator-prey systems in which the predator moves between two patches. One patch is a source, where the predator and prey can persist, while the other is a sink where the predator cannot survive. Our aim is to show whether or not the dispersal is beneficial to the predator's total abundance at equilibrium. Using dynamical systems theory, we demonstrate conditions under which a dispersing predator can persist. Our analysis shows that the predator equilibrium abundance at intermediate dispersal rates can be higher than that without dispersal, while extremely large or small dispersal rates could result in predator's extinction. Moreover, we find an explicit expression for the total abundance, which clearly shows the role of dispersal rates and asymmetry on the predator's abundance. Numerical simulations confirm and extend our results. (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Quantitative fishery harvest strategies in many countries throughout the world are based on maximum sustainable yield (MSY) reference points (RPs); in particular, the fishing mortality rate that produces MSY (i.e. F-msy) and the population biomass (B-msy) that results from fishing at F-msy. There is often great interest in the sensitivity of MSY RPs to their inputs and underlying assumptions. We perturb (i.e. omega) inputs to generate influence curves which we denote as F-msy(omega) and By(omega) as functions of omega. We derive diagnostic equations for the slopes of F-msy(omega) and B-msy(omega) at the origin (i.e. no perturbation). These equations provide a conceptual understanding of how F-msy and B-msy will change in response to changes in inputs, which one does not get from a simple computational sensitivity analysis. We show that a leading factor determining the sensitivity of F-msy is the amount of curvature in the equilibrium yield curve near F-msy. Another leading factor affecting the sensitivity of B-msy is if the stock recruitment function indicates low density-dependence in recruitment productivity. With some exceptions, we find that F-msy will increase if the body growth rate or asymptotic size increases, 2) proportions mature increase at younger ages, and 3) natural mortality rates decrease and the Ricker stock recruitment function is used. If the fishery selectivity function of age is monotone increasing then F-msy will also usually increase if peak selectivity is shifted to an older age. Usually the signs of the slopes for B-msy and F-msy are the same. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Species exhibit large diversity in their seasonal metabolic patterns which are traditionally explained by habitat specific seasonal temperature changes and various thermoregulatory adaptations. However, due to seasonal changes in resource abundances, density-dependent, ecological processes can also be important selective forces shaping the evolution of metabolic patterns. In the present theoretical study, the combined effect of environmental temperature and resource availability on the evolutionarily stable metabolic strategies is investigated in a consumer-resource model. Our results suggest that, under a broad range of circumstances, density-dependent mechanisms favor the selection of active metabolic regulation, where the metabolic rate differs from the thermally optimal value. This effect may be temporary, limited only to a brief period at seasonal changes, or permanent depending on the implied energetic cost and the relative timescale of environmental changes as compared to the generation time.

AB  - Many mathematical frameworks of evolutionary game dynamics assume that the total population size is constant and that selection affects only the relative frequency of strategies. Here, we consider evolutionary game dynamics in an extended Wright-Fisher process with variable population size. In such a scenario, it is possible that the entire population becomes extinct. Survival of the population may depend on which strategy prevails in the game dynamics. Studying cooperative dilemmas, it is a natural feature of such a model that cooperators enable survival, while defectors drive extinction. Although defectors are favored for any mixed population, random drift could lead to their elimination and the resulting pure-cooperator population could survive. On the other hand, if the defectors remain, then the population will quickly go extinct because the frequency of cooperators steadily declines and defectors alone cannot survive. In a mutation-selection model, we find that (i) a steady supply of cooperators can enable long-term population survival, provided selection is sufficiently strong, and (ii) selection can increase the abundance of cooperators but reduce their relative frequency. Thus, evolutionary game dynamics in populations with variable size generate a multifaceted notion of what constitutes a trait's long-term success. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The question as to why most complex organisms reproduce sexually remains a very active research area in evolutionary biology. Theories dating back to Weismann have suggested that the key may lie in the creation of increased variability in offspring, causing enhanced response to selection. Under appropriate conditions, selection is known to result in the generation of negative linkage disequilibrium, with the effect of recombination then being to increase genetic variance by reducing these negative associations between alleles. It has therefore been a matter of significant interest to understand precisely those conditions resulting in negative linkage disequilibrium, and to recognise also the conditions in which the corresponding increase in genetic variation will be advantageous. Here, we prove rigorous results for the multi-locus case, detailing the build up of negative linkage disequilibrium, and describing the long term effect on population fitness for models with and without bounds on fitness contributions from individual alleles. Under the assumption of large but finite bounds on fitness contributions from alleles, the non-linear nature of the effect of recombination on a population presents serious obstacles in finding the genetic composition of populations at equilibrium, and in establishing convergence to those equilibria. We describe techniques for analysing the long term behaviour of sexual and asexual populations for such models, and use these techniques to establish conditions resulting in higher fitnesses for sexually reproducing populations.

AB  - Briggs et al. (1993) introduced a host-parasitoid model for the dynamics of a system with two parasitoids that attack different juvenile stages of a common host. Their main result was that coexistence of the parasitoids is only possible when there is sufficient variability in the maturation delays of the host juvenile stages. Here, we analyze the phenomenon of coexistence in that model more deeply. We show that with some distribution families for the maturation delays, the coexistence equilibrium is unique, while with other distributions multiple coexistence equilibria can be found. In particular, we find that stable coexistence does not necessarily require mutual invasibility. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - An epidemic model with births and deaths is considered on a two-dimensional L xL lattice. Each individual can have global infective contacts according to the standard susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model rules or local infective contacts with their nearest neighbors. We propose a deterministic approach to this model and, for the parameters corresponding to pertussis and rubella in the prevaccine era, verify that there is a close agreement with the stochastic simulations when epidemic spread or endemic stationarity is considered. We also find that our approach captures the characteristic features of the dynamic behavior of the system after a sudden decrease in global contacts that may arise as a consequence of health care measures. By using the deterministic approach, we are able to characterize the exponential growth of the epidemic behavior and analyze the stability of the system at the stationary values. Since the deterministic approximation captures the essential features of the disease transmission dynamics of the stochastic model, it provides a useful tool for performing systematic studies as a function of the model parameters. We give an example of this potentiality by analyzing the likelihood of the endemic state to become extinct when the weight of the global contacts is drastically reduced. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The paper by Ewens and Lessard (2015) adds to the progress that has been made in exploring the discrete generation analytical version of Fisher's Fundamental Theorem of Natural Selection introduced by Ewens (1989). Fisher's continuous-time theorem differs from the version described by Ewens and Lessard by using a different concept of fitness. Ewens and Lessard use the conventional 'viability' concept whereas for Fisher the fitness of a genotype was its relative rate of increase or decrease in the population. The sole purpose of the present paper is to emphasize the alternative inductive nature of Fisher's theorem, as presented by him in 1930, by placing it in the context of his contemporary development of the analysis of variance in agricultural experiments. It is not a general discussion of the theorem itself. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The variance effective population size for age structured populations is generally hard to estimate and the temporal method often gives biased estimates. Here, we give an explicit expression for a correction factor which, combined with estimates from the temporal method, yield approximately unbiased estimates. The calculation of the correction factor requires knowledge of the age specific offspring distribution and survival probabilities as well as possible correlation between survival and reproductive success. In order to relax these requirements, we show that only first order moments of these distributions need to be known if the time between samples is large, or individuals from all age classes which reproduce are sampled. A very explicit approximate expression for the asymptotic coefficient of standard deviation of the estimator is derived, and it can be used to construct confidence intervals and optimal ways of weighting information from different markers. The asymptotic coefficient of standard deviation can also be used to design studies and we show that in order to maximize the precision for a given sample size, individuals from older age classes should be sampled since their expected variance of allele frequency change is higher and easier to estimate. However, for populations with fluctuating age class sizes, the accuracy of the method is reduced when samples are taken from older age classes with high demographic variation. We also present a method for simultaneous estimation of the variance effective and census population size. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) methods perform inference on model-specific parameters of mechanistically motivated parametric models when evaluating likelihoods is difficult. Central to the success of ABC methods, which have been used frequently in biology, is computationally inexpensive simulation of data sets from the parametric model of interest. However, when simulating data sets from a model is so computationally expensive that the posterior distribution of parameters cannot be adequately sampled by ABC, inference is not straightforward. We present "approximate approximate Bayesian computation" (AABC), a class of computationally fast inference methods that extends ABC to models in which simulating data is expensive. In AABC, we first simulate a number of data sets small enough to be computationally feasible to simulate from the parametric model. Conditional on these data sets, we use a statistical model that approximates the correct parametric model and enables efficient simulation of a large number of data sets. We show that under mild assumptions, the posterior distribution obtained by AABC converges to the posterior distribution obtained by ABC, as the number of data sets simulated from the parametric model and the sample size of the observed data set increase. We demonstrate the performance of AABC on a population-genetic model of natural selection, as well as on a model of the admixture history of hybrid populations. This latter example illustrates how, in population genetics, AABC is of particular utility in scenarios that rely on conceptually straightforward but potentially slow forward-in-time simulations.

AB  - Many species have an essentially continuous distribution in space, in which there are no natural divisions between randomly mating subpopulations. Yet, the standard approach to modelling these populations is to impose an arbitrary grid of demes, adjusting deme sizes and migration rates in an attempt to capture the important features of the population. Such indirect methods are required because of the failure of the classical models of isolation by distance, which have been shown to have major technical flaws. A recently introduced model of extinction and recolonisation in two dimensions solves these technical problems, and provides a rigorous technical foundation for the study of populations evolving in a spatial continuum. The coalescent process for this model is simply stated, but direct simulation is very inefficient for large neighbourhood sizes. We present efficient and exact algorithms to simulate this coalescent process for arbitrary sample sizes and numbers of loci, and analyse these algorithms in detail. (C) 2014 The Authors.

AB  - A likelihood method is introduced that jointly estimates the number of loci and the additive effect of alleles that account for the genetic variance of a normally distributed quantitative character in a randomly mating population. The method assumes that measurements of the character are available from one or both parents and an arbitrary number of full siblings. The method uses the fact, first recognized by Karl Pearson in 1904, that the variance of a character among offspring depends on both the parental phenotypes and on the number of loci. Simulations show that the method performs well provided that data from a sufficient number of families (on the order of thousands) are available. This method assumes that the loci are in Hardy-Weinberg and linkage equilibrium but does not assume anything about the linkage relationships. It performs equally well if all loci are on the same non-recombining chromosome provided they are in linkage equilibrium. The method can be adapted to take account of loci already identified as being associated with the "character of interest. In that case, the method estimates the number of loci not already known to affect the character. The method applied to measurements of crown-rump length in 281 family trios in a captive colony of African green monkeys (Chlorocebus aethiopus sabaeus) estimates the number of loci to be 112 and the additive effect to be 0.26 cm. A parametric bootstrap analysis shows that a rough confidence interval has a lower bound of 14 loci. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Evolutionary dynamics and patterns of molecular evolution are strongly influenced by selection on linked regions of the genome, but our quantitative understanding of these effects remains incomplete. Recent work has focused on predicting the distribution of fitness within an evolving population, and this forms the basis for several methods that leverage the fitness distribution to predict the patterns of genetic diversity when selection is strong. However, in weakly selected populations random fluctuations due to genetic drift are more severe, and neither the distribution of fitness nor the sequence diversity within the population are well understood. Here, we briefly review the motivations behind the fitness-distribution picture, and summarize the general approaches that have been used to analyze this distribution in the strong-selection regime. We then extend these approaches to the case of weak selection, by outlining a perturbative treatment of selection at a large number of linked sites. This allows us to quantify the stochastic behavior of the fitness distribution and yields exact analytical predictions for the sequence diversity and substitution rate in the limit that selection is weak.

AB  - Partial migration is a widespread phenomenon characterized by migrant and resident forms from the same population. In phenotypically plastic taxa with indeterminate growth, resident and migrant ecophenotypes can differ in size and life history traits in ways expected to maximize fitness in the different habitats they exploit. Studies of partial migration in different taxa have advocated either density-dependence or environmental stochasticity as explanations for partial migration. We used a demographic approach for a virtual Brook Trout population to demonstrate the ecological consequences of partial migration under interacting density dependence and environmental stochasticity. The maintenance of partial migration as a conditional strategy in species/populations where resident and migrant forms exhibit life history asymmetries provides ecological advantages. We show that density-dependent migration is expected to increase population fitness under constant environmental conditions or low environmental variation, but decreases population fitness under high environmental variation. These conditions favor intermediate levels of migration a an advantageous tactic. However, there are threshold rates of return migration below which partial migration is no longer a viable tactic. Our modeling approach also allowed the exploration of the distribution of the population by life stage and habitat in response to the strength of density dependence, costs of migration, and return rates, and demonstrated the importance of the conservation of ecophenotypes in partially migratory populations.

AB  - Leveraging the simplicity of nucleotide mismatch distributions, we provide an intuitive window into the evolution of the human influenza A 'nonstructural' (NS) gene segment. In an analysis suggested by the eminent Danish biologist Freddy B. Christiansen, we illustrate the existence of a continuous genetic "backbone"of influenza A NS sequences, steadily increasing in nucleotide distance to the 1918 root over more than a century. The 2009 influenza A/H1N1 pandemic represents a clear departure from this enduring genetic backbone. Utilizing nucleotide distance maps and phylogenetic analyses, we illustrate remaining uncertainties regarding the origin of the 2009 pandemic, highlighting the complexity of influenza evolution. The NS segment is interesting precisely because it experiences less pervasive positive selection, and departs less strongly from neutral evolution than e.g. the HA antigen. Consequently, sudden deviations from neutral diversification can indicate changes in other genes via the hitchhiking effect. Our approach employs two measures based on nucleotide mismatch counts to analyze the evolutionary dynamics of the NS gene segment. The rooted Hamming map of distances between a reference sequence and all other sequences over time, and the unrooted temporal Hamming distribution which captures the distribution of genotypic distances between simultaneously circulating viruses, thereby revealing patterns of nucleotide diversity and epi-evolutionary dynamics.

AB  - Cell division is a necessity of life which can be either mitotic or amitotic. While both are fundamental, amitosis is sometimes considered a relic of little importance in biology. Nevertheless, eukaryotes often have polyploid cells, including cancer cells, which may divide amitotically. To understand how amitosis ensures the completion of cell division, we turn to the macronuclei of ciliates. The grand scheme governing the proliferation of the macronuclei of ciliate cells, which involves chromosomal replication and amitosis, is currently unknown, which is crucial for developing population genetics model of ciliate populations. Using a novel model that encompasses a wide range of mechanisms together with experimental data of the composition of mating types at different stages derived from a single karyonide of Tetrahymena thermophila , we show that the chromosomal replication of the macronucleus has a strong head-start effect, with only about five copies of chromosomes replicated at a time and persistent reuse of the chromosomes involved in the early replication. Furthermore the fission of a fully grown macronucleus is non-random with regard to chromosome composition, with a strong tendency to push chromosomes and their replications to the same daughter cell.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - We analyze evolutionary dynamics in a confluent, branching cellular population, such as in a growing duct, vasculature, or in a branching microbial colony. We focus on the coarse-grained features of the evolution and build a statistical model that captures the essential features of the dynamics. Using simulations and analytic approaches, we show that the survival probability of strains within the growing population is sensitive to the branching geometry: Branch bifurcations enhance survival probability due to an overall population growth (i.e., "inflation "), while branch termination and the small effective population size at the growing branch tips increase the probability of strain extinction. We show that the evolutionary dynamics may be captured on a wide range of branch geometries parameterized just by the branch diameter N0 and branching rate b. We find that the survival probability of neutral cell strains is largest at an "optimal " branching rate, which balances the effects of inflation and branch termination. We find that increasing the selective advantage s of the cell strain mitigates the inflationary effect by decreasing the average time at which the mutant cell fate is determined. For sufficiently large selective advantages, the survival probability of the advantageous mutant decreases monotonically with the branching rate. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - One way to reduce the impacts of invading wildlife diseases is setting up fences that would reduce the spread of pathogens by limiting connectivity, similarly to exclusion fences that are commonly used to conserve threatened species against invasive predators. One of the problems with fences is that, while they may have the short-term benefit of impeding the spread of disease, this benefit may be offset by potential long-term ecological costs of fragmentation by fencing. However, managers facing situations where a pathogen has been detected near the habitat of a (highly) vulnerable species may be willing to explore such a trade-off. To aid such exploration quantitatively, we present a series of models trading off the benefits of fragmentation (potential reduction of disease impacts on susceptible individuals) against its costs (both financial and ecological, i.e. reduced viability in the patches created by fragmentation), and exploring the effects of fragmentation on non-target species richness. For all model variants we derive the optimal number of artificial patches. We show that pre-emptive disease fences may have benefits when the risk of disease exceeds the impacts of fragmentation, when fence failure rates are lower than a specific threshold, and when sufficient resources are available to implement optimal solutions. A useful step to initiate planning is to obtain information about the expected number of initial infection events and on the host's extinction threshold with respect to the focal habitat and management duration. Our approach can assist managers to identify whether the trade-offs support the decision to fence and how intensive fragmentation should be. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The ancestral recombination graph (ARG) contains the full genealogical information of the sample, and many population genetic inference problems can be solved using inferred or sampled ARGs. In particular, the waiting distance between tree changes along the genome can be used to make inference about the distribution and evolution of recombination rates. To this end, we here derive an analytic expression for the distribution of waiting distances between tree changes under the sequentially Markovian coalescent model and obtain an accurate approximation to the distribution of waiting distances for topology changes. We use these results to show that some of the recently proposed methods for inferring sequences of trees along the genome provide strongly biased distributions of waiting distances. In addition, we provide a correction to an undercounting problem facing all available ARG inference methods, thereby facilitating the use of ARG inference methods to estimate temporal changes in the recombination rate.

AB  - Sexual selection and divergent selection are among the major driving forces of reproductive isolation, which could eventually result in speciation. A magic trait is defined such that a single trait is subject to both divergent selection and mate choice through phenotype-based assortative mating. We are here interested in the evolutionary behavior of alleles at a genetic locus responsible for a magic trait in a finite population. We assume that, in a pair of homogeneous subpopulations, a mutant allele arises at the magic trait locus, and theoretically obtain the probability that the new allele establishes in the population, or the establishment probability. We also show an analytical expression for the trajectory of allele frequency along the establishment, from which the time required for the establishment is obtained, or the establishment time. Under this model, divergent selection simply favors the new allele to fix where it is beneficial, whereas assortative mating works against rare alleles. It is theoretically demonstrated that the fate of the new allele is determined by the relative contributions of the two selective forces, divergent selection and assortative mating, when the allele is rare so that the two selective forces counteract. Our theoretical results for the establishment probability and time allow us to understand the relative role of random genetic drift in the establishment process of a magic trait allele in a finite population.

AB  - The dynamics of evolution is intimately shaped by epistasis interactions between genetic elements which cause the fitness-effect of combinations of mutations to be non-additive. Analyzing evolutionary dynamics that involves large numbers of epistatic mutations is intrinsically difficult. A crucial feature is that the fitness landscape in the vicinity of the current genome depends on the evolutionary history. A key step is thus developing models that enable study of the effects of past evolution on future evolution. In this work, we introduce a broad class of high-dimensional random fitness landscapes for which the correlations between fitnesses of genomes are a general function of genetic distance. Their Gaussian character allows for tractable computational as well as analytic understanding. We study the properties of these landscapes focusing on the simplest evolutionary process: random adaptive (uphill) walks. Conventional measures of "ruggedness" are shown to not much affect such adaptive walks. Instead, the long-distance statistics of epistasis cause all properties to be highly conditional on past evolution, determining the statistics of the local landscape (the distribution of fitness-effects of available mutations and combinations of these), as well as the global geometry of evolutionary trajectories. In order to further explore the effects of conditioning on past evolution, we model the effects of slowly changing environments. At long times, such fitness "seascapes" cause a statistical steady state with highly intermittent evolutionary dynamics: populations undergo bursts of rapid adaptation, interspersed with periods in which adaptive mutations are rare and the population waits for more new directions to be opened up by changes in the environment. Finally, we discuss prospects for studying more complex evolutionary dynamics and on broader classes of high-dimensional landscapes and seascapes. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this paper we study spatially clustered distribution of individuals using point process theory. In particular we discuss the spatially explicit neutral model of population dynamics of Shimatani (2010) which extends previous works on Malecot theory of isolation by distance. We reformulate Shimatani model of replicated Neyman-Scott process to allow for a general dispersal kernel function and we show that the random migration hypothesis can be substituted by the long dispersal distance property of the kernel. Moreover, the extended framework presented here is fit to handle spatially explicit statistical estimators of genetic variability like Moran autocorrelation index or Sorensen similarity index. We discuss the pivotal role of the choice of dispersal kernel for the above estimators in a toy model of dynamic population genetics theory. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Empirical studies have shown that, unlike species with specialized resource requirements, generalist species may benefit from habitat destruction. We use a family of models to probe the causes of the contrasting responses of these two types of species to habitat destruction. Our approach allows a number of mechanisms to be switched on and off, thereby making it possible to study their marginal and joint effects. Unlike many previous models, we do not assume any intrinsic competitive asymmetry between the species, and we assume pre-emptive rather than displacement competition. Under these assumptions, in the mean-field model the prevalences of all species decrease monotonically with decreasing habitat availability, independently of the degree of specialization. However, in the stochastic and spatial individual-based simulations of the same model, the specialists dominate in landscapes of high quality, whereas generalists thrive in landscapes of intermediate quality; no species persist in very poor landscapes. The same pattern also occurs in a non-spatial stochastic model but not in a deterministic spatial model, showing that demographic stochasticity plays a key role in shaping the outcome of competitive interactions.

AB  - Because the Lotka-Volterra competitive equations posit no specific competitive mechanisms, they are exceedingly general, and can theoretically approximate any underlying mechanism of competition near equilibrium. In practice, however, these models rarely generate accurate predictions in diverse communities. We propose that this difference between theory and practice may be caused by how uncertainty propagates through Lotka-Volterra systems. In approximating mechanistic relationships with Lotka-Volterra models, associations among parameters are lost, and small variation can correspond to large and unrealistic changes in predictions. We demonstrate that constraining Lotka-Volterra models using correlations among parameters expected from hypothesized underlying mechanisms can reintroduce some of the underlying structure imposed by those mechanisms, thereby improving model predictions by both reducing bias and increasing precision. Our results suggest that this hybrid approach may combine some of the generality of phenomenological models with the broader applicability and meaningful interpretability of mechanistic approaches. These methods could be useful in poorly understood systems for identifying important coexistence mechanisms, or for making more accurate predictions. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper explores the effects of increasing spatial subdivision of habitat on competition between two species. An increase in the degree of subdivision without any increase in the total amount of resources in the environment leads to smaller patch sizes, and thus, fewer individuals supported per patch. This fact suggests that when the degree of subdivision is high, the minimum resources that an individual must obtain before reproduction become important. Competition equations derived from first-principles that incorporate the minimum resource requirement are employed to investigate the effects of spatial subdivision and how these effects depend on the minimum requirements of the two species, type of resource competition such as scramble or contest, and spatial aggregation level of individuals. The results show that increased subdivision leads to changes in "effective fecundities" of the species, and consequently, affects their competitive superiority. Species coexistence is promoted at intermediate subdivision levels, especially if there is a trade-off between the minimum resource requirement and inherent fecundity. The range of subdivision in which coexistence occurs depends on the spatial aggregation of individuals and inequality in competitive ability between the species. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - A novel outbreak will generally not be detected until such a time that it has become established. When such an outbreak is detected, public health officials must determine the potential of the outbreak, for which the basic reproductive number R-0 is an important factor. However, it is often the case that the resulting estimate of R-0 is positively-biased for a number of reasons. One commonly overlooked reason is that the outbreak was not detected until such a time that it had become established, and therefore did not experience initial fade out. We propose a method which accounts for this bias by conditioning the underlying epidemic model on becoming established and demonstrate that this approach leads to a less biased estimate of R-0 during the early stages of an outbreak. We also present a computationally-efficient approximation scheme which is suitable for large data sets in which the number of notified cases is large. This methodology is applied to an outbreak of pandemic influenza in Western Australia, recorded in 2009. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - A central question in the study of ecology and evolution is: "Why are there so many species?" It has been shown that certain forms of the Lotka-Volterra (L-V) competition equations lead to an unlimited number of species. Furthermore, these authors note how any change in the nature of competition (the competition kernel) leads to a finite or small number of coexisting species. Here we build upon these works by further investigating the L-V model of unlimited niche packing as a reference model and evolutionary game for understanding the environmental factors restricting biodiversity. We also examine the combined eco-evolutionary dynamics leading up to the species diversity and traits of the ESS community in both unlimited and finite niche-pacldng versions of the model. As an L-V game with symmetric competition, we let the strategies of individuals determine the strength of the competitive interaction (like competes most with like) and also the carrying capacity of the population. We use a mixture of analytic proofs (for one and two species systems) and numerical simulations. For the model of unlimited niche packing, we show that a finite number of species will evolve to specific convergent stable minima of the adaptive landscape (also known as species archetypes). Starting with a single species, faunal buildup can proceed either through species doubling as each diversity-specific set of minima are reached, or through the addition of species one-by-one by randomly assigning a speciation event to one of the species. Either way it is possible for an unlimited number or species to evolve and coexist. We examine two simple and biologically likely ways for breaking the unlimited niche-packing: (1) some minimum level of competition among species, and (2) constrain the fundamental niche of the trait space to a finite interval. When examined under both ecological and evolutionary dynamics, both modifications result in convergent stable ESSs with a finite number of species. When the number of species is held below the number of species in an ESS coalition, we see a diverse array of convergent stable niche archetypes that consist of some species at maxima and some at minima of the adaptive landscape. Our results support those of others and suggest that instead of focusing on why there are so many species we might just as usefully ask, why are there so few species? (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Recently, Burden and Tang (2016) provided an analytical expression for the stationary distribution of the multivariate neutral Wright-Fisher model with low mutation rates. In this paper we present a simple, alternative derivation that illustrates the approximation. Our proof is based on the discrete multivariate boundary mutation model which has three key ingredients. First, the decoupled Moran model is used to describe genetic drift. Second, low mutation rates are assumed by limiting mutations to monomorphic states. Third, the mutation rate matrix is separated into a time-reversible part and a flux part, as suggested by Burden and Tang (2016). An application of our result to data from several great apes reveals that the assumption of stationarity may be inadequate or that other evolutionary forces like selection or biased gene conversion are acting. Furthermore we find that the model with a reversible mutation rate matrix provides a reasonably good fit to the data compared to the one with a non-reversible mutation rate matrix.

AB  - Under the coalescent model, the random number n(t) of lineages ancestral to a sample is nearly deterministic as a function of time when n(t) is moderate to large in value, and it is well approximated by its expectation E[n(t)]. In turn, this expectation is well approximated by simple deterministic functions that are easy to compute. Such deterministic functions have been applied to estimate allele age, effective population size, and genetic diversity, and they have been used to study properties of models of infectious disease dynamics. Although a number of simple approximations of E[n(t)] have been derived and applied to problems of population-genetic inference, the theoretical accuracy of the resulting approximate formulas and the inferences obtained using these approximations is not known, and the range of problems to which they can be applied is not well understood. Here, we demonstrate general procedures by which the approximation n(t) approximate to E[n(t)] can be used to reduce the computational complexity of coalescent formulas, and we show that the resulting approximations converge to their true values under simple assumptions. Such approximations provide alternatives to exact formulas that are computationally intractable or numerically unstable when the number of sampled lineages is moderate or large. We also extend an existing class of approximations of E[n(t)] to the case of multiple populations of time-varying size with migration among them. Our results facilitate the use of the deterministic approximation n(t) approximate to E[n(t)] for deriving functionally simple, computationally efficient, and numerically stable approximations of coalescent formulas under complicated demographic scenarios.

AB  - In classical quantitative genetics, the correlation between the phenotypes of individuals with unknown genotypes and a known pedigree relationship is expressed in terms of probabilities of IBD states. In existing approaches to the inverse problem where genotypes are observed but pedigree relationships are not, dependence between phenotypes is either modeled as Bayesian uncertainty or mapped to an IBD model via inferred relatedness parameters. Neither approach yields a relationship between genotypic similarity and phenotypic similarity with a probabilistic interpretation corresponding to a generative model. We introduce a generative model for diploid allele effect based on the classic infinite allele mutation process. This approach motivates the concept of IBF (Identity by Function). The phenotypic covariance between two individuals given their diploid genotypes is expressed in terms of functional identity states. The IBF parameters define a genetic architecture for a trait without reference to specific alleles or population. Given full genome sequences, we treat a gene-scale functional region, rather than a SNP, as a QTL, modeling patterns of dominance for multiple alleles. Applications demonstrated by simulation include phenotype and effect prediction and association, and estimation of heritability and classical variance components. A simulation case study of the Missing Heritability problem illustrates a decomposition of heritability under the IBF framework into Explained and Unexplained components. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The ancestral selection graph (ASG) was introduced by Neuhauser and Krone (1997) in order to study populations of constant size which evolve under selection. Coalescence events, which occur at rate 1 for every pair of lines, lead to joint ancestry. In addition, splitting events in the ASG at rate alpha, the scaled selection coefficient, produce possible ancestors, such that the real ancestor depends on the ancestral alleles. Here, we use the ASG in the case without mutation in order to study fixation of a beneficial mutant. Using our main tool, a reversibility property of the ASG, we provide a new proof of the fact that a beneficial allele fixes roughly in time (2 log alpha)/alpha if alpha is large.

AB  - A thorough quantitative understanding of populations at the edge of extinction is needed to manage both invasive and extirpating populations. Immigration can govern the population dynamics when the population levels are low. It increases the probability of a population establishing (or reestablishing) before going extinct (EBE). However, the rate of immigration can be highly fluctuating. Here, we investigate how the stochasticity in immigration impacts the EBE probability for small populations in variable environments. We use a population model with an Allee effect described by a stochastic differential equation (SDE) and employ the Fokker-Planck diffusion approximation to quantify the EBE probability. We find that, the effect of the stochasticity in immigration on the EBE probability depends on both the intrinsic growth rate (r) and the mean rate of immigration (p). In general, if r is large and positive (e.g. invasive species introduced to favorable habitats), or if p is greater than the rate of population decline due to the demographic Allee effect (e.g., effective stocking of declining populations), then the stochasticity in immigration decreases the EBE probability. If r is large and negative (e.g. endangered populations in unfavorable habitats), or if the rate of decline due to the demographic Allee effect is much greater than p (e.g., weak stocking of declining populations), then the stochasticity in immigration increases the EBE probability. However, the mean time for EBE decreases with the increasing stochasticity in immigration with both positive and negative large r. Thus, results suggest that ecological management of populations involves a tradeoff as to whether to increase or decrease the stochasticity in immigration in order to optimize the desired outcome. Moreover, the control of invasive species spread through stochastic means, for example, by stochastic monitoring and treatment of vectors such as ship-ballast water, may be suitable strategies given the environmental and demographic uncertainties at introductions. Similarly, the recovery of declining and extirpated populations through stochastic stocking, translocation, and reintroduction, may also be suitable strategies. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - For two Polish state spaces E-X and E-Y, and an operator G(X), we obtain existence and uniqueness of a G(X-) martingale problem provided there is a bounded continuous duality function E-X x E-Y together with a dual process Y on E-Y which is the unique solution of a G(Y)-martingale problem. For the corresponding solutions (X-t)(t >= 0) and (Y-t)(t >= 0), duality with respect to a function H in its simplest form means that the relation E-x[H (X-t, y)] = E-y[H (x, Y-t)] holds for all (x, y) is an element of E-X x E-Y and t >= 0. While duality is well-known to imply uniqueness of the G(X)-martingale problem, we give here a set of conditions under which duality also implies existence without using approximating sequences of processes of a different kind (e.g. jump processes to approximate diffusions) which is a widespread strategy for proving existence of solutions of martingale problems. Given the process (Yt)(t >= 0) and a duality function H, to prove existence of (X-t)(t >= 0) one has to show that the r.h.s. of the duality relation defines for each y a measure on E-X, i.e. there are transition kernels (mu(t))(t >= 0) from E-X to E-X such that Ey[H(x, Yt)] = integral mu(t)(x, dx') H (x' y) for all (x, y) is an element of E-X x E-Y and all t >= 0.
   As examples, we treat resampling and branching models, such as the Fleming-Viot measure-valued diffusion and its spatial counterparts (with both, discrete and continuum space), as well as branching systems, such as Feller's branching diffusion. While our main result as well as all examples come with (locally) compact state spaces, we discuss the strategy to lift our results to genealogy-valued processes or historical processes, leading to non-compact (discrete and continuum) state spaces. Such applications will be tackled in forthcoming work based on the present article.

AB  - Social behavior is divided into four types: altruism, spite, mutualism, and selfishness. The former two are costly to the actor; therefore, from the perspective of natural selection, their existence can be regarded as mysterious. One potential setup which encourages the evolution of altruism and spite is repeated interaction. Players can behave conditionally based on their opponent's previous actions in the repeated interaction. On the one hand, the retaliatory strategy (who behaves altruistically when their opponent behaved altruistically and behaves nonaltruistically when the opponent player behaved non-altruistically) is likely to evolve when players choose altruistic or selfish behavior in each round. On the other hand, the anti-retaliatory strategy (who is spiteful when the opponent was not spiteful and is not spiteful when the opponent player was spiteful) is likely to evolve when players opt for spiteful or mutualistic behavior in each round. These successful conditional behaviors can be favored by natural selection. Here, we notice that information on opponent players' actions is not always available. When there is no such information, players cannot determine their behavior according to their opponent's action. By investigating the case of altruism, a previous study (Kurokawa, 2017, Mathematical Biosciences, 286, 94-103) found that persistent altruistic strategies, which choose the same action as the own previous action, are favored by natural selection. How, then, should a spiteful conditional strategy behave when the player does not know what their opponent did? By studying the repeated game, we find that persistent spiteful strategies, which choose the same action as the own previous action, are favored by natural selection. Altruism and spite differ concerning whether retaliatory or anti-retaliatory strategies are favored by natural selection; however, they are identical concerning whether persistent strategies are favored by natural selection.

AB  - In this article, discrete and stochastic changes in (effective) population size are incorporated into the spectral representation of a biallelic diffusion process for drift and small mutation rates. A forward algorithm inspired by Hidden-Markov-Model (HMM) literature is used to compute exact sample allele frequency spectra for three demographic scenarios: single changes in (effective) population size, boom -bust dynamics, and stochastic fluctuations in (effective) population size. An approach for fully agnostic demographic inference from these sample allele spectra is explored, and sufficient statistics for stepwise changes in population size are found. Further, convergence behaviours of the polymorphic sample spectra for population size changes on different time scales are examined and discussed within the context of inference of the effective population size. Joint visual assessment of the sample spectra and the temporal coefficients of the spectral decomposition of the forward diffusion process is found to be important in determining departure from equilibrium. Stochastic changes in (effective) population size are shown to shape sample spectra particularly strongly.

AB  - The evolution of altruism has been extensively modeled under the assumption of genetic transmission, whereas the dynamics under cultural transmission are less well understood. Previous research has shown that cultural transmission can facilitate the evolution of altruism by increasing (1) the probability of adopting the altruistic phenotype, and (2) assortment between altruists. We incorporate vertical and oblique transmission, which can be conformist or anti-conformist, into models of parental care, sibling altruism, and altruism between individuals that meet assortatively. If oblique transmission is conformist, it becomes easier for altruism to invade a population of non-altruists as the probability of vertical transmission increases. If oblique transmission is anti-conformist, decreasing vertical transmission facilitates invasion by altruism in the assortative meeting model, whereas in other models, there is a trade-off: greater vertical transmission produces greater assortment among genetically related altruists, but lowers the probability of adopting altruism via anti-conformity. Compared to conditions for invasion under genetic transmission, e.g., Hamilton's rule, we show that invasion can be easier with sufficiently strong anti-conformity, and in some models, with sufficiently high assortment even if oblique transmission is conformist. We also explore invasion by an allele A that increases individuals' content bias for altruism, in the absence of other forms of cultural transmission. If costs and benefits combine additively, A invades under previously known conditions. If costs and benefits combine multiplicatively, invasion by A and by altruism become more difficult than in the corresponding additive models. (C) 2021 The Author( s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Conventional pest management mainly relies on the use of pesticides. However, the negative externalities of pesticides are now well known. More sustainable practices, such as Integrated Pest Management, are necessary to limit crop damage from pathogens, pests and weeds in agroecosystems. Reducing pesticide use requires information to determine whether chemical treatments are really needed. Pest monitoring networks (PMNs) are key contributors to this information. However, the effectiveness of a PMN in delivering relevant information about pests depends on its spatial sampling resolution and its memory length. The trade-off between the monitoring efforts and the usefulness of the information provided is highly dependent on pest ecological traits, the damage they can cause (in terms of crop losses), and economic drivers (production costs, agriculture product prices and incentives). Due to the high complexity of optimising PMNs, we have developed a theoretical model that belongs to the family of Dynamic Bayesian Networks in order to compare several PMNs performances. This model links the characteristics of a PMN to treatment decisions and the resulting pest dynamics. Using simulation and inference tools for graphical models, we derived the proportion of impacted fields, the number of pesticide treatments and the overall gross margins for three types of pest with contrasting levels of endocyclism. The term "endocyclic'' refers to an organism whose development is mostly restricted to a field and highly depends on the inoculum present in the considered field. The presence of purely endocyclic pests at a given time increases the probability of reoccurrence. Conversely, slightly endocyclic pests have a low persistence. The simulation analysis considered ten scenarios: an expected margin-based strategy with a spatial resolution of four PMNs and two memory lengths (one year or eight years), as well as two extreme crop protection strategies (systematic treatments on all fields and systematic no treatment). For purely and mainly endocyclic pests (e.g. soil-borne pathogens and most weeds, respectively), we found that increasing the spatial resolution of PMNs made it possible to significantly decrease the number of treatments required for pest control. Taking past observations into account was also effective, but to a lesser extent. PMN information had virtually no influence on the control of non-endocyclic pests (such as flying insects or airborne plant pathogens) which may be due to the spatial coverage addressed in our study. The next step is to extend the analysis of PMNs and to integrate the information generated by PMNs into sustainable pest management strategies, both at the field and the landscape level.

AB  - Ecological character displacement is a prominent hypothesis for the maintenance of ecological differences between species that are critical to stable coexistence. Models of character displacement often ascribe interspecific competitive interactions to a single character, but multiple characters contribute to competition, and their effects on selection can be nonadditive. Focusing on one character, we ask if other characters that affect competition alter evolutionary outcomes for the focal character. We address this question using the variable environment seed bank model for two species with two traits. The focal trait is the temporal pattern of germination, which is evolutionary labile. The other trait is the temporal pattern of plant growth, which is assumed fixed. We ask whether evolutionary divergence of germination patterns between species depends on species differences in plant growth. Patterns of growth can affect selection on germination patterns in two ways. First, cues present at germination can provide information about future growth. Second, germination and growth jointly determine the biomass of plants, which determines demand for resources. Germination and growth contribute to the selection gradient in distinct components, one density-independent and the other density-dependent. Importantly, the relative strengths of the components are key. When the density-dependent component is stronger, displacement in germination patterns between species is larger. Stronger cues at germination strengthen the density-independent component by increasing the benefits of germinating in years of favorable growth. But cues also affect the density dependent component by boosting a species' biomass, and hence its competitive effect, in good years. Consequently, cues weaken character displacement when growth patterns are similar for two competitors, but favor displacement when growth patterns are species-specific. Understanding how these selection components change between contexts can help understand the origin and maintenance of species differences in germination patterns in temporally fluctuating environments.

AB  - Territorial behaviour is an important part of the lives of many animals. Once a territory has been acquired, an animal may spend its entire life on it, and may have to repeatedly defend it from conspecifics. Some species make great investments in the defence of a territory, and this defence can be costly, in terms of time, energy and risk of injury. Time costs in particular have rarely been explicitly factored into such models. In this paper we consider a model of territorial defence which includes both population dynamic and time delay elements, building upon recent advances in time constraint models. Populations may divide into two distinct types, where one type makes no effort to control territories. We shall call this type nomads, and the other type territorials. Here the territory owners must divide their time between patrolling and foraging, and this balance is their only strategic decision. We show how to find the evolutionarily stable patrolling strategy and the population composition of territorials and nomads, and consider some examples demonstrating key situations. We see that both time constraints and population density pressure are crucial to influencing behaviour. In particular we find cases with both territorial individuals and nomads where a mixed, either pure or both pure patrolling strategies are evolutionarily stable. In different conditions either nomads or territorials can be absent, and indeed for a significant range of parameter combinations the population can exhibit tristability, with three distinct ecologically stable population compositions: with both nomads and territorials, only nomads or only territorials.

AB  - Classical stochastic demography predicts that environmental stochasticity reduces population growth rates and, thereby, can increase extinction risk. In contrast, in a 1978 Theoretical Population Biology paper, Gillespie demonstrated with his stochastic additive scale and concave fitness function (SAS-CFF) model that environmental stochasticity can promote genetic diversity. Extending the SAS-CFF to account for demography, I examine the simultaneous effects of environmental stochasticity on genetic diversity and population persistence. Explicit expressions for the per-capita growth rates of rare alleles and the population at low-density are derived. Consistent with Gillespie's analysis, if the log-fitness function is concave and allelic responses to the environment are not perfectly correlated, then per-capita growth rates of rare alleles are positive and genetic diversity is maintained in the sense of stochastic persistence i.e. allelic frequencies tend to stay away from zero almost-surely and in probability. Alternatively, if the log-fitness function is convex, then per-capita growth rates of rare alleles are negative and an allele asymptotically fixates with probability one. If the population's low-density, per-capita growth rate is positive, then the population persists in the sense of stochastic persistence, else it goes asymptotically extinct with probability one. In contrast to per-capita growth rates of rare alleles, the population's per-capita growth rate is a decreasing function of the concavity of the log-fitness function. Moreover, when the log-fitness function is concave, allelic diversity increases the population's per-capita growth rate while decreasing the per-capita growth rate of rare alleles; when the log-fitness function is convex, environmental stochasticity decreases the per-capita growth rate of rare alleles, but increases the population's per-capita growth rate. Collectively, these results (i) highlight how mechanisms promoting population persistence may be at odds with mechanisms promoting genetic diversity, and (ii) provide conditions under which population persistence relies on existing standing genetic variation.

AB  - Fluctuations in population size may have negative consequences (e.g., an increased risk of extinction or the occurrence of repeated outbreaks), and many management strategies are aimed at avoiding them by either only restocking or only harvesting the population. Two of these strategies are adaptive limiter control (ALC) and adaptive threshold harvesting (ATH). With ALC the population is controlled by only restocking and with ATH by only harvesting. We propose the strategy of combined adaptive limiter control (CALC) as the combination of ALC and ATH and study the potential advantages of CALC over ALC and ATH. We consider two different population models, namely a stochastic overcompensatory model and a host-pathogen-predator model. For the first model, our results show that the combination of restocking and harvesting under CALC improves the constancy stability of the managed populations when the harvesting and restocking intensities are high enough. Otherwise the effect is marginal or in rare cases negative. For the second model, we show that combining harvesting with restocking reduces the outbreak risk only if the harvesting intensity is low. For medium harvesting intensities the effect is marginal and for high harvesting intensities the risk of outbreaks is increased. In addition, we study the optimal harvesting-restocking balance by considering a proxy of the benefit obtained in terms of the reduction in the outbreak risk and the harvesting and restocking costs.

AB  - We consider a class of continuous-time branching processes called Markovian binary trees (MBTs), in which the individuals lifetime and reproduction epochs are modelled using a transient Markovian arrival process (TMAP). We develop methods for estimating the parameters of the TMAP by using either age-specific averages of reproduction and mortality rates, or age-specific individual demographic data. Depending on the degree of detail of the available information, we follow a weighted non-linear regression or a maximum likelihood approach. We discuss several criteria to determine the optimal number of states in the underlying TMAP. Our results improve the fit of an existing MBT model for human demography, and provide insights for the future conservation management of the threatened Chatham Island black robin population.

AB  - The mating distribution caused by mate choice can be expressed as a gain in information with respect to random mating. In that view, the population phenotype frequencies had been considered constant during the breeding season. Here, such restriction was relaxed to consider encounter-mating processes in which first, the encounter between partners depends on the phenotype distribution of the population, and second, the mating after the encounter depends on the mutual mating propensities. Under this setting, the population phenotype frequencies are no longer constant because the process of pair formation occurs in discrete intervals of time, called mating rounds where at least one mating pair is formed, and the frequency of phenotypes available for the next mating, changes. Provided that there are more than one mating round per breeding season, the population phenotype frequencies are no longer constant.
   Similarly to the constant case, we describe the change in the mating phenotypes by the flow of information with respect to random mating. This information can be partitioned into sexual selection, assortative mating (sexual isolation) and their mixed effect. Likewise, the pairwise statistics for total change, sexual selection and assortative mating are generalized for variable population phenotype frequencies.
   The new tests had more power to detect the effects of non-random mating when the phenotype frequencies varied during the breeding season. The differences in power were high for sexual selection but minor for assortative mating scenarios. However, the application of the new formulas requires the estimation of phenotype frequencies at each mating round. Therefore, choosing one or another type of statistics would depend on the biological scenario as well as the availability and easiness to split the sampling in more than one mating round.

AB  - In population genetics, diffusions on the unit interval are often used to model the frequency path of an allele. In this setting we derive approximations for fixation probabilities, expected hitting times and the expected frequency spectrum for low levels of frequency-dependent selection. Specifically, we rederive and extend the one-third rule of evolutionary game theory (Nowak et al., 2004) and effects of stochastic slowdown (Altrock and Traulsen, 2009). Since similar effects are of interest in other application areas, we formulate our results for general one-dimensional diffusions. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - We consider inference about the history of a sample of DNA sequences, conditional upon the haplotype counts and the number of segregating sites observed at the present time. After deriving some theoretical results in the coalescent setting, we implement rejection sampling and importance sampling schemes to perform the inference. The importance sampling scheme addresses an extension of the Ewens Sampling Formula for a configuration of haplotypes and the number of segregating sites in the sample. The implementations include both constant and variable population size models. The methods are illustrated by two human Y chromosome datasets. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Change points in the dynamics of animal abundances have extensively been recorded in historical time series records. Little attention has been paid to the theoretical dynamic consequences of such change points. Here we propose a change-point model of stochastic population dynamics. This investigation embodies a shift of attention from the problem of detecting when a change will occur, to another non-trivial puzzle: using ecological theory to understand and predict the post-breakpoint behavior of the population dynamics. The proposed model and the explicit expressions derived here predict and quantify how density dependence modulates the influence of the pre-breakpoint parameters into the post-breakpoint dynamics. Time series transitioning from one stationary distribution to another contain information about where the process was before the change-point, where is it heading and how long it will take to transition, and here this information is explicitly stated. Importantly, our results provide a direct connection of the strength of density dependence with theoretical properties of dynamic systems, such as the concept of resilience. Finally, we illustrate how to harness such information through maximum likelihood estimation for state-space models, and test the model robustness to widely different forms of compensatory dynamics. The model can be used to estimate important quantities in the theory and practice of population recovery. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - As an individual moves through its life cycle, it passes through a series of states (age classes, size classes, reproductive states, spatial locations, health statuses, etc.) before its eventual death. The occupancy time in a state is the time spent in that state over the individual's life. Depending on the life cycle description, the occupancy times describe different demographic variables, for example, lifetime breeding success, lifetime habitat utilisation, or healthy longevity.
   Models based on absorbing Markov chains provide a powerful framework for the analysis of occupancy times. Current theory, however, can completely analyse only the occupancy of single states, although the occupancy time in a set of states is often desired. For example, a range of sizes in a size-classified model, an age class in an age x stage model, and a group of locations in a spatial stage model are all sets of states.
   We present a new mathematical approach to absorbing Markov chains that extends the analysis of life histories by providing a comprehensive theory for the occupancy of arbitrary sets of states, and for other demographic variables related to these sets (e.g., reaching time, return time). We apply this approach to a matrix population model of the Southern Fulmar (Fulmarus glacialoides). The analysis of this model provides interesting insight into the lifetime number of breeding attempts of this species.
   Our new approach to absorbing Markov chains, and its implementation in matrix oriented software, makes the analysis of occupancy times more accessible to population ecologists, and directly applicable to any matrix population models. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Duality plays an important role in population genetics. It can relate results from forwards-in-time models of allele frequency evolution with those of backwards-in-time genealogical models; a well known example is the duality between the Wright-Fisher diffusion for genetic drift and its genealogical counterpart, the coalescent. There have been a number of articles extending this relationship to include other evolutionary processes such as mutation and selection, but little has been explored for models also incorporating crossover recombination. Here, we derive from first principles a new genealogical process which is dual to a Wright-Fisher diffusion model of drift, mutation, and recombination. The process is reminiscent of the ancestral recombination graph, a widely-used multilocus genealogical model, but here ancestral lineages are typed and transition rates are regarded as being conditioned on an observed configuration at the leaves of the genealogy. Our approach is based on expressing a putative duality relationship between two models via their infinitesimal generators, and then seeking an appropriate test function to ensure the validity of the duality equation. This approach is quite general, and we use it to find dualities for several important variants, including both a discrete L-locus model of a gene and a continuous model in which mutation and recombination events are scattered along the gene according to continuous distributions. As an application of our results, we derive a series expansion for the transition function of the diffusion. Finally, we study in further detail the case in which mutation is absent. Then the dual process describes the dispersal of ancestral genetic material across the ancestors of a sample. The stationary distribution of this process is of particular interest; we show how duality relates this distribution to haplotype fixation probabilities. We develop an efficient method for computing such probabilities in multilocus models. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - This article evaluates bias in one class of methods used to estimate archaic admixture in modern humans. These methods study the pattern of allele sharing among modern and archaic genomes. They are sensitive to "ghost" admixture, which occurs when a population receives archaic DNA from sources not acknowledged by the statistical model. The effect of ghost admixture depends on two factors: branch-length bias and population-size bias. Branch-length bias occurs because a given amount of admixture has a larger effect if the two populations have been separated for a long time. Population-size bias occurs because differences in population size distort branch lengths in the gene genealogy. In the absence of ghost admixture, these effects are small. They become important, however, in the presence of ghost admixture. Estimators differ in the pattern of response. Increasing a given parameter may inflate one estimator but deflate another. For this reason, comparisons among estimators are informative. Using such comparisons, this article supports previous findings that the archaic population was small and that Europeans received little gene flow from archaic populations other than Neanderthals. It also identifies an inconsistency in estimates of archaic admixture into Melanesia. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The evolution of microbe-microbe mutualistic symbiosis is considered to be promoted by repeated exchanges of fitness benefits, which can generate positive fitness feedbacks ('partner fidelity feedback') between species. However, previous evolutionary models for mutualism have not captured feedback dynamics or coupling of fitness between species. Here, a simple population model is developed to understand the evolution of mutualistic symbiosis in which two microbial species (host and symbiont) continuously grow and exchange fitness benefits to generate feedback dynamics but do not strictly control each other. The assumption that individual microbes provide constant amounts of resources, which are equally divided among interacting partner individual, enables us to reveal a simple rule for the evolution of costly mutualism with positive fitness feedbacks: the product of the benefit-to-cost ratios for each species exceeds one. When this condition holds, high cooperative investment levels are favored in both species regardless of the amount invested by each partner. The model is then extended to examine how symbiont mutation, immigration, or switching affects the spread of selfish or cooperative symbionts, which decrease and increase their investment levels, respectively. In particular, when a host associates with numerous symbionts without enforcement, neither mutation nor immigration but rather random switching would allow the spread of cooperative symbionts. Examples using symbiont switching for evolution would include large ciliates hosting numerous intracellular endosymbionts. The simple model and rules would provide a basis for understanding the evolution of microbe-microbe mutualistic symbiosis with positive fitness feedbacks and without enforcement mechanisms.

AB  - We consider how a population of.. haploid individuals responds to directional selection on standing variation, with no new variation from recombination or mutation. Individuals have trait values..1,.,...., which are drawn from a distribution..; the fitness of individual.. is proportional to....... For illustration, we consider the Laplace and Gaussian distributions, which are parametrised only by the variance..0, and show that for large.., there is a scaling limit which depends on a single parameter.. v..0. When selection is weak relative to drift (.. v.. 0 << 1), the variance decreases exponentially at rate 1/.., and the expected ultimate gain in log fitness (scaled by v..0), is just.. v..0, which is the same as Robertson's (1960) prediction for a sexual population. In contrast, when selection is strong relative to drift (..v.. 0 >> 1), the ultimate gain can be found by approximating the establishment of alleles by a branching process in which each allele competes independently with the population mean and the fittest allele to establish is certain to fix. Then, if the probability of survival to time.. 1/v.. 0 of an allele with value.. is.. (..), with mean.., the winning allele is the fittest of.... survivors drawn from a distribution.... /... The expected ultimate change is v 2 log(1.15.. v..0) for a Gaussian distribution, and -v1 2 [ log ( 0.36.. v.. 0) - log ( - log ( 0.36..v.. 0))] for a Laplace distribution. This approach also predicts the variability of the process, and its dynamics; we show that in the strong selection regime, the expected genetic variance decreases as ..-3 at large times. We discuss how these results may be related to selection on standing variation that is spread along a linear chromosome.

AB  - Modern molecular technologies have revolutionized our understanding of bacterial epidemiology, but reported data across studies and different geographic endemic settings remain under-integrated in common theoretical frameworks. Pneumococcus serotype co-colonization, caused by the polymorphic bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae, has been increasingly investigated and reported in recent years. While the global genomic diversity and serotype distribution of S. pneumoniae have been well-characterized, there is limited information on how co-colonization patterns vary globally, critical for understanding the evolution and transmission dynamics of the bacteria. Gathering a rich dataset of cross-sectional pneumococcal colonization studies in the literature, we quantified patterns of transmission intensity and co-colonization prevalence variation in children populations across 17 geographic locations. Linking these data to an SIS model with cocolonization under the assumption of quasi-neutrality among multiple interacting strains, our analysis reveals strong patterns of negative covariation between transmission intensity (R-0) and susceptibility to co-colonization (k). In line with expectations from the stress-gradient-hypothesis in ecology (SGH), pneumococcus serotypes appear to compete more in co-colonization in high-transmission settings and compete less in low-transmission settings, a trade-off which ultimately leads to a conserved ratio of single to co-colonization mu = 1/(R-0-1). From the mathematical model's behavior, such conservation suggests preservation of 'stability-diversity-complexity' regimes in coexistence of similar co-colonizing strains. We find no major differences in serotype compositions across studies, pointing to adaptation of the same set of serotypes across variable environments as an explanation for their differential interaction in different transmission settings. Our work highlights that the understanding of transmission patterns of Streptococcus pneumoniae from global scale epidemiological data can benefit from simple analytical approaches that account for quasi-neutrality among strains, co-colonization, as well as variable environmental adaptation.

AB  - In classical epidemic theory, behavior is assumed to be stationary. In recent years, epidemic models have been extended to include behaviors that transition in response to the current state of the epidemic. However, it is widely known that human behavior can exhibit strong history-dependence as a consequence of learned experiences. This history-dependence is similar to hysteresis phenomena that have been well-studied in control theory. To illustrate the importance of history-dependence for epidemic theory, we study dynamics of a variant of the SIRS model where individuals exhibit lazy-switch responses to prevalence dynamics, based on the Preisach hysteresis operator. The resulting model can possess a continuum of endemic equilibrium states characterized by different proportions of susceptible, infected and recovered populations. We consider how the limit point of the epidemic trajectory and the infection peak along this trajectory depend on the degree of heterogeneity of the response. Our approach supports the argument that public health responses during the emergence of a new disease can have fundamental long-term consequences for subsequent management efforts.

AB  - For the two-patch logistic model, we study the effect of dispersal intensity and dispersal asymmetry on the total population abundance and its distribution. Two complete classifications of the model parameter space are given: one concerning when dispersal causes smaller or larger total biomass than no dispersal, and the other addressing how the total biomass changes with dispersal intensity and dispersal asymmetry. The dependencies of the population abundance of each individual patch on dispersal intensity and dispersal asymmetry are also fully characterized. In addition, the maximal and minimal total population sizes induced by dispersal are determined for the logistic model with an arbitrary number of patches, and a weak order-preserving result correlated the local population abundances with and without dispersal is established.

AB  - In the evolutionary biology literature, it is generally assumed that for deterministic frequency-independent haploid selection models, no polymorphic equilibrium can be stable in the absence of variation-generating mechanisms such as mutation. However, mathematical analyses that corroborate this claim are scarce and almost always depend upon additional assumptions. Using ideas from game theory, we show that a monomorphism is a global attractor if one of its alleles dominates all other alleles at its locus. Further, we show that no isolated equilibrium exists, at which an unequal number of alleles from two loci is present. Under the assumption of convergence of trajectories to equilibrium points, we resolve the two-locus three-allele case for a fitness scheme formally equivalent to the classical symmetric viability model. We also provide an alternative proof for the two-locus two-allele case. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Biological control, the use of predators and pathogens to control target pests, is a promising alternative to chemical control. It is hypothesized that the introduced predators efficacy can be boosted by providing them with an additional food source. The current literature (Srinivasu, 2007; 2010; 2011) claims that if the additional food is of sufficiently large quantity and quality then pest eradication is possible in finite time. The purpose of the current manuscript is to show that to the contrary, pest eradication is not possible in finite time, for any quantity and quality of additional food. We show that pest eradication will occur only in infinite time, and derive decay rates to the extinction state. We posit a new modeling framework to yield finite time pest extinction. Our results have large scale implications for the effective design of biological control methods involving additional food. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Domesticated individuals are likely to be maladaptive in the wild due to adaptation to captivity. Escaped aquaculture fish can cause unintended fitness and demographic consequences for their wild conspecifics through interbreeding and competition. Escape events from different sources exhibit great heterogeneity in their frequencies and magnitudes, ranging from rare but large spillover during a storm, to continuous low-level leakage caused by operational errors. The timescale of escape events determines the distribution of gene flow from aquaculture to the wild. The evolutionary consequences of this variation in timescale will depend on the degree of generation overlap and the focal species' life history attributes, especially those under selection in aquaculture (e.g., growth rate, which can influence additional demographically important traits such as age at maturity). To evaluate the effects of variable escape both within and across generations, we construct an age-structured model of coupled genetic and demographic dynamics and parameterize it for species with contrasting life history characteristics (Salmo solar and Gadus morhua). Our results are consistent with earlier discrete-generation models that constant, low-level spillover can have a greater impact than rare, large pulses of leakage, even after accounting for the averaging effects of overlapping generations. The age-structured model also allows detailed evaluation of the role of different life history traits, which reveals that species with longer generation times might experience greater fitness consequences of aquaculture spillover but are less sensitive to variability in spillover. Additionally, environment-induced earlier maturity of escapees can increase the fitness effects on wild fish, especially those with shorter generation times. Our results suggest that effective management to minimize the unintended fitness consequences of aquaculture releases might require extensive monitoring efforts on constant, low-level spillover and assessment of the focal species' life history characteristics.

AB  - Using a nonparametric Bayesian approach Palacios and Minin (2013) dramatically improved the accuracy, precision of Bayesian inference of population size trajectories from gene genealogies. These authors proposed an extension of a Gaussian Process (GP) nonparametric inferential method for the intensity function of non-homogeneous Poisson processes. They found that not only the statistical properties of the estimators were improved with their method, but also, that key aspects of the demographic histories were recovered. The authors' work represents the first Bayesian nonparametric solution to this inferential problem because they specify a convenient prior belief without a particular functional form on the population trajectory. Their approach works so well and provides such a profound understanding of the biological process, that the question arises as to how truly "biology-free" their approach really is. Using well-known concepts of stochastic population dynamics, here I demonstrate that in fact, Palacios and Minin's GP model can be cast as a parametric population growth model with density dependence and environmental stochasticity. Making this link between population genetics and stochastic population dynamics modeling provides novel insights into eliciting biologically meaningful priors for the trajectory of the effective population size. The results presented here also bring novel understanding of GP as models for the evolution of a trait. Thus, the ecological principles foundation of Palacios and Minin (2013)'s prior adds to the conceptual and scientific value of these authors' inferential approach. I conclude this note by listing a series of insights brought about by this connection with Ecology. (C) 2017 The Author. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - In this study, we present a new theory of partitioning of disease prevalence and incidence-based mortality and demonstrate how this theory practically works for analyses of Medicare data. In the theory, the prevalence of a disease and incidence-based mortality are modeled in terms of disease incidence and survival after diagnosis supplemented by information on disease prevalence at the initial age and year available in a dataset. Partitioning of the trends of prevalence and mortality is calculated with minimal assumptions. The resulting expressions for the components of the trends are given by continuous functions of data. The estimator is consistent and stable. The developed methodology is applied for data on type 2 diabetes using individual records from a nationally representative 5% sample of Medicare beneficiaries age 65+. Numerical estimates show excellent concordance between empirical estimates and theoretical predictions. Evaluated partitioning model showed that both prevalence and mortality increase with time. The primary driving factors of the observed prevalence increase are improved survival and increased prevalence at age 65. The increase in diabetes-related mortality is driven by increased prevalence and unobserved trends in time-periods and age-groups outside of the range of the data used in the study. Finally, the properties of the new estimator, possible statistical and systematical uncertainties, and future practical applications of this methodology in epidemiology, demography, public health and health forecasting are discussed.

AB  - Difference in male and female effective population sizes has, at times, been attributed to both sexes having unequal variance in their number of offspring. Such difference is paralleled by the relative effective sizes of autosomes, sex chromosomes, and mitochondrial DNA. I develop a simple framework to calculate the inbreeding effective population sizes for loci with different modes of inheritance. In this framework, I separate the effects due to mating strategy and those due to genetic transmission. I then show that, in addition to differences in the variance in offspring number, skew in the male/female effective sizes can also be caused by family composition. This approach can be used to illustrate the effect of induced behaviors on the relative male and female effective population sizes. In particular, I show the impact of the one-child policy formerly implemented in the People's Republic of China on the relative male and female effective population sizes. Furthermore, I argue that, under some strong constraints on family structure, the concepts of male and female effective population sizes are invalid. (C) 2016 The Author. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - A procedure is described for estimating evolutionary rate matrices from observed site frequency data. The procedure assumes (1) that the data are obtained from a constant size population evolving according to a stationary Wright-Fisher or decoupled Moran model; (2) that the data consist of a multiple alignment of a moderate number of sequenced genomes drawn randomly from the population; and (3) that within the genome a large number of independent, neutral sites evolving with a common mutation rate matrix can be identified. No restrictions are imposed on the scaled rate matrix other than that the off-diagonal elements are positive, their sum is << 1, and that the rows of the matrix sum to zero. In particular the rate matrix is not assumed to be reversible. The key to the method is an approximate stationary solution to the diffusion limit, forward Kolmogorov equation for neutral evolution in the limit of low mutation rates. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - It has long been debated if population size is a crucial determinant of the level of culture. While empirical results are mixed, recent theoretical studies suggest that social connectedness between people may be a more important factor than the size of the entire population. These models, however, do not take into account evolutionary responses of learning strategies determining the mode of transmission and innovation and are hence not suitable for predicting the long-term implications of parameters of interest. In the present paper, to address this issue, we provide a gene-culture coevolution model, in which the microscopic learning process of each individual is explicitly described as a continuous-time stochastic process and time allocation to social and individual learning is allowed to evolve. We have found that social connectedness has a larger impact on the equilibrium level of culture than population size especially when connectedness is weak and population size is large. This result, combined with those of previous culture-only models, points to the importance of studying separate effects of population size and internal social structure to better understand spatiotemporal variation in the level of culture.

AB  - In population and evolutionary biology, hypotheses about micro-evolutionary and macro-evolutionary processes are commonly tested by comparing the shape indices of empirical evolutionary trees with those predicted by neutral models. A key ingredient in this approach is the ability to compute and quantify distributions of various tree shape indices under random models of interest. As a step to meet this challenge, in this paper we investigate the joint distribution of cherries and pitchforks (that is, subtrees with two and three leaves) under two widely used null models: the Yule-Harding-Kingman (YHK) model and the proportional to distinguishable arrangements (PDA) model. Based on two novel recursive formulae, we propose a dynamic approach to numerically compute the exact joint distribution (and hence the marginal distributions) for trees of any size. We also obtained insights into the statistical properties of trees generated under these two models, including a constant correlation between the cherry and the pitchfork distributions under the YHK model, and the log-concavity and unimodality of the cherry distributions under both models. In addition, we show that there exists a unique change point for the cherry distributions between these two models. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The attempt to understand the statement, and then to find the interpretation, of Fisher's "Fundamental Theorem of Natural Selection" caused problems for generations of population geneticists. Price's (1972) paper was the first to lead to an understanding of the statement of the theorem. The theorem shows (in the discrete-time case) that the so-called "partial change" in mean fitness of a population between a parental generation and an offspring generation is the parental generation additive genetic variance in fitness divided by the parental generation mean fitness. In the continuous-time case the partial rate of change in mean fitness is equal to the parental generation additive genetic variance in fitness with no division by the mean fitness. This "partial change" has been interpreted by some as the change in mean fitness due to changes in gene frequency, and by others as the change in mean fitness due to natural selection. (Fisher variously used both interpretations.) In this paper we discuss these interpretations of the theorem. We indicate why we are unhappy with both. We also discuss the long-term relevance of the Fundamental Theorem of Natural Selection, again reaching a negative assessment. We introduce and discuss the concept of genic evolutionary potential. We finally review an optimizing theorem that involves changes in gene frequency, the additive genetic variance in fitness and the mean fitness itself, all of which are involved in the Fundamental Theorem of Natural Selection, and which is free of the difficulties in interpretation of the Fundamental Theorem of Natural Selection.

AB  - We formulate and analyze a stage-structured consumer-resource biomass model, in which consumers reproduce in a pulsed event at the beginning of a growing season and furthermore go through a niche shift during their life history. We show that the resulting semi-discrete model can exhibit two stable states that can be characterized as a development-controlled state and a reproduction-controlled state. Varying resource availabilities and varying the extent of the niche shift determines whether juveniles or adults are more limited by their resource(s) and can lead to switches between the alternative stable states. Furthermore, we quantify the persistence of the consumer population and the occurrence of the two alternative stable states as a function of resource availabilities and extent of the niche shift. All the results show that irrespective of the type of reproduction of the consumers (continuous or seasonal), the stage-structured model will exhibit alternative stable states as long as development of the juvenile stage and reproduction of the adult stage are both resource-dependent.

AB  - The emergence of cooperation in populations of selfish individuals is a fascinating topic that has inspired much theoretical work. An important model to study cooperation is the phenotypic model, where individuals are characterized by phenotypic properties that are visible to others. The phenotype of an individual can be represented for instance by a vector x = (x(1), ... ,x(n)), where x(1), ... ,x(n) are integers. The population can be well mixed in the sense that everyone is equally likely to interact with everyone else, but the behavioral strategies of the individuals can depend on their distance in the phenotype space. A cooperator can choose to help other individuals exhibiting the same phenotype and defects otherwise. Cooperation is said to be favored by selection if it is more abundant than defection in the stationary state. This means that the average frequency of cooperators in the stationary state strictly exceeds 1/2. Antal et al. (2009c) found conditions that ensure that cooperation is more abundant than defection in a one-dimensional (i.e. n = 1) and an infinite-dimensional (i.e. n = infinity) phenotype space in the case of the Prisoner's Dilemma under weak selection. However, reality lies between these two limit cases. In this paper, we derive the corresponding condition in the case of a phenotype space of any finite dimension. This is done by applying a perturbation method to study a mutation-selection equilibrium under weak selection. This condition is obtained in the limit of a large population size by using the ancestral process. The best scenario for cooperation to be more likely to evolve is found to be a high population-scaled phenotype mutation rate, a low population-scaled strategy mutation rate and a high phenotype space dimension. The biological intuition is that a high population-scaled phenotype mutation rate reduces the quantity of interactions between cooperators and defectors, while a high population-scaled strategy mutation rate introduces newly mutated defectors that invade groups of cooperators. Finally it is easier for cooperation to evolve in a phenotype space of higher dimension because it becomes more difficult for a defector to migrate to a group of cooperators. The difference is significant from n = 1 to n = 2 and from n = 2 to n = 3, but becomes small as soon as n >= 3. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The persistence of populations living in heterogeneous environments crucially depends on the interaction between changes of the environment in space and time, and the way individuals move between locations. Here an approximation for the multiplicative growth rate of a metapopulation is derived, as a function of the properties of the spatial heterogeneity and temporal change in local habitat quality, and the dispersal pattern. This analysis reveals that the growth rate depends on (i) the geometric mean of the average growth rate in the metapopulation, (ii) whether individuals tend to be more numerous in high quality demes and (iii) temporal fluctuations in the spatial distribution of individuals. The two latter effects had been previously identified but mostly in simulation studies. Here I identify them in a unified analytical framework which helps clarifying previous studies. This analysis reveals that the shape of temporal variability interacts with the dispersal rate to determine the growth of the metapopulation, and in particular that the effects of dispersal depend on the level of temporal correlation of the environment.

AB  - The evolution of transgenerational epigenetic adaptation is driven by the invasion and stable inheritance of epialleles. Here, we describe a population-genetic model subject to environmentally-induced epigenetic effects in order to investigate the conditions under which an epigenetically modifiable allele (epiallele) can invade a population insensitive to such cues. Here, epigenetically modifiable individuals have the potential to develop a phenotype that is suitable for their predicted future environment and, provided this prediction is correct, possess a biological advantage compared to their non-modifiable counterpart. However, when individuals experience an environment that 'mismatches' their phenotype, an advantage over unmodifiable individuals may be precluded and instead they experience a decrease in fitness. These epigenetic modifications are then inherited by the next generation which are either epigenetically reset to match their environment or, by resisting environmental cues, maintain their epigenetic status. We found that when environmental cues were common, a severe fitness cost of mismatch between environment and phenotype meant that the disadvantage was too costly and epialleles were less likely to invade. Moreover, for a wide range of parameters, a higher rate of germline epigenetic resetting decreased the likelihood of epiallele invasion. Accordingly, we found that both the frequency of environmental influences and the rate of resetting were central parameters in this system. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Paramutation involves an interaction between homologous alleles resulting in a heritable change in gene expression without altering the DNA sequence. Initially believed to be restricted to plants, paramutation has recently been observed in animal models, and a paramutation-like event has been noted in humans. Despite the accumulating evidence suggesting that trans-acting epigenetic effects can be inherited transgenerationally and therefore generate non-genomic phenotypic variation, these effects have been largely ignored in the context of evolutionary theory. The model presented here incorporates paramutation into the standard model of viability selection at one locus and demonstrates that paramutation can create long-term biological diversity in the absence of genetic change, and even in the absence of the original paramutagenic allele. Therefore, if paramutation is present, attributing evolution to only a traditional genetic model may fail to encompass the broad scope of phenotypic differences observed in nature. Moreover, we show also that an unusual mathematical behaviour, analogous to "Ewens' gap" of the two-locus two-allele symmetric-selection model, occurs: when the rate of one parameter - for example, the rate of paramutation - is increased, a pair of equilibria may disappear only to reappear as this parameter increases further. In summary, by incorporating even the simplest epigenetic parameters into the standard population-genetic model of selection, we show how this type of inheritance system can profoundly alter the course of evolution.

AB  - Species introductions to new habitats can cause a decline in the population size of competing native species and consequently also in their genetic diversity. We are interested in why these adverse effects are weak in some cases whereas in others the native species declines to the point of extinction. While the introduction rate and the growth rate of the introduced species in the new environment clearly have a positive relationship with invasion success and impact, the influence of competition is poorly understood. Here, we investigate how the intensity of interspecific competition influences the persistence time of a native species in the face of repeated and ongoing introductions of the nonnative species. We analyze two stochastic models: a model for the population dynamics of both species and a model that additionally includes the population genetics of the native species at a locus involved in its adaptation to a changing environment. Counterintuitively, both models predict that the persistence time of the native species is lowest for an intermediate intensity of competition. This phenomenon results from the opposing effects of competition at different stages of the invasion process: With increasing competition intensity more introduction events are needed until a new species can establish, but increasing competition also speeds up the exclusion of the native species by an established nonnative competitor. By comparing the ecological and the eco-genetic model, we detect and quantify a synergistic feedback between ecological and genetic effects. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - We approach the questions, what part of evolutionary change results from selection, and what is the adaptive information flow into a population undergoing selection, as a problem of quantifying the divergence of typical trajectories realized under selection from the expected dynamics of their counterparts under a null stochastic -process model representing the absence of selection. This approach starts with a formulation of adaptation in terms of information and from that identifies selection from the genetic parameters that generate information flow; it is the reverse of a historical approach that defines selection in terms of fitness, and then identifies adaptive characters as those amplified in relative frequency by fitness. Adaptive information is a relative entropy on distributions of histories computed directly from the generators of stochastic evolutionary population processes, which in large population limits can be approximated by its leading exponential dependence as a large -deviation function. We study a particular class of generators that represent the genetic dependence of explicit transitions around reproductive cycles in terms of stoichiometry, familiar from chemical reaction networks. Following Smith (2023), which showed that partitioning evolutionary events among genetically distinct realizations of lifecycles yields a more consistent causal analysis through the Price equation than the construction from units of selection and fitness, here we show that it likewise yields more complete evolutionary information measures.

AB  - A multi -type neutral Cannings population model with migration and fixed subpopulation sizes is analyzed. Under appropriate conditions, as all subpopulation sizes tend to infinity, the ancestral process, properly time -scaled, converges to a multi -type coalescent sharing the exchangeability and consistency property. The proof gains from coalescent theory for single -type Cannings models and from decompositions of transition probabilities into parts concerning reproduction and migration respectively. The following section deals with a different but closely related multi -type Cannings model with mutation and fixed total population size but stochastically varying subpopulation sizes. The latter model is analyzed forward and backward in time with an emphasis on its behavior as the total population size tends to infinity. Forward in time, multi -type limiting branching processes arise for large population size. Its backward structure and related open problems are briefly discussed.

AB  - We consider a population distributed between two habitats, in each of which it experiences a growth rate that switches periodically between two values, 1 - epsilon > 0 or -(1 +epsilon) < 0. We study the specific case where the growth rate is positive in one habitat and negative in the other one for the first half of the period, and conversely for the second half of the period, that we refer as the (+/- 1) model. In the absence of migration, the population goes to 0 exponentially fast in each environment. In this paper, we show that, when the period is sufficiently large, a small dispersal between the two patches is able to produce a very high positive exponential growth rate for the whole population, a phenomena called inflation. We prove in particular that the threshold of the dispersal rate at which the inflation appears is exponentially small with the period. We show that inflation is robust to random perturbation, by considering a model where the values of the growth rate in each patch are switched at random times: we prove that inflation occurs for low switching rate and small dispersal. We also consider another stochastic model, where after each period of time T, the values of the growth rates in each patch is chosen randomly, independently from the other patch and from the past. Finally, we provide some extensions to more complicated models, especially epidemiological and density dependent models. (c) 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Synthetic gene drive constructs are being developed to control disease vectors, invasive species, and other pest species. In a well-mixed random mating population a sufficiently strong gene drive is expected to eliminate a target population, but it is not clear whether the same is true when spatial processes play a role. In species with an appropriate biology it is possible that drive-induced reductions in density might lead to increased inbreeding, reducing the efficacy of drive, eventually leading to suppression rather than elimination, regardless of how strong the drive is. To investigate this question we analyse a series of explicitly solvable stochastic models considering a range of scenarios for the relative timing of mating, reproduction, and dispersal and analyse the impact of two different types of gene drive, a Driving Y chromosome and a homing construct targeting an essential gene. We find in all cases a sufficiently strong Driving Y will go to fixation and the population will be eliminated, except in the one life history scenario (reproduction and mating in patches followed by dispersal) where low density leads to increased inbreeding, in which case the population persists indefinitely, tending to either a stable equilibrium or a limit cycle. These dynamics arise because Driving Y males have reduced mating success, particularly at low densities, due to having fewer sisters to mate with. Increased inbreeding at low densities can also prevent a homing construct from eliminating a population. For both types of drive, if there is strong inbreeding depression, then the population cannot be rescued by inbreeding and it is eliminated. These results highlight the potentially critical role that low-density-induced inbreeding and inbreeding depression (and, by extension, other sources of Allee effects) can have on the eventual impact of a gene drive on a target population.

AB  - Most mechanistic predator-prey modelling has involved either parameterization from process rate data or inverse modelling. Here, we take a median road: we aim at identifying the potential benefits of combining datasets, when both population growth and predation processes are viewed as stochastic. We fit a discrete-time, stochastic predator-prey model of the Leslie type to simulated time series of densities and kill rate data. Our model has both environmental stochasticity in the growth rates and interaction stochasticity, i.e., a stochastic functional response. We examine what the kill rate data brings to the quality of the estimates, and whether estimation is possible (for various time series lengths) solely with time series of population counts or biomass data. Both Bayesian and frequentist estimation are performed, providing multiple ways to check model identifiability. The Fisher Information Matrix suggests that models with and without kill rate data are all identifiable, although correlations remain between parameters that belong to the same functional form. However, our results show that if the attractor is a fixed point in the absence of stochasticity, identifying parameters in practice requires kill rate data as a complement to the time series of population densities, due to the relatively flat likelihood. Only noisy limit cycle attractors can be identified directly from population count data (as in inverse modelling), although even in this case, adding kill rate data including in small amounts - can make the estimates much more precise. Overall, we show that under process stochasticity in interaction rates, interaction data might be essential to obtain identifiable dynamical models for multiple species. These results may extend to other biotic interactions than predation, for which similar models combining interaction rates and population counts could be developed. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - There are many mechanisms that hosts can evolve to defend against parasites, two of which are resistance and tolerance. These defences often have different evolutionary behaviours, and it is important to consider how each individual mechanism may respond to changes in environment. In particular, host defence through tolerance is predicted to be unlikely to lead to variation, despite many observations of diversity in both animal and plant systems. Hence understanding the drivers of diversity in host defence and parasite virulence is vital for predicting future evolutionary changes in infectious disease dynamics. It has been suggested that heterogeneous environments might generally promote diversity, but the effect of temporal fluctuations has received little attention theoretically or empirically, and there has been no examination of how temporal fluctuations affects the evolution of host tolerance. In this study, we use a mathematical model to investigate the evolution of host tolerance in a temporally fluctuating environment. We show that investment in tolerance increases in more variable environments, giving qualitatively different evolutionary behaviours when compared to resistance. Once seasonality is introduced evolutionary branching though tolerance can occur and create diversity within the population, although potentially only temporarily. This branching behaviour arises due to the emergence of a negative feedback with the maximum infected density on a cycle, which is strongest when the infected population is large. This work reinforces the qualitative differences between tolerance and resistance evolution, but also provides theoretical evidence for the theory that heterogeneous environments promote host-parasite diversity, hence constant environment assumptions may omit important evolutionary outcomes.

AB  - Mate choice through direct assortment on heritable traits, assortative mating (AM), is predicted in theory to inflate the genetic variance in a population and the correlation between relatives. Here, we revisit the theory of AM, first established in the landmark 1918 paper from RA Fisher, and provide new theory and analytical results. In particular, we shed light on inconsistencies in the literature regarding the correlation between double first cousins under AM and provide a solution. We derive new theory for AM due to X-chromosome loci. We show in the latter case that the inflation of genetic variance induced under AM is twice as large in females compared to males. These two theoretical contributions are verified and illustrated through simulations. We also provide a more general unified framework for the correlation between relatives in a non-inbred population. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - We consider two individuals sampled from an age-structured population, and derive the probability that these have a parent-offspring relationship. Such probabilities play an important role in the recently proposed close-kin mark-recapture methods. The probability is decomposed into three terms. The first is the probability of the parent being alive, the second term involves the mechanism by which individuals are sampled, and the third term is a contribution from the observed age of the parent. A stable age distribution in the population is assumed, and we provide an expression for how this distribution is perturbed by the information that an individual has given birth at a particular time point in the past or in the future. Calculations are performed from the perspective of the offspring, but we also make comparison to the situation where the perspective is put on the parent. Although the resulting probabilities are the same, the actual calculations differ, due to the asymmetry of a parent-offspring relationship. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - A problem of the analysis of the noise-induced extinction in population models with Allee effect is considered. To clarify mechanisms of the extinction, we suggest a new technique combining an analysis of the geometry of attractors and their stochastic sensitivity. For the conceptual one-dimensional discrete Ricker-type model, on the base of the bifurcation analysis, deterministic persistence zones are constructed in the space of initial states and biological parameters. It is shown that the random environmental noise can contract, and even destroy these persistence zones. A parametric analysis of the probabilistic mechanism of the noise-induced extinction in regular and chaotic zones is carried out with the help of the unified approach based on the sensitivity functions technique and confidence domains method.

AB  - The success of humans on the globe is largely supported by our cultural excellence. Our culture is cumulative, meaning that it is improved from generation to generation. Previous works have revealed that two modes of learning, individual learning and social learning, play pivotal roles in the accumulation of culture. However, under the trade-off between learning and reproduction, one's investment into learning is easily exploited by those who copy the knowledge of skillful individuals and selfishly invest more efforts in reproduction. It has been shown that in order to prevent such a breakdown, the rate of vertical transmission (i.e. transmission from parents to their offspring) of culture must be unrealistically close to one. Here we investigate what if the population is spatially structured. In particular, we hypothesize that spatial structure should favor highly cumulative culture through endogenously arising high kinship. We employ Wright's island model and assume that cultural transmission occurs within a local island. Our inclusive fitness analysis reveals combined effects of direct fitness of the actor, indirect fitness through relatives in the current generation, and indirect fitness through relatives in future generations. The magnitude of those indirect benefits is measured by intergenerational coefficients of genetic relatedness. Our result suggests that the introduction of spatial structure raises the stationary level of culture in the population, but that the extent of its improvement compared with a well-mixed population is marginal unless spatial localization is extreme. Overall, our model implies that we need an alternative mechanism to explain highly cumulative culture of modern humans. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Optimal foraging is one of the major predictive theories of predator foraging behavior. However, how an optimally foraging predator affects the coexistence of competing prey is not well understood either in a constant or variable environment, especially for multiple prey species. We study the impact of optimal foraging on prey coexistence using an annual plant model, with and without annual variation in seed germination. Seed predators are modeled using Charnov's model of adaptive diet choice. Our results reveal that multiple prey species can coexist because of this type of predator, and that their effect is not greatly modified by environmental variation. However, in diverse communities, the requirements for coexistence by optimal foraging alone are very restrictive. Optimally foraging predators can have a strong equalizing effect on their prey by creating a competition-predation trade-off. Thus, their main role in promoting diversity may be to reduce species-average fitness differences, making it easier for other mechanisms, such as the storage effect, to allow multiple species to coexist. Like previous models, our model showed that when germination rates vary, the storage effect from competition promotes coexistence. Our results also show that optimally foraging predators can generate a negative storage effect from predation, undermining coexistence, but that this effect will be minor whenever predators commonly differentiate their prey.

AB  - Invasions are one of the most easily identified spatial phenomena in ecology, and have inspired a rich variety of theories for ecologists' and naturalists' consideration. However, a number of arguments over the sensitivities of invasion rates to stochasticity, density-dependence, dimension, and discreteness persist in the literature.
   The standard mathematical approach to invasions is based on Fisher's analysis of traveling waves solutions for the spread of an advantageous allele. In this paper, we exploit an alternative theory based on Ellner's premise that species invasions are best interpreted not as waves, but as random walks, and that the discreteness of living organisms is fundamentally important. Using a density-dependent invasion model in a stationary environment with indivisible (atomic) individuals where reproduction and dispersal are stochastic and independent, we show 4 key properties of Ellner's invasions previously suggested by simulation analysis: (1) greater spatial dispersal stochasticity quickens invasions, (2) greater demographic stochasticity slows invasions, (3) negative density-dependence slows invasions, and (4) greater temporal dispersal stochasticity quickens invasions. We prove the first three results by using generating functions and stochastic-dominance methods to rank furthest-forward dispersal distributions. The fourth result is proven in the special case of atomless theory, but remains an open conjecture in atomic theory. In addition, we explain why, unlike atomless invasions, an infinitely wide atomic invasion in two-dimensions can travel faster than a finite-width invasion and a one-dimensional invasion. The paper concludes with a classification of invasion dynamics based on dispersal kernel tails. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Recent improvement in the quality of genetic data obtained from extinct human populations and their ancestors encourages searching for answers to basic questions regarding human population history. The most common and successful are model-based approaches, in which genetic data are compared to the data obtained from the assumed demography model. Using such approach, it is possible to either validate or adjust assumed demography. Model fit to data can be obtained based on reverse-time coalescent simulations or forward-time simulations. In this paper we introduce a computational method based on mathematical equation that allows obtaining joint distributions of pairs of individuals under a specified demography model, each of them characterized by a genetic variant at a chosen locus. The two individuals are randomly sampled from either the same or two different populations. The model assumes three types of demographic events (split, merge and migration). Populations evolve according to the time continuous Moran model with drift and Markov-process mutation. This latter process is described by the Lyapunov-type equation introduced by O'Brien and generalized in our previous works. Application of this equation constitutes an original contribution. In the result section of the paper we present sample applications of our model to both simulated and literature-based demographies. Among other we include a study of the Slays-Baits-Finns genetic relationship, in which we model split and migrations between the Baits and Slays. We also include another example that involves the migration rates between farmers and hunters-gatherers, based on modern and ancient DNA samples. This latter process was previously studied using coalescent simulations. Our results are in general agreement with the previous method, which provides validation of our approach. Although our model is not an alternative to simulation methods in the practical sense, it provides an algorithm to compute pairwise distributions of alleles, in the case of haploid non-recombining loci such as mitochondrial and Y-chromosome loci in humans.

AB  - Most population genetics studies have their origins in a Wright-Fisher or some closely related fixed population model in which each individual randomly chooses its ancestor. Populations which vary in size with time are typically modelled via a coalescent derived from Wright-Fisher, but use a nonlinear time-scaling driven by a deterministically imposed population growth. An alternate, arguably more realistic approach, and one which we take here, is to allow the population size to vary stochastically via a Galton-Watson branching process.
   We study genetic drift in a population consisting of a number of distinct allele types in which each allele type evolves as an independent Galton-Watson branching process. We find the dynamics of the population is determined by a single parameter kappa(0) = (2m(0)/sigma(2)) log lambda, where m(0) is the initial population size, lambda is the mean number of offspring per individual; and sigma(2) is the variance of the number of offspring. For 0 less than or similar to kappa(0) << 1, the dynamics are close to those of Wright-Fisher, with the added property that the population is prone to extinction. For kappa(0) >> 1 allele frequencies and ancestral lineages are stable and individual alleles do not fix throughout the population. The existence of a rapid changeover regime at kappa(0)approximate to 1 enables estimates to be made, together with confidence intervals, of the time and population size of the era of mitochondrial Eve.

AB  - Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne viral disease with 100 million people infected annually. A novel strategy for dengue control uses the bacterium Wolbachia to invade dengue vector Aedes mosquitoes. As the impact of environmental heterogeneity on Wolbachia spread dynamics in natural areas has been rarely quantified, we develop a model of differential equations for which the environmental conditions switch randomly between two regimes. We find some striking phenomena that random regime transitions could drive Wolbachia to extinction from certain initial states confirmed Wolbachia fixation in homogeneous environments, and mosquito releasing facilitates Wolbachia invasion more effectively when the regimes transit frequently. By superimposing the phase spaces of the ODE systems defined in each regime, we identify the threshold curves below which Wolbachia invades the whole population, which extends the theory of threshold infection frequency to stochastic environments.

Our analysis provides an analytical framework that unifies substantial parts of previous work in terms of exact identity by descent (IBD) and identity by state (IBS) recursions. We provide exact conditions under which two structured haploid and diploid populations are equivalent, and some sufficient conditions under which a dioecious diploid population can be treated as a monoecious diploid one. The IBD recursions are used for computing local and metapopulation inbreeding and coancestry effective population sizes and for predictions of several types of fixation indices over different time horizons.

AB  - When models of quantitative genetic variation are built from population genetic first principles, several assumptions are often made. One of the most important assumptions is that traits are controlled by many genes of small effect. This leads to a prediction of a Gaussian trait distribution in the population, via the Central Limit Theorem. Since these biological assumptions are often unknown or untrue, we characterized how finite numbers of loci or large mutational effects can impact the sampling distribution of a quantitative trait. To do so, we developed a neutral coalescent-based framework, allowing us to gain a detailed understanding of how number of loci and the underlying mutational model impacts the distribution of a quantitative trait. Through both analytical theory and simulation we found the normality assumption was highly sensitive to the details of the mutational process, with the greatest discrepancies arising when the number of loci was small or the mutational kernel was heavy-tailed. In particular, skewed mutational effects will produce skewed trait distributions and fat-tailed mutational kernels result in multimodal sampling distributions, even for traits controlled by a large number of loci. Since selection models and robust neutral models may produce qualitatively similar sampling distributions, we advise extra caution should be taken when interpreting model-based results for poorly understood systems of quantitative traits.

AB  - Floral displays are functionally and genetically integrated structures, so modifications to display will likely affect multiple fitness components (pleiotropy), including pollen export and self-pollination, and therefore selfing rate. Consequently, the great diversities of floral displays and of mating systems found among angiosperms have likely co-evolved. I extend previous models of mating system evolution to determine how pleiotropy that links viability (e.g., probability of survival to reproduction) and the allocation of pollen for export and selfing affects the evolution of selflng, outcrossing, and in particular, mixed mating. I show that the outcome depends on how pollen shifts from being exported, unused, or used for selfing. Furthermore, pleiotropy that affects viability can explain observations not addressed by previous theory, including the evolution of mixed mating despite high inbreeding depression in the absence of pollen-limitation. Therefore, pleiotropy may play a key role in explaining selfing rates for such species that exhibit otherwise enigmatic mating systems. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

KW  - ALGORITHM
AB  - The reconstruction of pedigrees from genetic marker data is relevant to a wide range of applications. Likelihood-based approaches aim to find the pedigree structure that gives the highest probability to the observed data. Existing methods either entail an exhaustive search and are hence restricted to small numbers of individuals, or they take a more heuristic approach and deliver a solution that will probably have high likelihood but is not guaranteed to be optimal. By encoding the pedigree learning problem as an integer linear program we can exploit efficient optimisation algorithms to construct pedigrees guaranteed to have maximal likelihood for the standard situation where we have complete marker data at unlinked loci and segregation of genes from parents to offspring is Mendelian. Previous work demonstrated efficient reconstruction of pedigrees of up to about 100 individuals. The modified method that we present here is not so restricted: we demonstrate its applicability with simulated data on a real human pedigree structure of over 1600 individuals. It also compares well with a very competitive approximate approach in terms of solving time and accuracy. In addition to identifying a maximum likelihood pedigree, we can obtain any number of pedigrees in decreasing order of likelihood. This is useful for assessing the uncertainty of a maximum likelihood solution and permits model averaging over high likelihood pedigrees when this would be appropriate. More importantly, when the solution is not unique, as will often be the case for large pedigrees, it enables investigation into the properties of maximum likelihood pedigree estimates which has not been possible up to now. Crucially, we also have a means of assessing the behaviour of other approximate approaches which all aim to find a maximum likelihood solution. Our approach hence allows us to properly address the question of whether a reasonably high likelihood solution that is easy to obtain is practically as useful as a guaranteed maximum likelihood solution. The efficiency of our method on such large problems bodes well for extensions beyond the standard setting where some pedigree members may be latent, genotypes may be measured with error and markers may be linked.

AB  - Temporal environmental variation is a leading hypothesis for the coexistence of desert annual plants. Environmental variation is hypothesized to cause species-specific patterns of variation in germination, which then generates the storage effect coexistence mechanism. However, it has never been shown how sufficient species differences in germination patterns for multispecies coexistence can arise from a shared fluctuating environment. Here we show that nonlinear germination responses to a single fluctuating physical environmental factor can lead to sufficient differences between species in germination pattern for the storage effect to yield coexistence of multiple species. We derive these nonlinear germination responses from experimental data on the effects of varying soil moisture duration. Although these nonlinearities lead to strong species asymmetries in germination patterns, the relative nonlinearity coexistence mechanism is minor compared with the storage effect. However, these asymmetries mean that the storage effect can be negative for some species, which then only persist in the face of interspecific competition through average fitness advantages. This work shows how a low dimensional physical environment can nevertheless stabilize multispecies coexistence when the species have different nonlinear responses to common conditions, as supported by our experimental data.

AB  - Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) is often controlled through culling of poultry. Compensating farmers for culled chickens or ducks facilitates effective culling and control of HPAI. However, ensuing price shifts can create incentives that alter the disease dynamics of HPAI. Farmers control certain aspects of the dynamics by setting a farm size, implementing infection control measures, and determining the age at which poultry are sent to market. Their decisions can be influenced by the market price of poultry which can, in turn, be set by policy makers during an HPAI outbreak. Here, we integrate these economic considerations into an epidemiological model in which epidemiological parameters are determined by an outside agent (the farmer) to maximize profit from poultry sales. Our model exhibits a diversity of behaviors which are sensitive to (i) the ability to identify infected poultry, (ii) the average price of infected poultry, (iii) the basic reproductive number of avian influenza, (iv) the effect of culling on the market price of poultry, (v) the effect of market price on farm size, and (vi) the effect of poultry density on disease transmission. We find that under certain market and epidemiological conditions, culling can increase farm size and the total number of HPAI infections. Our model helps to inform the optimization of public health outcomes that best weigh the balance between public health risk and beneficial economic outcomes for farmers. (c) 2013 The Authors.

AB  - The variance effective population size (N-ev) is a key concept in population biology, because it quantifies the microevolutionary process of random genetic drift, and understanding the characteristics of N-ev is thus of central importance. Current formulas for Nev for populations with overlapping generations weight age classes according to their reproductive values (i.e. reflecting the contribution of genes from separate age classes to the population growth) to obtain a correct measure of genetic drift when computing the variance of the allele frequency change over time. In this paper, we examine the effect of applying different weights to the age classes using a novel analytical approach for exploring N-ev. We consider a haploid organism with overlapping generations and populations of increasing, declining, or constant expected size and stochastic variation with respect to the number of individuals in the separate age classes. We define Nov, as a function of how the age classes are weighted, and of the span between the two points in time, when measuring allele frequency change. With this model, time profiles for N-ev can be calculated for populations with various life histories and with fluctuations in life history composition, using different weighting schemes. We examine analytically and by simulations when Nei, using a weighting scheme with respect to reproductive contribution of separate age classes, accurately reflect the variance of the allele frequency change due to genetic drift over time. We show that the discrepancy of N-ev, calculated with reproductive values as weights, compared to when individuals are weighted equally, tends to a constant when the time span between the two measurements increases. This constant is zero only for a population with a constant expected population size. Our results confirm that the effect of ignoring overlapping generations, when empirically assessing Nell from allele frequency shifts, gets smaller as the time interval between samples increases. Our model has empirical applications including assessment of (i) time intervals necessary to permit ignoring the effect of overlapping generations for N-ev estimation by means of the temporal method, and (ii) effects of life table manipulation on N-ev over varying time periods.

AB  - A phase -type distribution is the time to absorption in a continuous- or discrete -time Markov chain. Phasetype distributions can be used as a general framework to calculate key properties of the standard coalescent model and many of its extensions. Here, the 'phases' in the phase -type distribution correspond to states in the ancestral process. For example, the time to the most recent common ancestor and the total branch length are phase -type distributed. Furthermore, the site frequency spectrum follows a multivariate discrete phase -type distribution and the joint distribution of total branch lengths in the two -locus coalescent -withrecombination model is multivariate phase -type distributed. In general, phase -type distributions provide a powerful mathematical framework for coalescent theory because they are analytically tractable using matrix manipulations. The purpose of this review is to explain the phase -type theory and demonstrate how the theory can be applied to derive basic properties of coalescent models. These properties can then be used to obtain insight into the ancestral process, or they can be applied for statistical inference. In particular, we show the relation between classical first -step analysis of coalescent models and phase -type calculations. We also show how reward transformations in phase -type theory lead to easy calculation of covariances and correlation coefficients between e.g. tree height, tree length, external branch length, and internal branch length. Furthermore, we discuss how these quantities can be used for statistical inference based on estimating equations. Providing an alternative to previous work based on the Laplace transform, we derive likelihoods for small -size coalescent trees based on phase -type theory. Overall, our main aim is to demonstrate that phasetype distributions provide a convenient general set of tools to understand aspects of coalescent models that are otherwise difficult to derive. Throughout the review, we emphasize the versatility of the phase -type framework, which is also illustrated by our accompanying R -code. All our analyses and figures can be reproduced from code available on GitHub.

AB  - Mathematical models of genetic evolution often come in pairs, connected by a so-called duality relation. The most seminal example are the Wright-Fisher diffusion and the Kingman coalescent, where the former describes the stochastic evolution of neutral allele frequencies in a large population forwards in time, and the latter describes the genetic ancestry of randomly sampled individuals from the population backwards in time. As well as providing a richer description than either model in isolation, duality often yields equations satisfied by quantities of interest. We employ the so-called Bernoulli factory - a celebrated tool in simulation-based computing - to derive duality relations for broad classes of genetics models. As concrete examples, we present Wright-Fisher diffusions with general drift functions, and Allen-Cahn equations with general, nonlinear forcing terms. The drift and forcing functions can be interpreted as the action of frequency-dependent selection. To our knowledge, this work is the first time a connection has been drawn between Bernoulli factories and duality in models of population genetics.

AB  - Although cooperative hunting is widespread among animals, its benefits are unclear. At low frequencies, cooperative hunting may allow predators to escape competition and access bigger prey that could not be caught by a lone cooperative predator. Cooperative hunting is a more successful strategy when it is common, but its spread can result in overhunting big prey, which may have a lower per -capita growth rate than small prey. We construct a one -predator species, two -prey species model in which predators either learn to hunt small prey alone or learn to hunt big prey cooperatively. Predators first learn vertically from parents, then horizontally (i.e. socially) from random individuals or siblings. After horizontal transmission, they hunt with their learning partner if both are cooperative, and otherwise they hunt alone. Cooperative hunting cannot evolve when initially rare unless predators (a) interact with siblings, or (b) horizontally transmit the cooperative behavior to potential hunting partners. Whereas competition for small prey favors cooperative hunting when this cooperation is initially rare, the frequency of cooperative hunting cannot reach 100% unless big prey is abundant. Furthermore, a mutant that increases horizontal learning can invade if cooperative hunting is present, but not at 100%, because horizontal learning allows pairs of predators to have the same strategy. Our results reveal that the interactions between prey availability, social learning, and degree of cooperation among predators may have important effects on ecosystems.

AB  - Parentage exclusion probability is usually calculated to evaluate the informativeness of a set of markers for, and the statistical power of, a parentage analysis. Equations for parentage exclusion probability have been derived in various scenarios such as paternity exclusion when maternity is known or unknown or when candidate males are unrelated or loosely related (being from the same subpopulation) to the father. All previous work assumes a diploid species. Although marker-based parentage analyses have been conducted in haploidiploid species (such as ants, bees and wasps) for diploid offspring at the individual level or haploid offspring at the class level, rigorously derived formulations of parentage exclusion probability for haploid offspring at the individual level are lacking, which prevents the precise evaluation of the informativeness for and the statistical power of a parentage analysis. In this study we derive equations for the exclusion probability of maternity of a haploid male when multiple mother candidates (workers or queens) are unrelated or fullsibs to the mother. The usefulness of the equations is exemplified by numerical examples, and the results are discussed in the context of the study of worker reproductivity in eusocial haplodiploid species. The results are especially valuable for an optimal experimental design in determining sampling intensities (e.g. number of markers and number of individuals) to achieve satisfactory statistical power of a parentage analysis in investigating workers' reproductivity in eusocial haplodiploid species.Crown Copyright & COPY; 2023 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Recombination is a powerful evolutionary process that shapes the genetic diversity observed in the populations of many species. Reconstructing genealogies in the presence of recombination from sequencing data is a very challenging problem, as this relies on mutations having occurred on the correct lineages in order to detect the recombination and resolve the ordering of coalescence events in the local trees. We investigate the probability of reconstructing the true topology of ancestral recombination graphs (ARGs) under the coalescent with recombination and gene conversion. We explore how sample size and mutation rate affect the inherent uncertainty in reconstructed ARGs, which sheds light on the theoretical limitations of ARG reconstruction methods. We illustrate our results using estimates of evolutionary rates for several organisms; in particular, we find that for parameter values that are realistic for SARS-CoV-2, the probability of reconstructing genealogies that are close to the truth is low.

AB  - Dispersal can enable access to resources in new locations. Consequently, traits that govern dispersal probability and dispersal distance may impact an individual's ability to acquire resources. However, spatial variation in the quality or quantity of resources may mediate potential adaptive benefits of novel dispersal traits. Ecological traits (i.e., those that determine how an individual processes resources) will also, by definition, affect how an individual interacts with the resource landscape. In a spatially heterogeneous environment, this creates potential for evolutionary feedbacks between dispersal-related traits and ecological traits. For example, dispersal may introduce individuals to novel resources, at which point there may be selection for local adaptation of ecological traits. Conversely, an individual's ability to utilize different resource types may determine how dispersal impacts fitness. Here, we develop an individual-based model to investigate co-evolution of dispersal and ecological traits in a landscape where multiple resources vary independently across space. We find that: (1) resource specialists can emerge and tend to evolve dispersal strategies suited to the structure of their preferred resource type and (2) generalists, when they emerge, tend to possess intermediate dispersal strategies. Lastly, we note that the effect of dispersal on the evolution of the ecological trait is weaker than vice versa and, as a result, appreciable heterogeneity in the abundance of resources across a landscape will likely obscure a signal of co-evolution. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Predicting the adaptation of populations to a changing environment is crucial to assess the impact of human activities on biodiversity. Many theoretical studies have tackled this issue by modeling the evolution of quantitative traits subject to stabilizing selection around an optimal phenotype, whose value is shifted continuously through time. In this context, the population fate results from the equilibrium distribution of the trait, relative to the moving optimum. Such a distribution may vary with the shape of selection, the system of reproduction, the number of loci, the mutation kernel or their interactions. Here, we develop a methodology that provides quantitative measures of population maladaptation and potential of survival directly from the entire profile of the phenotypic distribution, without any a priori on its shape. We investigate two different systems of reproduction (asexual and infinitesimal sexual models of inheritance), with various forms of selection. In particular, we recover that fitness functions such that selection weakens away from the optimum lead to evolutionary tipping points, with an abrupt collapse of the population when the speed of environmental change is too high. Our unified framework allows deciphering the mechanisms that lead to this phenomenon. More generally, it allows discussing similarities and discrepancies between the two systems of reproduction, which are ultimately explained by different constraints on the evolution of the phenotypic variance. We demonstrate that the mean fitness in the population crucially depends on the shape of the selection function in the infinitesimal sexual model, in contrast with the asexual model. In the asexual model, we also investigate the effect of the mutation kernel and we show that kernels with higher kurtosis tend to reduce maladaptation and improve fitness, especially in fast changing environments.(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - In recent years, the importance of describing mortality at the limits of the life span has led to a number of relevant and controversial studies. Whereas considerable efforts have been devoted to collecting data and estimating models on the oldest-old individuals, the testing of statistical confidence about the conclusions of analyses at extreme ages has been largely neglected. How certain can we be in saying that the risk of dying increases, levels out, or, paradoxically, decreases over age 105? Can we recognize particular mortality age patterns at such high ages? In this paper, it is shown that very little can be confidently asserted about mortality at extreme ages. Instead of analyzing actual data, we perform a series of simulation studies mimicking actual scenarios from controlled mechanisms. Our findings are thus robust with respect to factors such as particular observation schemes, heterogeneity, and data quality issues. Given the sample sizes currently available and the levels of mortality experienced in present populations, we show that before age 110, only a Gompertzian increase of mortality may be detected. Afterwards a plateau will be regularly recognized as the most suitable pattern, regardless of the complexity of the true underlying mortality. (C) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - We study a finite population of individuals evolving through mutation and selection. We generalize the Eigen quasispecies model to a finite population with the Moran model. This model also presents an asymptotic phase transition, and a proper definition of the critical parameter is discussed. We retrieve the same expression for the error threshold appearing in the Eigen model along with a correction term due to the finiteness of the population. To achieve this, we estimate the average lifetime of master sequences and find it grows like an exponential in the size of the population. Our technique consists in bounding from above and below the number of master sequences in the Moran model by two simpler birth and death chains. The expectation of this lifetime is then computed with the help of explicit formulas which are in turn expanded with Laplace method. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - We consider Bazykin's model to address harvesting induced stability exchanges through bifurcation analysis. We examine the existence of hydra effects and analyze the stock pattern under predator harvesting. Prey harvesting cannot produce hydra effects in our model, whereas predator harvesting may cause multiple hydra effects. Our study reveals that type II response function and mutual interference among predators jointly induce multiple hydra effects and bistability. Bifurcations such as single Hopf-bifurcation, multiple Hopf-bifurcations and multiple saddle-node bifurcations appear for increasing harvesting rate on the predators. However, over-exploitation of the predators cannot generate any such bifurcation in our study. In simulations, the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) exists at a globally stable state. When predator is culled under increasing effort, basin of attraction of the equilibrium corresponding to the higher predator stock gets expanded, which alternatively is in favor of stock benefit for predators. The ecological theory developed in this study might be useful to understand conservation policy and fishery management. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - An early question in evolutionary theory asked why frequency distributions of taxonomic group sizes exhibit "hollow curves" so frequently. An answer to this question was provided by G. Udny Yule's seminal contribution introducing a discrete model for those distributions. But Yule observed that the fit of his model to observed distributions was sometimes imperfect, in particular for the class of reptiles. The present study introduces a multi-epoch extension of the discrete Yule model that accounts for unobserved extinction of ancient lineages. The multi-epoch model is described as a Pelya urn embedded in a continuous-time branching process with an harmonic sequence of diversification rates. The main results include equivalent descriptions of multi-epoch models, their probability distributions, expected values, tail behavior and a self-similarity property. As an illustration of the theory, the multi-epoch model is applied to study the taxonomic diversity of reptile species, and provides a much better fit to the observed distribution of species than the original discrete Yule model.

AB  - Spatiotemporal variations of natural selection may influence the evolution of various features of organisms such as local adaptation or specialisation. This article develops a method for inferring how selection varies between locations and between generations from phenotypic data. It is assumed that generations are non-overlapping and that individuals reproduce by selfing or asexually. A quantitative genetics model taking account of the effects of stabilising natural selection, the environment and mutation on phenotypic means and variances is developed. Explicit results on the evolution of populations are derived and used to develop a Bayesian inference method. The latter is applied to simulated data and to data from a wheat participatory plant breeding programme. It has some ability to infer evolutionary parameters, but estimates may be sensitive to prior distributions, for example when phenotypic time series are short and when environmental effects are large. In such cases, sensitivity to prior distributions may be reported or more data may be collected. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Size inequality has been considered a key feature of plant population structure with impacts on ecosystem functions. In forest ecosystems, studies examining the relationship between tree size inequality and stand productivity have produced mixed outcomes. These studies found positive, neutral or negative relationships and discussed how this could be influenced by competition for light between trees (e.g. light interception efficiency), but far less attention has been paid to the role played by tree ontogenetic growth. In this article, we present a simple mathematical model that predicts the basal area growth of a two-strata stand as a function of tree basal areas and asymmetric competition. Comparing the growth of this stand to the growth of a spatially homogeneous one-stratum stand and a spatially heterogeneous one-stratum stand, we show that higher growth of the two-strata stand is achieved for concave shape, increasing functions of ontogenetic growth and for low intensities of absolute size-asymmetric competition. We also demonstrate that the difference in growth between the two-strata stand and the one-stratum stands depends on tree size inequality, mean tree basal area and total basal area in the two-strata stand. We finally found that the relationships between tree size inequality and productivity can vary from positive to negative and even non-monotonous. However, we highlight that negative relationships may be more frequent. As a conclusion, our results indicate that ontogenetic growth can have a major impact on the form and the magnitude of the size inequality productivity relationship. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - We propose a stochastic model of cultural evolution in a hunter-gatherer population that is subdivided into demes (subpopulations) of variable size and distributed over a finite or infinite number of sites. We assume a skill acquirable by either social or individual learning, such as the know how for positive niche construction, which raises the carrying capacity of a site. We further assume a positive feedback between the number of individuals in a deme with the skill and the size of that deme, which entails that, for most of the time, a deme will either be small and include few skilled individuals or large and include many skilled individuals. Our principal goal is to examine the effect of the migration rate among sites, a measure of their connectedness, on the frequency and duration of shifts to the large-demeimany-skilled-individuals condition that simultaneously involve many demes. We find that the frequency of these concerted shifts is maximized at an intermediate migration rate, whereas their mean duration is monotone increasing in the migration rate. Finally, we use these theoretical predictions to interpret the Still Bay and Howiesons Poort industries, which are believed to have had spatially-synchronous and widespread distributions of relatively short duration in southern Africa.

AB  - Social learning not only takes the form of random copying of other individuals, but also involves learners' choice of what to learn or from whom to learn. Best-of-k learning refers to a kind of success-biased social learning strategy in which a learner randomly samples k exemplars from the population and imitates the most "successful" one, or the one gaining the highest payoff. While it is intuitive that best-of-k learning can promote the spread of superior variants and thereby enable cumulative cultural evolution, a previous mathematical analysis has shown that it may sometimes result in maladaptive cultural evolution when the payoffs associated with cultural variants vary stochastically. If so, best-of-k learners may be selectively disfavored and in the long run replaced by unbiased learners, who simply copy someone chosen at random. Here we develop new mathematical models that are more simplified and mathematically tractable than the previous model to achieve a fuller analysis of cultural and evolutionary dynamics involving best-of-k learning and stochastic payoffs. We find that best-of-k learning, unlike unbiased learning, can facilitate the invasion of an on average inferior variant that sometimes gives a very high payoff, destabilize a population fixed with a variant that is on average superior but occasionally results in a very low payoff, and maintain cultural polymorphism at equilibrium. Considering gene-culture coevolution of learning rules and cultural variants, under the assumption that social learning is always faithful, it is shown that a population of best-of-k learners at the culturally polymorphic state can always be invaded by unbiased learners and eventually converges to a culturally monomorphic state. Nonetheless, we show that best-of-k learning can be stable against invasion by unbiased learning if social learning is sometimes combined with individual learning. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The Kingman coalescent is a commonly used model in genetics, which is often justified with reference to the Wright-Fisher (WF) model. Current proofs of convergence of WF and other models to the Kingman coalescent assume a constant sample size. However, sample sizes have become quite large in human genetics. Therefore, we develop a convergence theory that allows the sample size to increase with population size. If the haploid population size is N and the sample size is N1/3-epsilon, epsilon > 0, we prove that Wright-Fisher genealogies involve at most a single binary merger in each generation with probability converging to 1 in the limit of large N. Single binary merger or no merger in each generation of the genealogy implies that the Kingman partition distribution is obtained exactly. If the sample size is N1/3-epsilon, Wright-Fisher genealogies may involve simultaneous binary mergers in a single generation but do not involve triple mergers in the large N limit. The asymptotic theory is verified using numerical calculations. Variable population sizes are handled algorithmically. It is found that even distant bottlenecks can increase the probability of triple mergers as well as simultaneous binary mergers in WF genealogies. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Despite actions to manage sustainably tropical Pacific Ocean reef fisheries, managers have faced failures and frustrations because of unpredicted mass mortality events triggered by climate variability. The consequences of these events on the long-term population dynamics of living resources need to be better understood for better management decisions. Here, we use a giant clam (Tridacna maxima) spatially explicit population model to compare the efficiency of several management strategies under various scenarios of natural mortality, including mass mortality due to climatic anomalies. The model was parameterized by in situ estimations of growth and mortality and fishing effort, and was validated by historical and new in situ surveys of giant clam stocks in two French Polynesia lagoons. Projections on the long run (100 years) suggested that the best management strategy was a decrease of fishing pressure through quota implementation, regardless of the mortality regime considered. In contrast, increasing the minimum legal size of catch and closing areas to fishing were less efficient. When high mortality occurred due to climate variability, the efficiency of all management scenarios decreased markedly. Simulating El Nifio Southern Oscillation event by adding temporal autocorrelation in natural mortality rates increased the natural variability of stocks, and also decreased the efficiency of management. These results highlight the difficulties that managers in small Pacific islands can expect in the future in the face of global warming, climate anomalies and new mass mortalities.

AB  - Network structure is a dominant feature of many biological systems, both at the cellular level and within natural populations. Advances in genotype and gene expression screening made over the last few decades have permitted the reconstruction of these networks. However, resolution to a single model estimate will generally not be possible, leaving open the question of the appropriate method of formal statistical inference. The nonstandard structure of the problem precludes most traditional statistical methodologies. Alternatively, a Bayesian approach provides a natural methodology for formal inference. Construction of a posterior density on the space of network structures allows formal inference regarding features of network structure using specific marginal posterior distributions.
   An information theoretic approach to this problem will be described, based on the Minimum Description Length principle. This leads to a Bayesian inference model based on the information content of data rather than on more commonly used probabilistic models. The approach is applied to the problem of pedigree reconstruction based on genotypic data. Using this application, it is shown how the MDL approach is able to provide a truly objective control for model complexity.
   A two-cohort model is used for a simulation study. The MDL approach is compared to COLONY-2, a well known pedigree reconstruction application. The study highlights the problem of genotyping error modeling. COLONY-2 requires prior error rate estimates, and its accuracy proves to be highly sensitive to these estimates. In contrast, the MDL approach does not require prior error rate estimates, and is able to accurately adjust for genotyping error across the range of models considered. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - For curable infectious diseases, public health strategies such as treatment can effectively shorten an individual's infectious period, and thus limit their role in transmission. However, because treatment effectively eliminates antigen impingement, these types of control strategies may also paradoxically impair the development of adaptive immune responses. For sexually transmitted Chlamydia trachomatis infections, this latter effect has been coined the arrested immunity hypothesis, and is discussed to carry significant epidemiological implications for those individuals who return to similar sexual networks with similar sexual behavior. Here, we examine the effect of antibiotic treatment on the spread of Chlamydia infection through a simple immunoepidemiological framework that characterizes the population as a collection of dynamically evolving individuals in small, paradigmatic networks. Within each individual there is an explicit representation of pathogen replication, accumulation and persistence of an immune response, followed by a gradual waning of that response once the infection is cleared. Individuals are then nested in networks, allowing the variability in the life history of their infection to be functions of both individual immune dynamics as well as their position in the network. Model results suggest that the timing and coverage of treatment are important contributors to the development of immunity and reinfection. In particular, the impact of treatment on the spread of infection between individuals can be beneficial, have no effect, or be deleterious depending on who is treated and when. Although we use sexually transmitted Chlamydia infection as an example, the observed results arise endogenously from a basic model structure, and thus warrant consideration to understanding the interaction of infection, treatment, and spread of other infectious, diseases.

AB  - The matching algorithm in a dynamic marriage market model is described in this first of two companion papers. Iterative Proportional Fitting is used to find a marriage function (an age distribution of new marriages for both sexes), in a stable reference population, that is consistent with the one-sex age distributions of new marriages, and includes age preference. The one-sex age distributions (which are the marginals of the two-sex distribution) are based on the Picrate model, and age preference on a normal distribution, both of which may be adjusted by choice of parameter values. For a population that is perturbed from the reference state, the total number of new marriages is found as the harmonic mean of target totals for men and women obtained by applying reference population marriage rates to the perturbed population. The marriage function uses the age preference function, assumed to be the same for the reference and the perturbed populations, to distribute the total number of new marriages. The marriage function also has an availability factor that varies as the population changes with time, where availability depends on the supply of unmarried men and women. To simplify exposition, only first marriage is treated, and the algorithm is illustrated by application to Zambia. In the second paper, remarriage and dissolution are included. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The evolution of social behavior has been the focus of many theoretical investigations, which typically have assumed infinite populations and specific payoff structures. This paper explores the evolution of social behavior in a finite population using a general n-player game. First, we classify social behaviors in a group of n individuals based on their effects on the actor's and the social partner's payoffs, showing that in general such classification is possible only for a given composition of strategies in the group. Second, we introduce a novel transformation of payoffs in the general n-player game to formulate explicitly the effects of a social behavior on the actor's and the social partners' payoffs. Third, using the transformed payoffs, we derive the conditions for a social behavior to be favored by natural selection in a well-mixed population and in the presence of multilevel selection.

AB  - Given a labeled tree topology t , consider a population P of k leaves chosen among those of t. The clade of P is the minimal subtree of t containing P and its size is given by the number of leaves in the clade. When t is selected under the Yule or uniform distribution among the labeled topologies of size n , we study the "clade size"random variable determining closed formulas for its probability mass function, its mean, and its variance. Our calculations show that for large n the clade size tends to be smaller under the uniform model than under the Yule model, with a larger variability in the first scenario for values of k >= 5. We apply our probability formulas to investigate set-theoretic relationships between the clades of two populations in a random tree, determining how likely one clade is contained in or it is equal to the other. Our study relates to earlier calculations for the probability that under the Yule model the clade size of P equals the size of P - that is, the population P forms a monophyletic group - and extends known results for the probability that the minimal (non-trivial) clade containing a random taxon has a given size.

AB  - Consider the problem of estimating the branch lengths in a symmetric 2 -state substitution model with a known topology and a general, clock -like or star -shaped tree with three leaves. We show that the maximum likelihood estimates are analytically tractable and can be obtained from pairwise sequence comparisons. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this property does not generalize to larger state spaces, more complex models or larger trees. Our arguments are based on an enumeration of the free parameters of the model and the dimension of the minimal sufficient data vector. Our interest in this problem arose from discussions with our former colleague Freddy Bugge Christiansen.

AB  - Research shows that geographic disparities in life expectancy between leading and lagging states are increasing over time while racial disparities between Black and White Americans have been going down. In the 65+ age strata morbidity is the most common cause of death, making differences in morbidity and associated adverse health-related outcomes between advantaged and disadvantaged groups an important aspect of disparities in life expectancy at age 65 (LE65). In this study, we used Pollard's decomposition to evaluate the disease-related contributions to disparities in LE65 for two types of data with distinctly differing structures: population/registry and administrative claims. To do so, we analyzed Pollard's integral, which is exact by construction, and developed exact analytic solutions for both types of data without the need for numerical integration. The solutions are broadly applicable and easily implemented. Applying these solutions, we found that the largest relative contributions to geographic disparities in LE65 were chronic lower respiratory diseases, circulatory diseases, and lung cancer; and, to racial disparities: arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and cerebrovascular diseases. Overall, the increase in LE65 observed over 1998-2005 and 2010-2017 was primarily due to a reduction in the contributions of acute and chronic ischemic diseases; this was partially offset by increased contributions of diseases of the nervous system including dementia and Alzheimer's disease.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - The concept of individual admixture (IA) assumes that the genome of individuals is composed of alleles inherited from K ancestral populations. Each copy of each allele has the same chance qk to originate from population k, and together with the allele frequencies p in all populations at all M markers, comprises the admixture model. Here, we assume a supervised scheme, i.e. allele frequencies p are given through a reference database of size N, and q is estimated via maximum likelihood for a single sample. We study laws of large numbers and central limit theorems describing effects of finiteness of both, M and N, on the estimate of q. We recall results for the effect of finite M, and provide a central limit theorem for the effect of finite N, introduce a new way to express the uncertainty in estimates in standard barplots, give simulation results, and discuss applications in forensic genetics.

AB  - By providing additional opportunities for coalescence within families, the presence of consanguineous unions in a population reduces coalescence times relative to non-consanguineous populations. First-cousin consanguinity can take one of six forms differing in the configuration of sexes in the pedigree of the male and female cousins who join in a consanguineous union: patrilateral parallel, patrilateral cross, matrilateral parallel, matrilateral cross, bilateral parallel, and bilateral cross. Considering populations with each of the six types of first-cousin consanguinity individually and a population with a mixture of the four unilateral types, we examine coalescent models of consanguinity. We previously computed, for first-cousin consanguinity models, the mean coalescence time for X-chromosomal loci and the limiting distribution of coalescence times for autosomal loci. Here, we use the separation-of-time-scales approach to obtain the limiting distribution of coalescence times for X-chromosomal loci. This limiting distribution has an instantaneous coalescence probability that depends on the probability that a union is consanguineous; lineages that do not coalesce instantaneously coalesce according to an exponential distribution. We study the effects on the coalescence time distribution of the type of first-cousin consanguinity, showing that patrilateral-parallel and patrilateral-cross consanguinity have no effect on X-chromosomal coalescence time distributions and that matrilateral-parallel consanguinity decreases coalescence times to a greater extent than does matrilateral-cross consanguinity.

AB  - Gene gain-loss-duplication models are commonly based on continuous-time birth-death processes. Employed in a phylogenetic context, such models have been increasingly popular in studies of gene content evolution across multiple genomes. While the applications are becoming more varied and demanding, bioinformatics methods for probabilistic inference on copy numbers (or integer-valued evolutionary characters, in general) are scarce.& nbsp;& nbsp;We describe a flexible probabilistic framework for phylogenetic gain-loss-duplication models. The framework is based on a novel elementary representation by dependent random variables with well-characterized conditional distributions: binomial, Polya (negative binomial), and Poisson.& nbsp;The corresponding graphical model yields exact numerical procedures for computing the likelihood and the posterior distribution of ancestral copy numbers. The resulting algorithms take quadratic time in the total number of copies. In addition, we show how the likelihood gradient can be computed by a linear-time algorithm.

AB  - In this article, a biallelic reversible mutation model with linear and quadratic selection is analysed. The approach reconnects to one proposed by Kimura (1979), who starts from a diffusion model and derives its equilibrium distribution up to a constant. We use a boundary-mutation Moran model, which approximates a general mutation model for small effective mutation rates, and derive its equilibrium distribution for polymorphic and monomorphic variants in small to moderately sized populations. Using this model, we show that biased mutation rates and linear selection alone can cause patterns of polymorphism within and substitution rates between populations that are usually ascribed to balancing or overdominant selection. We illustrate this using a data set of short introns and fourfold degenerate sites from Drosophila simulans and Drosophila melanogaster. (C) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - A plausible biocontrol strategy for the eradication of invasive species involves augmenting wild populations with genetically modified supermales. Supermales contain double YY chromosomes. When they are augmented into a wild population, destabilization and eventual extinction occurs over time due to a strongly skewed gender ratio towards males. Here, we employ a mathematical model that considers an Allee effect, but we have discovered through simulation that the presence of supermales leads to an increase in the minimal number of females needed for survival at a value higher than the mathematically defined Allee effect. Using this effect, we focus our research on exploring the sensitivity of the optimized supply rate of supermale fish to the initial gender ratio and density of the wild populations.

AB  - For many diseases, the basic reproduction number (R-0) is a threshold parameter for disease extinction or survival in isolated populations. However no human population is fully isolated from other human or animal populations. We use compartmental models to derive simple rules for the basic reproduction number in populations where an endemic disease is sustained by a combination of local transmission within the population and exposure from some other source: either a reservoir exposure or imported cases. We introduce the idea of a reservoir-driven or importation-driven disease: diseases that would become extinct in the population of interest without reservoir exposure or imported cases (since R-0 < 1), but nevertheless may be sufficiently transmissible that many or most infections are acquired from humans in that population. We show that in the simplest case, R-0 < 1 if and only if the proportion of infections acquired from the external source exceeds the disease prevalence and explore how population heterogeneity and the interactions of multiple strains affect this rule. We apply these rules in two case studies of Clostridium difficile infection and colonisation: C. difficile in the hospital setting accounting for imported cases, and C. difficile in the general human population accounting for exposure to animal reservoirs. We demonstrate that even the hospital-adapted, highly-transmissible NAP1/RT027 strain of C. difficile had a reproduction number <1 in a landmark study of hospitalised patients and therefore was sustained by colonised and infected admissions to the study hospital. We argue that C. difficile should be considered reservoir-driven if as little as 13.0% of transmission can be attributed to animal reservoirs. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - For a population to acquire a complex adaptation requiring multiple individually neutral mutations, it must cross a plateau in the fitness landscape. We consider plateaus involving three mutations, and show that large populations can cross them rapidly via lineages that acquire multiple mutations while remaining at low frequency, much faster than the proportional to mu(3) rate for simultaneous triple mutations. Plateau-crossing is fastest for very large populations. At intermediate population sizes, recombination can greatly accelerate adaptation by combining independent mutant lineages to form triple-mutants. For more frequent recombination, such that the population is kept near linkage equilibrium, we extend our analysis to find simple expressions for the expected time to cross plateaus of arbitrary width.

AB  - We consider the ancestral state reconstruction problem where we need to infer phenotypes of ancestors using observations from present-day species. For this problem, we propose a multi-task learning method that uses regularized maximum likelihood to estimate the ancestral states of various traits simultaneously. We then show both theoretically and by simulation that this method improves the estimates of the ancestral states compared to the maximum likelihood method. The result also indicates that for the problem of ancestral state reconstruction under the Brownian motion model, the maximum likelihood method can be improved. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - When predicting the fate and consequences of recurring deleterious mutations in self-fertilising populations most models developed make the assumption that populations have discrete non overlapping generations. This makes them biologically irrelevant when considering perennial species with overlapping generations and where mating occurs independently of the age group. The few models studying the effect of perennial life-histories on the genetic properties of populations in the presence of self-fertilisation have done so considering age-dependent selection. They find low levels of inbreeding depression in perennial populations that do not explain empirical observations. Here we propose a simple deterministic model in continuous time with selection at different fitness traits and feedback between population fitness and size. We find that a perennial life-history can result in high levels of inbreeding depression in spite of inbreeding, due to higher frequencies of heterozygous individuals at the adult stage. We also propose that there may be demographic advantages for self-fertilisation that are independent of reproductive success. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Many versions of the effective population size (N-e) exist, and they are important in population genetics in order to quantify rates of change of various characteristics, such as inbreeding, heterozygosity, or allele frequencies. Traditionally, N-e was defined for single, isolated populations, but we have recently presented a mathematical framework for subdivided populations. In this paper we focus on diploid populations with geographic subdivision, and present new theoretical results. We compare the haploid and diploid versions of the inbreeding effective size (N-ei) with novel expression for the variance effective size (N-ev), and conclude that for local populations N-ev is often much smaller than both versions of Nei, whenever they exist. Global N(ev)of the metapopulation, on the other hand, is close to the haploid Net and much larger than the diploid Nei. We introduce a new effective size, the additive genetic variance effective size Neill', which is of particular interest for long term protection of species. It quantifies the rate at which additive genetic variance is lost and we show that this effective size is closely related to the haploid version of Nei. Finally, we introduce a new measure of a population's deviation from migration-drift equilibrium, and apply it to quantify the time it takes to reach this equilibrium. Our findings are of importance for understanding the concept of effective population size in substructured populations and many of the results have applications in conservation biology.

AB  - Underdominant mutations have fixed between divergent species, yet classical models suggest that rare underdominant alleles are purged quickly except in small or subdivided populations. We predict that underdominant alleles that also influence mate choice, such as those affecting coloration patterns visible to mates and predators alike, can fix more readily. We analyze a mechanistic model of positive assortative mating in which individuals have n chances to sample compatible mates. This one-parameter model naturally spans random mating (n = 1) and complete assortment (n -> infinity), yet it produces sexual selection whose strength depends non-monotonically on n. This sexual selection interacts with viability selection to either inhibit or facilitate fixation. As mating opportunities increase, underdominant alleles fix as frequently as neutral mutations, even though sexual selection and underdominance independently each suppress rare alleles. This mechanism allows underdominant alleles to fix in large populations and illustrates how life history can affect evolutionary change. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Use of the Wolbachia bacterium is a proposed new strategy to reduce dengue transmission, which results in around 390 million individuals infected annually. In places with strong variations in climatic conditions such as temperature and rainfall, dengue epidemics generally occur only at a certain time of the year. Where dengue is not endemic, the time of year in which imported cases enter the population plays a crucial role in determining the likelihood of outbreak occurrence. We use a mathematical model to study the effects of Wolbachia on dengue transmission dynamics and dengue seasonality. We focus in regions where dengue is not endemic but can spread due to the presence of a dengue vector and the arrival of people with dengue on a regular basis. Our results show that the time-window in which outbreaks can occur is reduced in the presence of Wolbachia-carrying Aedes aegypti mosquitoes by up to six weeks each year. We find that Wolbachia reduces overall case numbers by up to 80%. The strongest effect is obtained when the amplitude of the seasonal forcing is low (0.02-0.30). The benefits of Wolbachia also depend on the transmission rate, with the bacteria most effective at moderate transmission rates ranging between 0.08-0.12. Such rates are consistent with fitted estimates for Cairns, Australia. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Use of relationships between individuals to estimate genetic variances and heritabilities via mixed models is standard practice in human, plant and livestock genetics. Different models or information for relationships may give different estimates of genetic variances. However, comparing these estimates across different relationship models is not straightforward as the implied base populations differ between relationship models. In this work, I present a method to compare estimates of variance components across different relationship models. I suggest referring genetic variances obtained using different relationship models to the same reference population, usually a set of individuals in the population. Expected genetic variance of this population is the estimated variance component from the mixed model times a statistic, D-k, which is the average self-relationship minus the average (self- and across-) relationship. For most typical models of relationships, D-k is close to 1. However, this is not true for very deep pedigrees, for identity-by-state relationships, or for non-parametric kernels, which tend to overestimate the genetic variance and the heritability. Using mice data, I show that heritabilities from identity-by-state and kernel-based relationships are overestimated. Weighting these estimates by D-k scales them to a base comparable to genomic or pedigree relationships, avoiding wrong comparisons, for instance, "missing heritabilities". (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Rare long distance dispersal events are thought to have a disproportionate impact on the spread of invasive species. Modelling using integrodifference equations suggests that, when long distance contacts are represented by a fat-tailed dispersal kernel, an accelerating wave of advance can ensue. Invasions spreading in this manner could have particularly dramatic effects. Recently, various authors have suggested that demographic stochasticity disrupts wave acceleration. Integrodifference models have been widely used in movement ecology, and as such a clearer understanding of stochastic effects is needed. Here, we present a stochastic non-linear one-dimensional lattice model in which demographic stochasticity and the dispersal regime can be systematically varied. Extensive simulations show that stochasticity has a profound effect on model behaviour, and usually breaks acceleration for fat-tailed kernels. Exceptions are seen for some power law kernels, K(l) alpha vertical bar l vertical bar(-beta) with beta < 3, for which acceleration persists despite stochasticity. Such kernels lack a second moment and are important in 'accelerating' phenomena such as Levy flights. Furthermore, for long-range kernels the approach to the continuum limit behaviour as stochasticity is reduced is generally slow. Given that real-world populations are finite, stochastic models may give better predictive power when long-range dispersal is important. Insights from mean-field models such as integrodifference equations should be applied with caution in such circumstances. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Positive and negative interactions within and between species may occur simultaneously, with the net effect depending on population densities. For instance, at low densities plants may ameliorate stress, while competition for resources dominates at higher densities. Here, we propose a simple two-species model in which con- and heterospecifics have a positive effect on per capita growth rate at low densities, while negative interactions dominate at high densities. The model thus includes both Allee effects (intraspecific positive effects) and mutualism (interspecific positive effects), as well as intra- and interspecific competition. Using graphical methods we derive conditions for alternative stable states and species coexistence. We show that mutual non-invasibility (i.e. the inability of each species to invade a population of the other) is more likely when species have a strong positive effect on the own species or a strong negative effect on the other species. Mutual non-invasibility implies alternative stable states, however, there may also be alternative stable states at which species coexist. In the case of species symmetry (i.e. when species are indistinguishable), such alternative coexistence states require that if the positive effect exerted at low densities at the own species is stronger than on the other species, the negative effect at higher densities is also stronger on the own species than on the other species, or, vice versa, if the interspecific positive effects at low densities are stronger than the intraspecific effects, the negative effects at higher densities are also stronger between species than within species. However, the reachability of alternative stable states is restricted by the frequency and density at which species are introduced during community assembly, so that alternative stable states do not always represent alternative endstates of community assembly.

AB  - Learning abilities are categorized into social (learning from others) and individual learning (learning on one's own). Despite the typically higher cost of individual learning, there are mechanisms that allow stable coexistence of both learning modes in a single population. In this paper, we investigate by means of mathematical modeling how the effect of spatial structure on evolutionary outcomes of pure social and individual learning strategies depends on the mechanisms for coexistence. We model a spatially structured population based on the infinite-island framework and consider three scenarios that differ in coexistence mechanisms. Using the inclusive-fitness method, we derive the equilibrium frequency of social learners and the genetic load of social learning (defined as average fecundity reduction caused by the presence of social learning) in terms of some summary statistics, such as relatedness, for each of the three scenarios and compare the results. This comparative analysis not only reconciles previous models that made contradictory predictions as to the effect of spatial structure on the equilibrium frequency of social learners but also derives a simple mathematical rule that determines the sign of the genetic load (i.e. whether or not social learning contributes to the mean fecundity of the population).

AB  - The Wright-Fisher process with selection is an important tool in population genetics theory. Traditional analysis of this process relies on the diffusion approximation. The diffusion approximation is usually studied in a partial differential equations framework. In this paper, I introduce a path integral formalism to study the Wright-Fisher process with selection and use that formalism to obtain a simple perturbation series to approximate the transition density. The perturbation series can be understood in terms of Feynman diagrams, which have a simple probabilistic interpretation in terms of selective events. The perturbation series proves to be an accurate approximation of the transition density for weak selection and is shown to be arbitrarily accurate for any selection coefficient.

AB  - In order to understand the development of non-genetically encoded actions during an animal's lifespan, it is necessary to analyze the dynamics and evolution of learning rules producing behavior. Owing to the intrinsic stochastic and frequency-dependent nature of learning dynamics, these rules are often studied in evolutionary biology via agent-based computer simulations. In this paper, we show that stochastic approximation theory can help to qualitatively understand learning dynamics and formulate analytical models for the evolution of learning rules. We consider a population of individuals repeatedly interacting during their lifespan, and where the stage game faced by the individuals fluctuates according to an environmental stochastic process. Individuals adjust their behavioral actions according to learning rules belonging to the class of experience-weighted attraction learning mechanisms, which includes standard reinforcement and Bayesian learning as special cases. We use stochastic approximation theory in order to derive differential equations governing action play probabilities, which turn out to have qualitative features of mutator-selection equations. We then perform agent-based simulations to find the conditions where the deterministic approximation is closest to the original stochastic learning process for standard 2-action 2-player fluctuating games, where interaction between learning rules and preference reversal may occur. Finally, we analyze a simplified model for the evolution of learning in a producer-scrounger game, which shows that the exploration rate can interact in a non-intuitive way with other features of co-evolving learning rules. Overall, our analyses illustrate the usefulness of applying stochastic approximation theory in the study of animal learning. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - We investigate the properties of a Wright-Fisher diffusion process starting at frequency x at time 0 and conditioned to be at frequency y at time T. Such a process is called a bridge. Bridges arise naturally in the analysis of selection acting on standing variation and in the inference of selection from allele frequency time series. We establish a number of results about the distribution of neutral Wright-Fisher bridges and develop a novel rejection-sampling scheme for bridges under selection that we use to study their behavior.

AB  - Age structure is incorporated in many types of epidemic models. Often it is convenient to assume that such models converge to early asymptotic behaviour quickly, before the susceptible population has been appreciably depleted. We make use of dynamical systems theory to show that for some reasonable parameter values, this convergence can be slow. Such a possibility should therefore be considered when parametrising age-structured epidemic models. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this study, we investigate the evolutionarily stable schedule of growth and sex allocation for marine benthic species that contain dwarf males. We consider a population in an ephemeral microhabitat that receives a constant supply of larvae. Small individuals can immediately reproduce as a dwarf male or remain immature and grow. Large individuals allocate reproductive resources between male and female functions. The fraction c of newly settled individuals who remain immature and the sex allocation of large individuals m are quantities to evolve. In the stationary ESS, if the relative reproductive success of dwarf males is greater than the survivorship of immature individuals until they reach a mature size, then the population is a mixture of females and dwarf males. If the opposite inequality holds, the population is dominated by hermaphrodites and lacks dwarf males. There is no case in which a mixture of hermaphrodites and dwarf males to be the ESS in the stationary solution. The ESS can be solved by dynamic programming when the strategies depend on the age of the microhabitat (c (t) and m (t)). Typically, the ESS schedule begins with a population composed only of hermaphrodites, which is replaced by a mixture of dwarf males and hermaphrodites and then by a mixture of dwarf males and pure females. The relative importance of these three phases depends on multiple parameters. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - We consider the Moran model of population genetics with two types, mutation, and selection, and investigate the line of descent of a randomly -sampled individual from a contemporary population. We trace this ancestral line back into the distant past, far beyond the most recent common ancestor of the population (thus connecting population genetics to phylogeny), and analyse the mutation process along this line. To this end, we use the pruned lookdown ancestral selection graph (Lenz et al., 2015), which consists of a set of potential ancestors of the sampled individual at any given time. Relative to the neutral case (that is, without selection), we obtain a general bias towards the beneficial type, an increase in the beneficial mutation rate, and a decrease in the deleterious mutation rate. This sheds new light on previous analytical results. We discuss our findings in the light of a well-known observation at the interface of phylogeny and population genetics, namely, the difference in the mutation rates (or, more precisely, mutation fluxes) estimated via phylogenetic methods relative to those observed in pedigree studies.

AB  - The pioneering work of Kermack and McKendrick (1927, 1932, 1933) is now most known for introducing the SIR model, which divides a population into discrete compartments for susceptible, infected and removed individuals. The SIR model is the archetype of widely used compartmental models for epidemics. It is sometimes forgotten, that Kermack and McKendrick introduced the SIR model as a special case of a more general framework. This general framework distinguishes individuals not only by whether they are susceptible, infected or removed, but additionally tracks the time passed since they got infected. Such time-since-infection models can mechanistically link within-host dynamics to the population level. This allows the models to account for more details of the disease dynamics, such as delays of infectiousness and symptoms during the onset of an infection. Details like this can be vital for interpreting epidemiological data.
   The time-since-infection framework was originally formulated for a host population with a single pathogen. However, the interactions of multiple pathogens within hosts and within a population can be crucial for understanding the severity and spread of diseases. Current models for multiple pathogens mostly rely on compartmental models. While such models are relatively easy to set up, they do not have the same mechanistic underpinning as time-since-infection models. To approach this gap of connecting within-host dynamics of multiple pathogens to the population level, we here extend the time-since-infection framework of Kermack and McKendrick for two pathogens.
   We derive formulas for the basic reproduction numbers in the system. Those numbers determine whether a pathogen can invade a population, potentially depending on whether the other pathogen is present or not. We then demonstrate use of the framework by setting up a simple within-host model that we connect to the population model. The example illustrates the context-specific information required for this type of model, and shows how the system can be simulated numerically. We verify that the formulas for the basic reproduction numbers correctly specify the invasibility conditions. (c) 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Population projections rely on one-sex renewal models. Consequently, changing the projection of male mortality does not affect the projection of birth, contradicting commonsense. A two-sex renewal model is presented in this paper to provide a better description of reproduction and more reasonable population projections. This model is nonlinear and includes the one-sex renewal models as special cases. In this model, age-specific birth rates are defined for two sexes jointly; total fertility, net reproduction rate, and intrinsic growth rate are also derived for two sexes jointly; and age-specific populations approach or converge to stable status. Applying the two-sex renewal model to Australia, it indicates that one-sex models underestimated the intrinsic growth rate by 14 percent. Compared to the results of one-sex models, the two-sex model would provide higher growth rate for low-fertility countries, and lower growth rate for high-fertility countries. In other words, the one-sex models are commonly biased. If the two-sex model is applied to all the countries, it would project smaller populations for the world in the future. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Paternal care is unusual among primates; in most species males compete with one another for the acquisition of mates and leave the raising of offspring to the mothers. Callitrichids defy this trend with both fathers and older siblings contributing to the care of offspring. We extend a two-strategy population model (paternal care versus male-male competition) to account for various mechanisms that could possibly explain why male callitrichids invest in paternal care over male-male competition, and compare results from callitrichid, chimpanzee and hunter-gatherer life history parameters. The survival benefit to offspring due to care is an insufficient explanation of callitrichid paternal care, and the additional inclusion of differences in lactation-related biology similarly do not change that picture. Instead, paternal care may arise in parallel with, or even as a result of, mate guarding, which in turn is only beneficial when partners are scarce as modelled by the birth sex ratio in callitrichids and menopause in hunter-gatherers. In that situation, care need not even provide any benefit to the young (in the form of a survival bonus) for guarding to out-compete multiple mating competition.

AB  - Recently, the selection-recombination equation with a single selected site and an arbitrary number of neutral sites was solved by Alberti and Baake (2021) by means of the ancestral selection-recombination graph. Here, we introduce a more accessible approach, namely the ancestral initiation graph. The construction is based on a discretisation of the selection-recombination equation. We apply our method to systematically explain a long-standing observation concerning the dynamics of linkage disequilibrium between two neutral loci hitchhiking along with a selected one. In particular, this clarifies the nontrivial dependence on the position of the selected site. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Understanding tick-transmitted pathogens in tick infested areas is crucial for the development of preventive and control measures in response to the increasing cases of tick-borne diseases. A stochastic model for the dynamics of two pathogens, Rickettsia parkeri and Rickettsia amblyommii, in a single tick, Amblyomma americanum, is developed and analysed. The model, a continuous-time Markov chain, is based on a deterministic tick-borne disease model. The extinction threshold for the stochastic model is computed using the multitype branching process and conditions for pathogen extinction or persistence are presented. The probability of pathogen extinction is computed using numerical simulations and is shown to be a good estimate of the probability of extinction calculated from the branching process. A sensitivity analysis is undertaken to illustrate the relationship between co-feeding and transovarial transmission rates and the probability of pathogen extinction. Expected epidemic duration is estimated using sample paths and we show that R. amblyommii is likely to persist slightly longer than R. parkeri. Further, we estimate the duration of possible coexistence of the two pathogens. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - In-host mutation of a cross-species infectious disease to a form that is transmissible between humans has resulted with devastating global pandemics in the past. We use simple mathematical models to describe this process with the aim to better understand the emergence of an epidemic resulting from such a mutation and the extent of measures that are needed to control it. The feared outbreak of a human-human transmissible form of avian influenza leading to a global epidemic is the paradigm for this study. We extend the SIR approach to derive a deterministic and a stochastic formulation to describe the evolution of two classes of susceptible and infected states and a removed state, leading to a system of ordinary differential equations and a stochastic equivalent based on a Markov process. For the deterministic model, the contrasting timescale of the mutation process and disease infectiousness is exploited in two limits using asymptotic analysis in order to determine, in terms of the model parameters, necessary conditions for an epidemic to take place and timescales for the onset of the epidemic, the size and duration of the epidemic and the maximum level of the infected individuals at one time. Furthermore, the basic reproduction number R-0 is determined from asymptotic analysis of a distinguished limit. Comparisons between the deterministic and stochastic model demonstrate that stochasticity has little effect on most aspects of an epidemic, but does have significant impact on its onset particularly for smaller populations and lower mutation rates for representatively large populations. The deterministic model is extended to investigate a range of quarantine and vaccination programmes, whereby in the two asymptotic limits analysed, quantitative estimates on the outcomes and effectiveness of these control measures are established.

AB  - The stationary distribution of the diffusion limit of the 2-island, 2-allele Wright-Fisher with small but otherwise arbitrary mutation and migration rates is investigated. Following a method developed by Burden and Tang (2016, 2017) for approximating the forward Kolmogorov equation, the stationary distribution is obtained to leading order as a set of line densities on the edges of the sample space, corresponding to states for which one island is bi-allelic and the other island is non-segregating, and a set of point masses at the corners of the sample space, corresponding to states for which both islands are simultaneously non-segregating. Analytic results for the corner probabilities and line densities are verified independently using the backward generator and for the corner probabilities using the coalescent. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - In population genetics, fixation of traits in a demographically changing population under frequency-independent selection has been extensively analysed. In evolutionary game theory, models of fixation have typically focused on fixed population sizes and frequency-dependent selection. A combination of demographic fluctuations with frequency-dependent interactions such as Lotka-Volterra dynamics has received comparatively little attention. We consider a stochastic, competitive Lotka-Volterra model with higher order interactions between two traits. The emerging individual-based model allows for stochastic fluctuations in the frequencies of the two traits and the total population size. We calculate the fixation probability of a trait under differing competition coefficients. This fixation probability resembles, qualitatively, the deterministic evolutionary dynamics. Furthermore, we partially disentangle the selection effects into their ecological and evolutionary components. We find that changing the evolutionary selection strength also changes the population dynamics and vice versa. Thus, a clean separation of the ecological and evolutionary effects is not possible. Instead, our results imply a nested interaction of the evolutionary and ecological effects. The entangled eco-evolutionary processes thus cannot be ignored when determining fixation properties in a co-evolutionary system. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this study, I explored the impact of constructing a new dispersal route between two different patches in a metapopulation. My results indicated that its success failure on the population abundance greatly depends on the patches directly involved and negligibly on the network topology. Specifically, constructing a dispersal route is highly recommended if it connects a source to a source that is close to becoming a sink or a sink that is close to becoming a source. This biological property is the basis for understanding the influence of the network topology on the population abundance. According to some thresholds discussed in this manuscript, I identified when a given route has a positive or negative effect on the population size. Consequently, as a simple rule of thumb, managers should look for metapopulations that have the maximum (resp. minimum) number paths with a positive (resp. negative) effect on the population abundance. As emphasized, the biological results of this paper do not depend on the model formulation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this work, mate choice is modeled by means of the abstract concept of mutual mating propensity. This only assumes that different types of couples can have different mating success. The model is adequate for any population where mating occurs among distinct types. There is no extra assumption about particular mating scheme or preference model. The concept of mutual mating propensity permits to express the observed change in the mating phenotypes as the gain in information with respect to random mating. The obtained expression is a form of the Price equation in which the mapping between ancestral and descendant population is substituted by a mapping between random mating and non random mating population.
   At the same time, this framework provides the connection between mate choice and the exact mathematical partition of the choice effects, namely sexual isolation, sexual selection and a mixed effect. The sexual selection component is the sum of the intra-sexual male and female selection.
   The proposed framework helps to unveil previously hidden invariants. For example, if the mutual preference between partner types is multiplicative there is no sexual isolation (inter-sexual selection) effect on the frequencies, i.e. the only possible effect of mate choice is intra-sexual selection. On the contrary, whatever the contribution of each partner to the mutual preference, if it comes as a non multiplicative factor, there is at least an inter-sexual selection detectable effect.
   This new view over the mate choice problem, permits to develop general mating propensity models and to make predictions of the mate choice effects that may emerge from such models. This possibility opens up the way for setting a general theory of model fitting and multimodel inference for mate choice.
   Thus, it is suggested that the proposed framework, by describing mate choice as the flow of information due to non-random mating, provides a new important setting for exploring different mating models and their consequences. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Mendel (1866) suggested that if many heritable "factors" contribute to a trait, near-continuous variation could result. Fisher (1918) clarified the connection between Mendelian inheritance and continuous trait variation by assuming many loci, each with small effect, and by informally invoking the central limit theorem. Barton et al. (2017) rigorously analyze the approach to a multivariate Gaussian distribution of the genetic effects for descendants of parents who may be related. This commentary distinguishes three nested approximations, referred to as "infinitesimal genetics," "Gaussian descendants" and "Gaussian population," each plausibly called "the infinitesimal model." The first and most basic is Fisher's "infinitesimal" approximation of the underlying genetics-namely, many loci, each making a small contribution to the total variance. As Barton et al. (2017) show, in the limit as the number of loci increases (with enough additivity), the distribution of genotypic values for descendants approaches a multivariate Gaussian, whose variance-covariance structure depends only on the relatedness, not the phenotypes, of the parents (or whether their population experiences selection or other processes such as mutation and migration). Barton et al. (2017) call this rigorously defensible "Gaussian descendants" approximation "the infinitesimal model." However, it is widely assumed that Fisher's genetic assumptions yield another Gaussian approximation, in which the distribution of breeding values in a population follows a Gaussian even if the population is subject to non-Gaussian selection. This third "Gaussian population" approximation, is also described as the "infinitesimal model." Unlike the "Gaussian descendants" approximation, this third approximation cannot be rigorously justified, except in a weak-selection limit, even for a purely additive model. Nevertheless, it underlies the two most widely used descriptions of selection-induced changes in trait means and genetic variances, the "breeder's equation" and the "Bulmer effect." Future generations may understand why the "infinitesimal model" provides such useful approximations in the face of epistasis, linkage, linkage disequilibrium and strong selection.

AB  - The seasonal distribution of metabolic activity determines how much individuals experience different aspects of a periodically changing environment. Seasonal metabolic-activity patterns of coexisting species may differ significantly despite their shared environmental conditions, suggesting that interspecific diversification of this trait has a major role in the coexistence of competing species. In the present study the effect of the seasonal distribution of metabolic activity on intra- and interspecific competition is investigated in a consumer-resource model. It is shown that, in a periodically changing environment, for each environmental preference pattern there is an ideal seasonal distribution of metabolic activity, which results in maximum resource utilisation efficiency and competitive superiority. Contrary to the common: interpretation of temporal niche segregation, opposing species-specific seasonal preferences are not a sufficient condition for the coexistence of two species on a population dynamical time scale. A necessary and sufficient condition for coexistence is the temporal segregation of the species via different seasonal activity distributions. However, coexistence is evolutionarily stable only if seasonal metabolic activities and preferences are positively correlated. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - We give recursions for the expected site-frequency spectrum associated with so-called Xi-coalescents, that is exchangeable coalescents which admit simultaneous multiple mergers of ancestral lineages. Xi-coalescents arise, for example, in association with population models of skewed offspring distributions with diploidy, recurrent advantageous mutations, or strong bottlenecks. In contrast, the simpler Lambda-coalescents admit multiple mergers of lineages, but at most one such merger each time. Xi-coalescents, as well as Lambda-coalescents, can predict an excess of singletons, compared to the Kingman coalescent. We compare estimates of coalescent parameters when Xi-coalescents are applied to data generated by Lambda-coalescents, and vice versa. In general, Xi-coalescents predict fewer singletons than corresponding Lambda-coalescents, but a higher count of mutations of size larger than singletons. We fit examples of Xi-coalescents to unfolded site-frequency spectra obtained for autosomal loci of the diploid Atlantic cod, and obtain different coalescent parameter estimates than obtained with corresponding Lambda-coalescents. Our results provide new inference tools, and suggest that for autosomal population genetic data from diploid or polyploid highly fecund populations who may have skewed offspring distributions, one should not apply Lambda-coalescents, but Xi-coalescents.

AB  - In the last few years, several statistically consistent consensus methods for species tree inference have been devised that are robust to the gene tree discordance caused by incomplete lineage sorting in unstructured ancestral populations. One source of gene tree discordance that has only recently been identified as a potential obstacle for phylogenetic inference is ancestral population structure. In this article, we describe a general model of ancestral population structure, and by relying on a single carefully constructed example scenario, we show that the consensus methods Democratic Vote, STEAC, STAR, R* Consensus, Rooted Triple Consensus, Minimize Deep Coalescences, and Majority-Rule Consensus are statistically inconsistent under the model. We find that among the consensus methods evaluated, the only method that is statistically consistent in the presence of ancestral population structure is GLASS/Maximum Tree. We use simulations to evaluate the behavior of the various consensus methods in a model with ancestral population structure, showing that as the number of gene trees increases, estimates on the basis of GLASS/Maximum Tree approach the true species tree topology irrespective of the level of population structure, whereas estimates based on the remaining methods only approach the true species tree topology if the level of structure is low. However, through simulations using species trees both with and without ancestral population structure, we show that GLASS/Maximum Tree performs unusually poorly on gene trees inferred from alignments with little information. This practical limitation of GLASS/Maximum Tree together with the inconsistency of other methods prompts the need for both further testing of additional existing methods and development of novel methods under conditions that incorporate ancestral population structure.

AB  - Individual inbreeding coefficient (F) and pairwise relatedness (r) are fundamental parameters in population genetics and have important applications in diverse fields such as human medicine, forensics, plant and animal breeding, conservation and evolutionary biology. Traditionally, both parameters are calculated from pedigrees, but are now increasingly estimated from genetic marker data. Conceptually, a pedigree gives the expected F and r values, F-p and r(p), with the expectations being taken (hypothetically) over an infinite number of individuals with the same pedigree. In contrast, markers give the realised (actual) F and r values at the particular marker loci of the particular individuals, F-M and r(M). Both pedigree (F-p, r(p)) and marker (F-M, r(M)) estimates can be used as inferences of genomic inbreeding coefficients F-G and genomic relatedness r(G), which are the underlying quantities relevant to most applications (such as estimating inbreeding depression and heritability) of F and r. In the pre-genomic era, it was widely accepted that pedigrees are much better than markers in delineating F-G and r(G), and markers should better be used to validate, amend and construct pedigrees rather than to replace them. Is this still true in the genomic era when genome-wide dense SNPs are available? In this simulation study, I showed that genomic markers can yield much better estimates of F-G and r(G) than pedigrees when they are numerous (say, 10(4) SNPs) under realistic situations (e.g. genome and population sizes). Pedigree estimates are especially poor for species with a small genome, where F-G and r(G) are determined to a large extent by Mendelian segregations and may thus deviate substantially from their expectations (F-p and r(p)). Simulations also confirmed that F-M, when estimated from many SNPs, can be much more powerful than F-p for detecting inbreeding depression in viability. However, I argue that pedigrees cannot be replaced completely by genomic SNPs, because the former allows for the calculation of more complicated IBD coefficients (involving more than 2 individuals, more than one locus, and more than 2 genes at a locus) for which the latter may have reduced capacity or limited power, and because the former has social and other significance for remote relationships which have little genetic significance and cannot be inferred reliably from markers.

AB  - Recent positive selection can increase the frequency of an advantageous mutant rapidly enough that a relatively long ancestral haplotype will be remained intact around it. We present a hidden Markov model (HMM) to identify such haplotype structures. With HMM identified haplotype structures, a population genetic model for the extent of ancestral haplotypes is then adopted for parameter inference of the selection intensity and the allele age. Simulations show that this method can detect selection under a wide range of conditions and has higher power than the existing frequency spectrum-based method. In addition, it provides good estimate of the selection coefficients and allele ages for strong selection. The method analyzes large data sets in a reasonable amount of running time. This method is applied to HapMap III data for a genome scan, and identifies a list of candidate regions putatively under recent positive selection. It is also applied to several genes known to be under recent positive selection, including the LCT, KITLG and TYRP1 genes in Northern Europeans, and OCA2 in East Asians, to estimate their allele ages and selection coefficients.

AB  - Both evolution and ecology have long been concerned with the impact of variable environmental conditions on observed levels of genetic diversity within and between species. We model the evolution of a quantitative trait under selection that fluctuates in space and time, and derive an analytical condition for when these fluctuations promote genetic diversification. As ecological scenario we use a generalized island model with soft selection within patches in which we incorporate generation overlap. We allow for arbitrary fluctuations in the environment including spatio-temporal correlations and any functional form of selection on the trait. Using the concepts of invasion fitness and evolutionary branching, we derive a simple and transparent condition for the adaptive evolution and maintenance of genetic diversity. This condition relates the strength of selection within patches to expectations and variances in the environmental conditions across space and time. Our results unify, clarify, and extend a number of previous results on the evolution and maintenance of genetic variation under fluctuating selection. Individual-based simulations show that our results are independent of the details of the genetic architecture and whether reproduction is clonal or sexual. The onset of increased genetic variance is predicted accurately also in small populations in which alleles can go extinct due to environmental stochasticity. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - When vital rates depend on population structure (e.g., relative frequencies of males or females), an important question is how the long-term population growth rate lambda responds to changes in rates. For instance, availability of mates may depend on the sex ratio of the population and hence reproductive rates could be frequency-dependent. In such cases change in any vital rate alters the structure, which in turn, affect frequency-dependent rates. We show that the elasticity of lambda to a rate is the sum of (i) the effect of the linear change in the rate and (ii) the effect of nonlinear changes in frequency-dependent rates. The first component is always positive and is the classical elasticity in density-independent models obtained directly from the population projection matrix. The second component can be positive or negative and is absent in density-independent models. We explicitly express each component of the elasticity as a function of vital rates, eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the population projection matrix. We apply this result to a two-sex model, where male and female fertilities depend on adult sex ratio alpha (ratio of females to males) and the mating system (e.g., polygyny) through a harmonic mating function. We show that the nonlinear component of elasticity to a survival rate is negligible only when the average number of mates (per male) is close to alpha. In a strictly monogamous species, elasticity to female survival is larger than elasticity to male survival when alpha < 1 (less females). In a polygynous species, elasticity to female survival can be larger than that of male survival even when sex ratio is female biased. Our results show how demography and mating system together determine the response to selection on sex-specific vital rates. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Mobile genetic elements such as plasmids are increasingly becoming thought of as evolutionarily important. Being horizontally transmissible is generally assumed to be beneficial for a gene. Using several simple modelling approaches we show that in fact being horizontally transferable is just as important for fixation as being beneficial to the host, in line with other results. We find fixation probability is approximately 2(s + beta), where s is the increased (vertical) fitness provided by the gene, and beta the rate of horizontal transfer when rare. This result comes about because when the gene is rare, almost all individuals in the population are possible recipients of horizontal transfer. The ability to horizontally transfer could thus cause a deleterious gene to become fixed in a population even without hitchhiking. Our findings provide further evidence for the importance and ubiquity of mobile genetic elements, particularly in microorganisms. (c) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper introduces a simple greedy algorithm for searching for high likelihood pedigrees using microsatellite (STR) genotype information on a complete sample of related individuals. The core idea behind the algorithm is not new, but it is believed that putting it into a greedy search setting, and specifically the application to pedigree learning, is novel. The algorithm does not require age or sex information, but this information can be incorporated if desired. The algorithm is applied to human and non-human genetic data and in a simulation study.

AB  - We analyse metapopulation dynamics in terms of an individual-based, stochastic model of a finite metapopulation. We suggest a new approach, using the number of patches in the population as a large parameter. This approach does not require that the number of individuals per patch is large, neither is it necessary to assume a time-scale separation between local population dynamics and migration. Our approach makes it possible to accurately describe the dynamics of metapopulations consisting of many small patches. We focus on metapopulations on the brink of extinction. We estimate the time to extinction and describe the most likely path to extinction. We find that the logarithm of the time to extinction is proportional to the product of two vectors, a vector characterising the distribution of patch population sizes in the quasi-steady state, and a vector related to Fisher's reproduction vector that quantifies the sensitivity of the quasi-steady state distribution to demographic fluctuations. We compare our analytical results to stochastic simulations of the model, and discuss the range of validity of the analytical expressions. By identifying fast and slow degrees of freedom in the metapopulation dynamics, we show that the dynamics of large metapopulations close to extinction is approximately described by a deterministic equation originally proposed by Levins (1969). We were able to compute the rates in Levins' equation in terms of the parameters of our stochastic, individual-based model. It turns out, however, that the interpretation of the dynamical variable depends strongly on the intrinsic growth rate and carrying capacity of the patches. Only when the local growth rate and the carrying capacity are large does the slow variable correspond to the number of patches, as envisaged by Levins. Last but not least, we discuss how our findings relate to other, widely used metapopulation models. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - We generalize the lifesaving model to the case when the probability of lifesaving depends on the number of lifesavings in the past. We also suggest a new approach to analyzing the shape of mortality rates based on considering delays in deaths (and possible cure afterwards) which results in the decline of mortality rates. The derived lifetime distribution and the corresponding mortality rate can be used for a more flexible statistical analysis of mortality data. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Specialist species thriving under specific environmental conditions in narrow geographic ranges are widely recognized as heavily threatened by climate deregulation. Many might rely on both their potential to adapt and to disperse towards a refugium to avoid extinction. It is thus crucial to understand the influence of environmental conditions on the unfolding process of adaptation. Here, I study the eco-evolutionary dynamics of a sexually reproducing specialist species in a two-patch quantitative genetic model with moving optima. Thanks to a separation of ecological and evolutionary time scales and the phase-line study of the selection gradient, I derive the critical environmental speed for persistence, which reflects how the existence of a refugium impacts extinction patterns and how it relates to the cost of dispersal. Moreover, the analysis provides key insights about the dynamics that arise on the path towards this refugium. I show that after an initial increase of population size, there exists a critical environmental speed above which the species crosses a tipping point, resulting into an abrupt habitat switch. In addition, when selection for local adaptation is strong, this habitat switch passes through an evolutionary "death valley", leading to a phenomenon related to evolutionary rescue, which can promote extinction for lower environmental speeds than the critical one.

AB  - Multi-type birth-death processes underlie approaches for inferring evolutionary dynamics from phylogenetic trees across biological scales, ranging from deep-time species macroevolution to rapid viral evolution and somatic cellular proliferation. A limitation of current phylogenetic birth-death models is that they require restrictive linearity assumptions that yield tractable message-passing likelihoods, but that also preclude interactions between individuals. Many fundamental evolutionary processes - such as environmental carrying capacity or frequency-dependent selection - entail interactions, and may strongly influence the dynamics in some systems. Here, we introduce a multi-type birth-death process in mean-field interaction with an ensemble of replicas of the focal process. We prove that, under quite general conditions, the ensemble's stochastically evolving interaction field converges to a deterministic trajectory in the limit of an infinite ensemble. In this limit, the replicas effectively decouple, and self-consistent interactions appear as nonlinearities in the infinitesimal generator of the focal process. We investigate a special case that is rich enough to model both carrying capacity and frequency-dependent selection while yielding tractable message-passing likelihoods in the context of a phylogenetic birth-death model.

AB  - The Structured Coalescent was introduced to describe the coalescent process in spatially subdivided populations with migration. Here, we re-interpret migration routes of individuals in the original model as "migration routes"of single genes in tandemly arranged gene arrays. A gene copy may change its position within the array via unequal recombination. Hence, in a coalescent framework, two copies sampled from two chromosomes may coalesce only if they are at exactly homologous positions. Otherwise, one or multiple recombination events have to occur before they can coalesce, thereby increasing mean coalescence time and expected genetic diversity among the copies in a gene array. We explicitly calculate the transition probabilities on these routes backward in time. We simulate the structured coalescent with migration and coalescence rates informed by the unequal recombination process of gene copies. With this novel interpretation of population structure models we determine coalescence times and expected genetic diversity in samples of orthologous and paralogous copies from a gene family. As a case study, we discuss the site frequency spectrum of a small gene family in the two scenarios of high and of no gene copy number variation among individuals. These examples underline the significance of our model, since standard test-statistics may lead to misinterpretations when analyzing sequence data of multi-copy genes due to their different expected genetic diversity.

AB  - Our understanding of aposematism (the conspicuous signalling of a defence for the deterrence of predators) has advanced notably since its first observation in the late nineteenth century. Indeed, it extends the scope of a well-established game-theoretical model of this very same process both from the analytical standpoint (by considering regimes of varying background mortality and colony size) and from the practical standpoint (by assessing its efficacy and limitations in predicting the evolution of prey traits in finite simulated populations). The nature of the manuscript at hand is more mathematical and its aim is two-fold: first, to determine the relationship between evolutionarily stable levels of defence and signal strength under various regimes of background mortality and colony size. Second, to compare these predictions with simulations of finite prey populations that are subject to random local mutation. We compare the roles of absolute resident fitness, mutant fitness and stochasticity in the evolution of prey traits and discuss the importance of population size in the above.Crown Copyright & COPY; 2023 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Health perceptions and health-related behaviors can change at the population level as cultures evolve. In the last decade, despite the proven efficacy of vaccines, the developed world has seen a resurgence of vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs) such as measles, pertussis, and polio. Vaccine hesitancy, which is influenced by historical, political, and socio-cultural forces, is believed to be a primary factor responsible for decreasing vaccine coverage, thereby increasing the risk and occurrence of VPD outbreaks. Behavior change models have been increasingly employed to understand disease dynamics and intervention effectiveness. However, since health behaviors are culturally influenced, it is valuable to examine them within a cultural evolution context. Here, using a mathematical modeling framework, we explore the effects of cultural evolution on vaccine hesitancy and vaccination behavior. With this model, we shed light on facets of cultural evolution (vertical transmission, community influences, homophily, etc.) that promote the spread of vaccine hesitancy, ultimately affecting levels of vaccination coverage and VPD outbreak risk in a population. In addition, we present our model as a generalizable framework for exploring cultural evolution when humans' beliefs influence, but do not strictly dictate, their behaviors. This model offers a means of exploring how parents' potentially conflicting beliefs and cultural traits could affect their children's health and fitness. We show that vaccine confidence and vaccine-conferred benefits can both be driving forces of vaccine coverage. We also demonstrate that an assortative preference among vaccine-hesitant individuals can lead to increased vaccine hesitancy and lower vaccine coverage.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Transposable elements (TEs) are self-reproducing selfish DNA sequences that can invade the genome of virtually all living species. Population genetics models have shown that TE copy numbers generally reach a limit, either because the transposition rate decreases with the number of copies (transposition regulation) or because TE copies are deleterious, and thus purged by natural selection. Yet, recent empirical discoveries suggest that TE regulation may mostly rely on piRNAs, which require a specific mutational event (the insertion of a TE copy in a piRNA cluster) to be activated - the so-called TE regulation "trap model". We derived new population genetics models accounting for this trap mechanism, and showed that the resulting equilibria differ substantially from previous expectations based on a transposition-selection equilibrium. We proposed three sub-models, depending on whether or not genomic TE copies and piRNA cluster TE copies are selectively neutral or deleterious, and we provide analytical expressions for maximum and equilibrium copy numbers, as well as cluster frequencies for all of them. In the full neutral model, the equilibrium is achieved when transposition is completely silenced, and this equilibrium does not depend on the transposition rate. When genomic TE copies are deleterious but not cluster TE copies, no long-term equilibrium is possible, and active TEs are eventually eliminated after an active incomplete invasion stage. When all TE copies are deleterious, a transposition-selection equilibrium exists, but the invasion dynamics is not monotonic, and the copy number peaks before decreasing. Mathematical predictions were in good agreement with numerical simulations, except when genetic drift and/or linkage disequilibrium dominates. Overall, the trap -model dynamics appeared to be substantially more stochastic and less repeatable than traditional regulation models. (c) 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this paper, we deduce the first-order effect of frequency-dependent viability and fertility selection on the probability of fixation of a mutant in a large finite haploid population with a fixed age structure by applying a direct small perturbation method to the neutral two-timescale genealogical process. This effect is expressed in terms of fixation-fitness coefficients times ancestry coefficients that are related to the effective population size. In the case of constant selection, the fixation-fitness coefficients are functions of the coefficients of viability and fertility selection weighted by reproductive values and population-structure coefficients for the different age classes. This explains the difference between the effects of viability selection and fertility selection on fixation probability in age-structured populations. With frequency-dependent selection in the form of a public goods game, the fixation-fitness coefficients depend also on the public good allocation strategy of the population and the resource allocation strategies of the individuals. In this case, the results show that weak selection may favor the fixation of cooperation if the cooperators allocate more resources to reproduction versus survival than the defectors do.

AB  - This paper analyzes source-sink systems with asymmetric dispersal between two patches. Complete analysis on the models demonstrates a mechanism by which the dispersal asymmetry can lead to either an increased total size of the species population in two patches, a decreased total size with persistence in the patches, or even extinction in both patches. For a large growth rate of the species in the source and a fixed dispersal intensity, (i) if the asymmetry is small, the population would persist in both patches and reach a density higher than that without dispersal, in which the population approaches its maximal density at an appropriate asymmetry; (ii) if the asymmetry is intermediate, the population persists in both patches but reaches a density less than that without dispersal; (iii) if the asymmetry is large, the population goes to extinction in both patches; (iv) asymmetric dispersal is more favorable than symmetric dispersal under certain conditions. For a fixed asymmetry, similar phenomena occur when the dispersal intensity varies, while a thorough analysis is given for the low growth rate of the species in the source. Implications for populations in heterogeneous landscapes are discussed, and numerical simulations confirm and extend our results. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Trivers-Willard hypothesis (TWH) states that parents in good condition preferentially produce the sex with a higher variation in reproductive success, whereas parents in bad condition favour the opposite sex. Theorists distinguish two variants of the TWH: (a) a biased sex-ratio at birth and (b) biased parental investment after birth. It has been argued before that the conditions stated by Trivers and Willard (good condition is inherited and affects reproductive success more strongly for one of the sexes) are sufficient for the sex-ratio version but insufficient for the investment version of the MM. However, it has not yet been investigated how these conditions affect parental investment in high and low quality parents, depending on the life-cycle of a species.
   The present study aims to fill this gap by introducing a multi-stage matrix population model with nonlinear mating to describe the effects of parental investment after birth on the reproductive values of male and female individuals. Using methods from adaptive dynamics and evolutionary invasion analysis, evolutionary trajectories and evolutionarily stable strategies are derived for different parameterizations of the model.
   Simulation results demonstrate that the conditions given by Trivers and Willard produce a general bias of parental investment towards the sex with higher variance in reproductive value. This bias is stronger for low-quality parents than for high-quality parents and matches the expected marginal offspring reproductive values for parental investment. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Managing infectious diseases is a world public health issue, plagued by uncertainties. In this paper, we analyze the problem of viable control of a dengue outbreak under uncertainty. For this purpose, we develop a controlled Ross-Macdonald model with mosquito vector control by fumigation, and with uncertainties affecting the dynamics; both controls and uncertainties are supposed to change only once a day, then remain stationary during the day. The robust viability kernel is the set of all initial states such that there exists at least a strategy of insecticide spraying which guarantees that the number of infected individuals remains below a threshold, for all times, and whatever the sequences of uncertainties. Having chosen three nested subsets of uncertainties - a deterministic one (without uncertainty), a medium one and a large one - we can measure the incidence of the uncertainties on the size of the kernel, in particular on its reduction with respect to the deterministic case. The numerical results show that the viability kernel without uncertainties is highly sensitive to the variability of parameters - here the biting rate, the probability of infection to mosquitoes and humans, and the proportion of female mosquitoes per person. So, a robust viability analysis is a possible tool to reveal the importance of uncertainties regarding epidemics control. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Evolutionary models for a cultural trait under vertical and oblique cultural transmission are analyzed. For a dichotomous trait, both the fitnesses of the variants and their rates of transmission are allowed to vary. In one class of models, transmission fluctuates cyclically together with fitnesses, and conditions are derived for a cultural polymorphism. A second class of models has transmission and selection fluctuating randomly with possible covariance between them. A third class of models involves two populations with migration between them and with transmission rates and fitnesses different in the two populations. Numerical analysis leads to qualitative conditions on the transmission rates and fitnesses that allow protected polymorphisms. With symmetric migration analytical conditions for protected polymorphism are derived. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Spatial variability in host density is a key factor affecting disease dynamics of wildlife, and yet there are few spatially explicit models of host-macroparasite dynamics. This limits our understanding of parasitism in migratory hosts, whose densities change considerably in both space and time. In this paper, we develop a model for host-macroparasite dynamics that considers the directional movement of host populations and their associated parasites. We include spatiotemporal changes in the mean and variance in parasite burden per host, as well as parasite-mediated host mortality and parasite-mediated migratory ability. Reduced migratory ability with increasing parasitism results in heavily infested hosts halting their migration, and higher parasite burdens in stationary hosts than in moving hosts. Simulations reveal the potential for positive feedbacks between parasite-reduced migratory ability and increasing parasite burdens at infection hotspots, such as stopover sites, that may lead to parasite-induced migratory stalling. This framework could help understand how global change might influence wildlife disease via changes to migratory patterns and parasite demographic rates. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - There is an ongoing debate about the applicability of chaotic and nonlinear models to ecological systems. Initial introduction of chaotic population models to the ecological literature was largely theoretical in nature and difficult to apply to real-world systems. Here, we build upon and expand prior work by performing an in-depth examination of the dynamical complexities of a spatially explicit chaotic population, within an ecologically applicable modeling framework. We pair a classic chaotic growth model (the logistic map)-with explicit dispersal length scale and shape via a Gaussian dispersal kernel. Spatio-temporal heterogeneity is incorporated by applying stochastic perturbations throughout the spatial domain. We witness a variety of population dynamics dependent on the growth rate, dispersal distance, and domain size. Dispersal serves to eliminate chaotic population behavior for many of the parameter combinations tested. The model displays extreme sensitivity to changes in growth rate, dispersal distance, or domain size, but is robust to low-level stochastic population perturbations. Large and temporally consistent perturbations can lead to a change in population dynamics. Frequent switching occurs between chaotic/non-chaotic behaviors as dispersal distance, domain size, or growth rate increases. Small changes in these parameters are easy to imagine in real populations, and understanding or anticipating the abrupt resulting shifts in population dynamics is important for population management and conservation.

AB  - Background: Hepatitis delta virus (HDV) in conjunction with hepatitis B virus (HBV) increases adult morbidity and mortality. A number of studies have performed cost-benefit analyses for HBV interventions, but they have ignored the impact of HDV on these outcomes.
   Methods: Using a mathematical model of HBV-HDV epidemiology, we compare health benefits and cost outcomes of four interventions: testing with HBV adult vaccination (diagnosis), diagnosis with antiviral treatment for HBV infections (mono-infections), diagnosis with antiviral treatment for HBV-HDV infections (dual-infections), and awareness programs. The relationship between optimal levels and outcomes of each of these interventions and HDV prevalence in HBV infected individuals ranging from 0 to 50% is determined.
   Results: Over a 50 year period under no intervention, HBV prevalence, per capita total cost and death toll increase by 2.25%, -$11 and 2.6-fold respectively in moderate HDV endemic regions compared to mono-infected regions; the corresponding values for high HDV endemic regions are 4.2%, -$21 and 3.9-fold. Optimal interventions can be strategized similarly in mono and dually endemic regions. Only implementation of all four interventions achieves a very low HBV prevalence of around 1.5% in a moderate HDV endemic region such as China, with 2.8 million fewer deaths compared to no intervention. Although the policy of implementation of all four interventions costs additional $382 billion compared to no intervention, it still remains cost-effective with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $1400/QALY. Very high efficacy awareness programs achieve less prevalence with fewer deaths at a lower cost compared to treatment and/or vaccination programs.
   Conclusion: HDV substantially affects the performance of any HBV-related intervention. Its exclusion results in over-estimation of the effectiveness of HBV interventions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Here we analyze how dispersal, genetic drift, and adaptation to the local environment affect the geographical differentiation of a quantitative character through natural selection using a spatial dynamic model for the evolution of the distribution of mean breeding values in space and time. The variation in optimal phenotype is described by local Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes with a given spatial autocorrelation. Selection and drift are assumed to be governed by phenotypic variation within areas with a given mean breeding value and constant additive genetic variance. Between such neighboring areas there will be white noise variation in mean breeding values, while the variation at larger distances has a spatial structure and a spatial scale that we investigate. The model is analyzed by solving balance equations for the stationary distribution of mean breeding values. We also present scaling results for the spatial autocovariance function for mean breeding values as well as that for the covariance between mean breeding value and the optimal phenotype expressing local adaption. Our results show in particular how these spatial scales depend on population density. For large densities the spatial scale of fluctuations in mean breeding values have similarities with corresponding results in population dynamics, where the effect of migration on spatial scales may be large if the local strength of density regulation is small. In our evolutionary model strength of density regulation corresponds to strength of local selection so that weak local selection may produce large spatial scales of autocovariances. Genetic drift and stochastic migration are shown to act through the population size within a characteristic area with much smaller variation in optimal phenotypes than in the whole population.

AB  - We consider the diffusion approximation of the multivariate Wright-Fisher process with mutation. Analytically tractable formulas for the first-and second-order moments of the allele frequency distribution are derived, and the moments are subsequently used to better understand key population genetics parameters and modeling frameworks. In particular we investigate the behavior of the expected homozygosity (the probability that two randomly sampled genes are identical) in the transient and stationary phases, and how appropriate the Dirichlet distribution is for modeling the allele frequency distribution at different evolutionary time scales. We find that the Dirichlet distribution is adequate for the pure drift model (no mutations allowed), but the distribution is not sufficiently flexible for more general mutation models. We suggest a new hierarchical Beta distribution for the allele frequencies in the Wright-Fisher process with a mutation model on the nucleotide level that distinguishes between transitions and transversions.

AB  - The rapid development of sequencing technologies represents new opportunities for population genetics research. It is expected that genomic data will increase our ability to reconstruct the history of populations. While this increase in genetic information will likely help biologists and anthropologists to reconstruct the demographic history of populations, it also represents new challenges. Recent work has shown that structured populations generate signals of population size change. As a consequence it is often difficult to determine whether demographic events such as expansions or contractions (bottlenecks) inferred from genetic data are real or due to the fact that populations are structured in nature. Given that few inferential methods allow us to account for that structure, and that genomic data will necessarily increase the precision of parameter estimates, it is important to develop new approaches. In the present study we analyze two demographic models. The first is a model of instantaneous population size change whereas the second is the classical symmetric island model. We (i) re-derive the distribution of coalescence times under the two models for a sample of size two, (ii) use a maximum likelihood approach to estimate the parameters of these models (iii) validate this estimation procedure under a wide array of parameter combinations, (iv) implement and validate a model rejection procedure by using a Kolmogorov Smirnov test, and a model choice procedure based on the AIC, and (v) derive the explicit distribution for the number of differences between two non-recombining sequences. Altogether we show that it is possible to estimate parameters under several models and perform efficient model choice using genetic data from a single diploid individual. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - In this study, we use entropy related mixing rate modules to measure the effects of temperature on insect population stability and demographic breakdown. The uncertainty in the age of the mother of a randomly chosen newborn, and how it is moved after a finite act of time steps, is modeled using a stochastic transformation of the Leslie matrix. Age classes are represented as a cycle graph and its transitions towards the stable age distribution are brought forth as an exact Markov chain. The dynamics of divergence, from a non equilibrium state towards equilibrium, are evaluated using the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy. Moreover, Kullback-Leibler distance is applied as information-theoretic measure to estimate exact mixing times of age transitions probabilities towards equilibrium.
   Using empirically data, we show that on the initial conditions and simulated projection's trough time, that population entropy can effectively be applied to detect demographic variability towards equilibrium under different temperature conditions. Changes in entropy are correlated with the fluctuations of the insect population decay rates (i.e. demographic stability towards equilibrium). Moreover, shorter mixing times are directly linked to lower entropy rates and vice versa. This may be linked to the properties of the insect model system, which in contrast to warm blooded animals has the ability to greatly change its metabolic and demographic rates. Moreover, population entropy and the related distance measures that are applied, provide a means to measure these rates. The current results and model projections provide clear biological evidence why dynamic population entropy may be useful to measure population stability. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Dispersal plays a fundamental role in shaping the ecological processes such as host parasite interactions, and the understanding of host dispersal tendency leads to that of parasites. Here, we present the result of our study on how the evolutionarily stable dispersal of a host would depend on parasite infection, considering kin competition among neighbours. We show that the evolving dispersal rate might be higher for susceptible than for infected individuals (S-biased dispersal) or vice versa (I-biased dispersal). S-biased dispersal is favoured by strong virulence affecting competitive ability, by high rate of parasite release during dispersal, and by low virulence for infected emigrants (i.e. low virulence affecting dispersal ability), whereas I-biased dispersal is favoured in the opposite situation. We also discuss population structure or between-deme genetic differentiation of the host measured with Wright's F. In I-biased dispersal, between-deme genetic differentiation decreases with the infection rate, while in S-biased dispersal, genetic differentiation increases with infection rate.

AB  - Empirical studies have identified population-genetic factors as important determinants of the properties of genotype-imputation accuracy in imputation-based disease association studies. Here, we develop a simple coalescent model of three sequences that we use to explore the theoretical basis for the influence of these factors on genotype-imputation accuracy, under the assumption of infinitely-many-sites mutation. Employing a demographic model in which two populations diverged at a given time in the past, we derive the approximate expectation and variance of imputation accuracy in a study sequence sampled from one of the two populations, choosing between two reference sequences, one sampled from the same population as the study sequence and the other sampled from the other population. We show that, under this model, imputation accuracy as measured by the proportion of polymorphic sites that are imputed correctly in the study sequence increases in expectation with the mutation rate, the proportion of the markers in a chromosomal region that are genotyped, and the time to divergence between the study and reference populations. Each of these effects derives largely from an increase in information available for determining the reference sequence that is genetically most similar to the sequence targeted for imputation. We analyze as a function of divergence time the expected gain in imputation accuracy in the target using a reference sequence from the same population as the target rather than from the other population. Together with a growing body of empirical investigations of genotype imputation in diverse human populations, our modeling framework lays a foundation for extending imputation techniques to novel populations that have not yet been extensively examined.

AB  - The negative relationship between body mass and population abundance was documented decades ago and forms one of the most fundamental scaling-laws in ecology. However, current theory fails to capture observed variations and the subject continues to raise controversy. Here we unify empirically observed size-abundance relationships with theory, by incorporating allometries in resource encounter rate and metabolic costs of movements. Fractal geometry is used to quantify the underlying resources distributions. Our model predicts that in environments packed with resources, body mass to population abundance relationships is less negative than the commonly assumed -3/4 power law. When resources are more patchily distributed, we predict a more negative exponent. These predictions are consistent with empirical observations. The current research provides an important step towards synthesizing metabolism, resource distribution and the global scaling of animal abundance, explaining why size-abundance relationships vary among feeding guilds and ecosystems.

AB  - Characterizing time-evolution of allele frequencies in a population is a fundamental problem in population genetics. In the Wright-Fisher diffusion, such dynamics is captured by the transition density function, which satisfies well-known partial differential equations. For a multi-allelic model with general diploid selection, various theoretical results exist on representations of the transition density, but finding an explicit formula has remained a difficult problem. In this paper, a technique recently developed for a diallelic model is extended to find an explicit transition density for an arbitrary number of alleles, under a general diploid selection model with recurrent parent-independent mutation. Specifically, the method finds the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the generator associated with the multi-allelic diffusion, thus yielding an accurate spectral representation of the transition density. Furthermore, this approach allows for efficient, accurate computation of various other quantities of interest, including the normalizing constant of the stationary distribution and the rate of convergence to this distribution.

AB  - Altruism and spite are costly to the actor, making their evolution unlikely without specific mechanisms. Nonetheless, both altruistic and spiteful behaviors are present in individuals, which suggests the existence of an underlying mechanism that drives their evolution. If altruistic individuals are more likely to be recipients of altruism than non-altruistic individuals, then altruism can be favored by natural selection. Similarly, if spiteful individuals are less likely to be recipients of spite than non-spiteful individuals, then spite can be favored by natural selection. Spite is altruism's evil twin, ugly sister of altruism, or a shady relative of altruism. In some mechanisms, such as repeated interactions, if altruism is favored by natural selection, then spite is also favored by natural selection. However, there has been limited investigation into whether both behaviors evolve to the same extent. In this study, we focus on the mechanism by which individuals choose to keep or stop the interaction according to the opponent's behavior. Using the evolutionary game theory, we investigate the evolution of altruism and spite under this mechanism. Our model revealed that the evolution of spite is less likely than the evolution of altruism.

AB  - It is worth investigating the existence of cooperation, which is costly for the actor but beneficial to the recipient (precisely because it is costly for the former). If players, when they approach defectors, stop their relationship with them, cooperation can pay off and favorably emerge in the course of evolutionary dynamics. The present study examines the situation in which animals, even when they want to cooperate, sometimes lack the necessary resources, and are thereby prevented from cooperating with others. In addition, it is also considered that the underlying information about the presence or absence of these resources can be conveyed to the opponent player. Here, the opponent who defects-has no resources for cooperation-may be a cooperator or a defector. Therefore, it is not clear which behavior is more likely to evolve, if it is keeping the interaction with such an opponent (i.e., being trustful) or stopping the interaction with such an opponent (i.e., being not trustful). By using evolutionary game theory, it is revealed that those who want to keep the interaction with those without the resources to cooperate are favored by natural selection. This study sheds new light on the role of keeping and stopping interaction in the evolution of cooperation under variable availability of resources.

AB  - Missov and Lenart (2013) derived closed-form solutions to the life expectancy and remaining life expectancy at age x when the mortality is governed by a Gompertz-Makeham hazard, which is a parametric model commonly applied to human mortality data at adult and old ages. However, the closed-form expressions provided by these authors are not correct. We provide, therefore, valid and correct expressions using elementary calculus. We also consider numerical studies using real data to show that the formulas we provide deliver satisfactory results. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - We present a method for inductively determining exact allele frequency spectrum (AFS) probabilities for samples derived from a population comprising two demes under the infinite-allele model of mutation. This method builds on a labeled coalescent argument to extend the Ewens sampling formula (ESF) to structured populations. A key departure from the panmictic case is that the AFS conditioned on the number of alleles in the sample is no longer independent of the scaled mutation rate (theta). In particular, biallelic site frequency spectra, widely-used in explorations of genome-wide patterns of variation, depend on the mutation rate in structured populations. Variation in the rate of substitution across loci and through time may contribute to apparent distortions of site frequency spectra exhibited by samples derived from structured populations.

AB  - Unlike other biological populations, the human population is experiencing long-run increases in life expectancy. Those lead to changes in age compositions not typical for other biological populations. Sanderson and Scherbov (2015a) demonstrated that, in many countries in Europe, faster increases in life expectancy lead to faster population aging when measured using the old-age dependency ratio and to slower population aging when measured using the prospective old-age dependency ratio that employs a dynamic old-age threshold. We examine this finding analytically and with simulations. We use an analytic decomposition of changes in mortality schedules into shift and compression processes. We show that shifts and compressions of mortality schedules push the two old-age dependency ratios in opposite directions. Our formal results are supported by simulations that show a positive effect of a mortality shift on the old-age dependency ratio and a negative effect of it on the prospective old-age dependency ratio. The effects are of opposite sign for a mortality compression. Our formal and simulation results generalize observed European trends and suggest that the inverse relationship between life expectancy and prospective old-age dependency would be observed more generally.

AB  - In recent years, a number of methods have been developed to infer complex demographic histories, especially historical population size changes, from genomic sequence data. Coalescent Hidden Markov Models have proven to be particularly useful for this type of inference. Due to the Markovian structure of these models, an essential building block is the joint distribution of local genealogical trees, or statistics of these genealogies, at two neighboring loci in populations of variable size. Here, we present a novel method to compute the marginal and the joint distribution of the total length of the genealogical trees at two loci separated by at most one recombination event for samples of arbitrary size. To our knowledge, no method to compute these distributions has been presented in the literature to date. We show that they can be obtained from the solution of certain hyperbolic systems of partial differential equations. We present a numerical algorithm, based on the method of characteristics, that can be used to efficiently and accurately solve these systems and compute the marginal and the joint distributions. We demonstrate its utility to study the properties of the joint distribution. Our flexible method can be straightforwardly extended to handle an arbitrary fixed number of recombination events, to include the distributions of other statistics of the genealogies as well, and can also be applied in structured populations.

AB  - The mean pairwise genetic distance among haplotypes is an estimator of the population mutation rate theta and a standard measure of variation in a population. With the advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) methods, this and other population parameters can be estimated under different modes of sampling. One approach is to sequence individual genomes with high coverage, and to calculate genetic distance over all sample pairs. The second approach, typically used for microbial samples or for tumor cells, is sequencing a large number of pooled genomes with very low individual coverage. With low coverage, pairwise genetic distances are calculated across independently sampled sites rather than across individual genomes. In this study, we show that the variance in genetic distance estimates is reduced with low coverage sampling if the mean pairwise linkage disequilibrium weighted by allele frequencies is positive. Practically, this means that if on average the most frequent alleles over pairs of loci are in positive linkage disequilibrium, low coverage sequencing results in improved estimates of theta, assuming similar per-site read depths. We show that this result holds under the expected distribution of allele frequencies and linkage disequilibria for an infinite sites model at mutation-drift equilibrium. From simulations, we find that the conditions for reduced variance only fail to hold in cases where variant alleles are few and at very low frequency. These results are applied to haplotype frequencies from a lung cancer tumor to compute the weighted linkage disequilibria and the expected error in estimated genetic distance using high versus low coverage.

AB  - The game-theoretic model in this paper provides micro-foundations for the effect a harsher environment on the probability of cooperation among multiple players. The harshness of the environment is alternatively measured by the degree of complementarity between the players' cooperative efforts in producing a public good, and by the number of attacks on an existing public good that the players can collectively defend, where it is shown that these two measures of the degree of adversity facing the players operate in a similar fashion. We show that the effect of the degree of adversity on the probability of cooperation is monotonous, and has an opposite sign for smaller and for larger cooperation costs. For intermediate cooperation costs, we show that the effect of a harsher environment on the probability of cooperation is hill-shaped. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - We study a continuous time model for the frequency distribution of an infinitely large asexual population in which both beneficial and deleterious mutations occur and fitness is additive. When beneficial mutations are ignored, the exact solution for the frequency distribution is known to be a Poisson distribution. Here we include beneficial mutations and obtain exact expressions for the frequency distribution at all times using an eigenfunction expansion method. We find that the stationary distribution is non-Poissonian and related to the Bessel function of the first kind. We also provide suitable approximations for the stationary distribution and the time to relax to the steady state. Our exact results, especially at mutation-selection equilibrium, can be useful in developing semi-deterministic approaches to understand stochastic evolution. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Theoretical approaches are essential to our understanding of the complex dynamics of mobile genetic elements (MGEs) within genomes. Recently, the birth-death-diversification model was developed to describe the dynamics of mobile promoters (MPs), a particular class of MGEs in prokaryotes. A unique feature of this model is that genetic diversification of elements was included. To explore the implications of diversification on the longterm fate of MGE lineages, in this contribution we analyze the extinction probabilities, extinction times and equilibrium solutions of the birth-death-diversification model. We find that diversification increases both the survival and growth rate of MGE families, but the strength of this effect depends on the rate of horizontal gene transfer (HGT). We also find that the distribution of MGE families per genome is not necessarily monotonically decreasing, as observed for MPs, but may have a peak in the distribution that is related to the HGT rate. For MPs specifically, we find that new families have a high extinction probability, and predict that the number of MPs is increasing, albeit at a very slow rate. Additionally, we develop an extension of the birth-death-diversification model which allows MGEs in different regions of the genome, for example coding and non-coding, to be described by different rates. This extension may offer a potential explanation as to why the majority of MPs are located in non-promoter regions of the genome. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The protozoan Toxoplasma gondii is a parasite often found in wild and domestic cats, and it is the cause of the disease toxoplasmosis. More than 60 million people in the United States carry the parasite, and the Centers for Disease Control have placed toxoplasmosis in their disease classification group Neglected Parasitic Infections as one of five parasitic diseases targeted as priorities for public health action. In recent years, there has been significant progress toward the development of a practical vaccine, so vaccination programs may soon be a viable approach to controlling the disease. Anticipating the availability of a toxoplasmosis vaccine, we are interested in determining when cat owners should vaccinate their own pets. We have created a mathematical model describing the conditions under which vaccination is advantageous. Our model can be used to predict the average vaccination level in the population. We find that there is a critical vaccine cost threshold above which no one will use the vaccine. A vaccine cost slightly below this threshold, however, results in high usage of the vaccine, and consequently in a significant reduction in population seroprevalence. Not surprisingly, we find that populations may achieve herd immunity only if the cost of vaccine is zero. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - In a randomly-mating biparental population of size N there are, with high probability, individuals who are genealogical ancestors of every extant individual within approximately log(2) (N) generations into the past. We use this result of]. Chang to prove a curious corollary under standard models of recombination: there exist, with high probability, individuals within a constant multiple of log2 (N) generations into the past who are simultaneously (i) genealogical ancestors of each of the individuals at the present, and (ii) genetic ancestors to none of the individuals at the present. Such ancestral individuals - ancestors of everyone today that left no genetic trace - represent 'ghost' ancestors in a strong sense. In this short note, we use simple analytical argument and simulations to estimate how many such individuals exist in finite Wright-Fisher populations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Tests of the neutral evolution hypothesis are usually built on the standard null model which assumes that mutations are neutral and the population size remains constant over time. However, it is unclear how such tests are affected if the last assumption is dropped. Here, we extend the unifying framework for tests based on the site frequency spectrum, introduced by Achaz and Ferretti, to populations of varying size. Key ingredients are the first two moments of the site frequency spectrum. We show how these moments can be computed analytically if a population has experienced two instantaneous size changes in the past. We apply our method to data from ten human populations gathered in the 1000 genomes project, estimate their demographies and define demography-adjusted versions of Tajima's D, Fay & Wu's H, and Zeng's E. Our results show that demography-adjusted test statistics facilitate the direct comparison between populations and that most of the differences among populations seen in the original unadjusted tests can be explained by their underlying demographies. Upon carrying out whole-genome screens for deviations from neutrality, we identify candidate regions of recent positive selection. We provide track files with values of the adjusted and unadjusted tests for upload to the UCSC genome browser. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Quantitative estimates of growth rates can augment ecological and paleontological applications of bodysize data. However, in contrast to body-size estimates, assessing growth rates is often time-consuming, expensive, or unattainable. Here we use an indirect approach, a jackknife-corrected parametric bootstrap, for efficient approximation of growth rates using nearest living relatives with known age-size relationships. The estimate is developed by (1) collecting a sample of published growth rates of closely related species, (2) calculating the average growth curve using those published age-size relationships, (3) resampiing iteratively these empirically known growth curves to estimate the standard errors and confidence bands around the average growth curve, and (4) applying the resulting estimate of uncertainty to bracket age-size relationships of the species of interest. This approach was applied to three monophyletic families (Donacidae, Mactridae, and Semelidae) of mollusk bivalves, a group characterized by indeterministic shell growth, but widely used in ecological, paleontological, and geochemical research. The resulting indirect estimates were tested against two previously published geochemical studies and, in both cases, yielded highly congruent age estimates. In addition, a case study in applied fisheries was used to illustrate the potential of the proposed approach for augmenting aquaculture management practices. The resulting estimates of growth rates place body size data in a constrained temporal context and confidence intervals associated with resampling estimates allow for assessing the statistical uncertainty around derived temporal ranges. The indirect approach should allow for improved evaluation of diverse research questions, from sustainability of industrial shellfish harvesting to climatic interpretations of stable isotope proxies extracted from fossil skeletons.

AB  - We consider the genealogy of a sample of individuals taken from a spatially structured population when the variance of the offspring distribution is relatively large. The space is structured into discrete sites of a graph G. If the population size at each site is large, spatial coalescents with multiple mergers, so called spatial Lambda-coalescents, for which ancestral lines migrate in space and coalesce according to some Lambda-coalescent mechanism, are shown to be appropriate approximations to the genealogy of a sample of individuals.
   We then consider as the graph G the two dimensional torus with side length 2L + 1 and show that as L tends to infinity, and time is rescaled appropriately, the partition structure of spatial Lambda-coalescents of individuals sampled far enough apart converges to the partition structure of a non-spatial Kingman coalescent. From a biological point of view this means that in certain circumstances both the spatial structure as well as larger variances of the underlying offspring distribution are harder to detect from the sample. However, supplemental simulations show that for moderately large L the different structure is still evident. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Evolutionary branching is analysed in a stochastic, individual-based population model under mutation and selection. In such models, the common assumption is that individual reproduction and life career are characterised by values of a trait, and also by population sizes, and that mutations lead to small changes e in trait value. Then, traditionally, the evolutionary dynamics is studied in the limit epsilon -> 0. In the present approach, small but non-negligible mutational steps are considered. By means of theoretical analysis in the limit of infinitely large populations, as well as computer simulations, we demonstrate how discrete mutational steps affect the patterns of evolutionary branching. We also argue that the average time to the first branching depends in a sensitive way on both mutational step size and population size. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this paper, we investigate a finite population undergoing evolution through an island model with partial dispersal and without mutation, where generations are discrete and non-overlapping. The population is structured into D demes, each containing N individuals of two possible types, A and B, whose viability coefficients, s(A) and s(B), respectively, vary randomly from one generation to the next. We assume that the means, variances and covariance of the viability coefficients are inversely proportional to the number of demes D, while higher-order moments are negligible in comparison to 1/D. We use a discrete-time Markov chain with two timescales to model the evolutionary process, and we demonstrate that as the number of demes D approaches infinity, the accelerated Markov chain converges to a diffusion process for any deme size N >= 2. This diffusion process allows us to evaluate the fixation probability of type A following its introduction as a single mutant in a population that was fixed for type B. We explore the impact of increasing the variability in the viability coefficients on this fixation probability. At least when N is large enough, it is shown that increasing this variability for type B or decreasing it for type A leads to an increase in the fixation probability of a single A. The effect of the population-scaled variances, sigma(2)(A) and sigma(2)(B), can even cancel the effects of the population-scaled means, mu(A) and mu(B). We also show that the fixation probability of a single A increases as the deme-scaled migration rate increases. Moreover, this probability is higher for type A than for type B if the population-scaled geometric mean viability coefficient is higher for type A than for type B, which means that mu(A )- sigma(2)(A)/2>mu(B )- sigma(2)(B)/2.

AB  - Muller's ratchet, in its prototype version, models a haploid, asexual population whose size N is constant over the generations. Slightly deleterious mutations are acquired along the lineages at a constant rate, and individuals carrying less mutations have a selective advantage. The classical variant considers fitness proportional selection, but other fitness schemes are conceivable as well. Inspired by the work of Etheridge et al. (2009) we propose a parameter scaling which fits well to the "near-critical" regime that was in the focus of Etheridge et al. (2009) (and in which the mutation-selection ratio diverges logarithmically as N -> infinity). Using a Moran model, we investigate the "rule of thumb" given in Etheridge et al. (2009) for the click rate of the "classical ratchet" by putting it into the context of new results on the long-time evolution of the size of the best class of the ratchet with (binary) tournament selection. This variant of Muller's ratchet was introduced in Gonz & aacute;lez Casanova et al. (2023), and was analysed there in a subcritical parameter regime. Other than that of the classical ratchet, the size of the best class of the tournament ratchet follows an autonomous dynamics up to the time of its extinction. It turns out that, under a suitable correspondence of the model parameters, this dynamics coincides with the so called Poisson profile approximation of the dynamics of the best class of the classical ratchet.

AB  - This paper examines the stability of the Rosenzweig-MacArthur model distributed to identical discrete habitat patches. Migration between patches is assumed to follow the non-diffusive rule that individuals have a fixed rate of leaving their local habitat patch and migrating to another. Under this non-diffusive migration rule, we found that population dispersal on a non-regular and connected habitat network can both stabilize and destabilize the Rosenzweig-MacArthur model. It is also shown that our non-diffusive migration rule apparently becomes diffusive if the habitat network is regular. (c) 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The Kingman coalescent process is a classical model of gene genealogies in population genetics. It generates Yule-distributed, binary ranked tree topologies - also called histories - with a finite number of n leaves, together with n - 1 exponentially distributed time lengths: one for each layer of the history. Using a discrete approach, we study the lengths of the external branches of Yule distributed histories, where the length of an external branch is defined as the rank of its parent node. We study the multiplicity of external branches of given length in a random history of n leaves. A correspondence between the external branches of the ordered histories of size n and the non-peak entries of the permutations of size n - 1 provides easy access to the length distributions of the first and second longest external branches in a random Yule history and coalescent tree of size n. The length of the longest external branch is also studied in dependence of root balance of a random tree. As a practical application, we compare the observed and expected number of mutations on the longest external branches in samples from natural populations. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The population differentiation statistic F-ST, introduced by Sewall Wright, is often treated as a pairwise distance measure between populations. As was known to Wright, however, F-ST is not a true metric because allele frequencies exist for which it does not satisfy the triangle inequality. We prove that a stronger result holds: for biallelic markers whose allele frequencies differ across three populations, F-ST never satisfies the triangle inequality. We study the deviation from the triangle inequality as a function of the allele frequencies of three populations, identifying the frequency vector at which the deviation is maximal. We also examine the implications of the failure of the triangle inequality for four-point conditions for placement of groups of four populations on evolutionary trees. Next, we study the extent to which F-ST fails to satisfy the triangle inequality in human genomic data, finding that some loci produce deviations near the maximum. We provide results describing the consequences of the theory for various types of data analysis, including multidimensional scaling and inference of neighbor-joining trees from pairwise F-ST matrices.

AB  - We investigate a new approach for identifying the contribution of horizontal transmission between groups to cross-cultural similarity. This method can be applied to datasets that record the presence or absence of artefacts, or attributes thereof, in archaeological and ethnographic assemblages, from which popularity spectra can be constructed. Based on analytical and simulation models, we show that the form of such spectra is sensitive to horizontal transmission between groups. We then fit the analytical model to existing datasets by Bayesian MCMC and obtain evidence for strong horizontal transmission in oceanic as opposed to continental datasets. We check the validity of our statistical method by using individual-based models, and show that the vertical transmission rate tends to be underestimated if the datasets are obtained from lattice-structured rather than island-structured meta-populations. We also suggest that there may be more borrowing of functional than stylistic traits, although the evidence for this is currently ambiguous. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Tree shape statistics are important for investigating evolutionary mechanisms mediating phylogenetic trees. As a step towards bridging shape statistics between rooted and unrooted trees, we present a comparison study on two subtree statistics known as numbers of cherries and pitchforks for the proportional to distinguishable arrangements (PDA) and the Yule-Harding-Kingman (YHK) models. Based on recursive formulas on the joint distribution of the number of cherries and that of pitchforks, it is shown that cherry distributions are log-concave for both rooted and unrooted trees under these two models. Furthermore, the mean number of cherries and that of pitchforks for unrooted trees converge respectively to those for rooted trees under the YHK model while there exists a limiting gap of 1/4 for the PDA model. Finally, the total variation distances between the cherry distributions of rooted and those of unrooted trees converge for both models. Our results indicate that caution is required for conducting statistical analysis for tree shapes involving both rooted and unrooted trees. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Predator interference is a form of competition between predator individuals over access to their prey. There is broad empirical evidence for interference to exist in different strengths in various types of ecological communities. At the same time, parasites are increasingly recognized to alter food web structure and dynamics. In order to investigate the eco-epidemiological interplay between interference and infection, we develop and analyze mathematical models of a predator-prey system, where the predators are subject to both interference and infectious disease. In the absence of infection, equilibrium predator density is known to show a non-monotonic response to interference by first increasing and then decreasing with increasing interference levels. We show that predator infection can change this pattern into a monotonically decreasing predator response to interference, provided the transmissibility is large enough and the pathogenicity is moderate such that the impact of disease on host population density prevails over interference effects. This holds for both types of disease transmission studied here, density-dependent and frequency-dependent. For density-dependent transmission, we find that intermediate values of interference can facilitate disease persistence, whereas the disease would disappear for small or large interference levels. By contrast, for frequency-dependent transmission, disease emergence is independent of interference levels. These dynamic interactions may be important for the understanding of potential biocontrol measures and of spread patterns of zoonotic diseases. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Probability modelling for DNA sequence evolution is well established and provides a rich framework for understanding genetic variation between samples of individuals from one or more populations. We show that both classical and more recent models for coalescence (with or without recombination) can be described in terms of the so-called phase-type theory, where complicated and tedious calculations are circumvented by the use of matrix manipulations. The application of phase-type theory in population genetics consists of describing the biological system as a Markov model by appropriately setting up a state space and calculating the corresponding intensity and reward matrices. Formulae of interest are then expressed in terms of these aforementioned matrices. We illustrate this procedure by a number of examples: (a) Calculating the mean, (co)variance and even higher order moments of the site frequency spectrum in multiple merger coalescent models, (b) Analysing a sample of DNA sequences from the Atlantic Cod using the Beta-coalescent, and (c) Determining the correlation of the number of segregating sites for multiple samples in the two-locus ancestral recombination graph. We believe that phase-type theory has great potential as a tool for analysing probability models in population genetics. The compact matrix notation is useful for clarification of current models, and in particular their formal manipulation and calculations, but also for further development or extensions.

AB  - I analyze the joint impact of directional and fluctuating selection with reversible mutation in finite biallelic haploid populations using diffusion approximations of the Moran and chemostat models. Results differ dramatically from those of the classic Wright-Fisher diffusion. There, a strong dispersive effect attributable to fluctuating selection dissipates nascent polymorphisms promoted by a relatively weak emergent frequency dependent selective effect. The dispersive effect in the Moran diffusion with fluctuations every birth-death event is trivial. The same frequency dependent selective effect now dominates and polymorphism is promoted. The dispersive effect in the chemostat diffusion with fluctuations every generation is identical to that in the Wright-Fisher diffusion. Nevertheless, polymorphism is again promoted because the emergent frequency dependent effect is doubled, an effect attributable to geometric reproduction within generations. Fluctuating selection in the Moran and chemostat diffusions can also promote bi-allelic polymorphisms when one allele confers a net benefit. Rapid fluctuations within generations are highly effective at promoting polymorphism in large populations. The bi-allelic distribution is approximately Gaussian but becomes uniform and then U-shaped as the frequency of environmental fluctuations decreases to once a generation and then once every multiple generations. Trade-offs (negative correlations in fitness) help promote polymorphisms but are not essential. In all three models the frequency dependent effect raises the probability of ultimate fixation of new alleles, but less effectively in the Wright-Fisher diffusion. Individual-based forward simulations confirm the calculations. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - We propose a model for the growth of microbial populations in the presence of a rate -limiting nutrient which accounts for the switching of cells to a dormant phase at low densities in response to decreasing concentration of a putative biochemical signal. We then show that in conditions of nutrient starvation, self -sustained oscillations can occur, thus providing a natural explanation for such phenomena as plankton blooms. However, unlike results of previous studies, the microbial population minima do not become unrealistically small, being buffered during minima by an increased dormant phase population. We also show that this allows microbes to survive in extreme environments for very long periods, consistent with observation. The mechanism provides a natural vehicle for other such sporadic outbreaks, such as viral epidemics. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this paper we are concerned with the analytical description of the change in floristic composition (species turnover) with the distance between two plots of a tropical rainforest due to the clustering of the individuals of the different species. We describe the plant arrangement by a superposition of spatial point processes and in this framework we introduce an analytical function which represents the average spatial density of the Sorensen similarity between two infinitesimal plots at distance r. We see that the decay in similarity with the distance is essentially described by the pair correlation function of the superposed process and that it is governed by the most abundant species. We test our analytical model with empirical data obtained for the Barro Colorado Island and Pasoh rainforests. To this end we adopt the statistical estimator for the pair correlation function in Shimatani (2001) and we design a novel one for the Sorensen similarity. Furthermore, we test our analytical formula by modeling the forest study area with Neyman-Scott point processes. We conclude comparing the advantages of our approach with other ones existing in literature. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The risk of antibiotic resistance evolution in parasites is a major problem for public health. Identifying factors which promote antibiotic resistance evolution is thus a priority in evolutionary medicine. The rate at which new mutations enter the parasite population is one important predictor; however, mutation rate is not necessarily a fixed quantity, as is often assumed, but can itself evolve. Here we explore the possible impacts of mutation rate evolution on the fate of a disease circulating in a host population, which is being treated with drugs, the use of which varies over time. Using an evolutionary rescue framework, we find that mutation rate evolution provides a dramatic increase in the probability that a parasite population survives treatment in only a limited region, while providing little or no advantage in other regions. Both epidemiological features, such as the virulence of infection, and population genetic parameters, such as recombination rate, play important roles in determining the probability of evolutionary rescue and whether mutation rate evolution enhances the probability of evolutionary rescue or not. While efforts to curtail mutation rate evolution in parasites may be worthwhile under some circumstances, our results suggest that this need not always be the case. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - We address the problem of determining the stationary distribution of the multi-allelic, neutral-evolution Wright-Fisher model in the diffusion limit. A full solution to this problem for an arbitrary K x K mutation rate matrix involves solving for the stationary solution of a forward Kolmogorov equation over a (K 1) dimensional simplex, and remains intractable. In most practical situations mutations rates are slow on the scale of the diffusion limit and the solution is heavily concentrated on the corners and edges of the simplex. In this paper we present a practical approximate solution for slow mutation rates in the form of a set of line densities along the edges of the simplex. The method of solution relies on parameterising the general non-reversible rate matrix as the sum of a reversible part and a set of (K - 1) (K - 2) / 2 independent terms corresponding to fluxes of probability along closed paths around faces of the simplex. The solution is potentially a first step in estimating non-reversible evolutionary rate matrices from observed allele frequency spectra. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Spatial interactions are widely acknowledged to play a significant role in sustaining diversity in ecological communities. However, theoretical work on this topic has focused on how spatial processes affect coexistence of species that differ in their strategies, with less attention to how spatial processes matter when competitors are equivalent. Furthermore, though it is recognized that models with local dispersal and local competition may sustain higher diversities of equivalent competitors than models in which these are not both localized, there is debate as to whether this reflects merely equalizing effects or whether there is also a stabilizing component. In this study, we explore how dispersal limitation and nonspecific local competition influence the outcome of species coexistence in communities driven by stochastic drift. We demonstrate that space alone acts as a stabilizing factor in a continuous space model with local dispersal and competition, as individuals of rare species on average experience lower total neighborhood densities, causing per capita reproductive rates to decrease systematically with increasing abundance. These effects prolong time to extinction in a closed system and enhance species diversity in an open system with constant immigration. Fundamentally, these stabilizing effects are obtained when dispersal limitation interacts with local competition to generate fluctuations in population growth rates. Thus this effect can be considered a fluctuating mechanism similar to spatial or temporal storage effects, but generated purely endogenously without requiring any exogenous environmental variability or species dissimilarities.

AB  - Most models for the evolution of mutation under frequency-dependent selection involve some form of host-parasite interaction. These generally involve cyclic dynamics under which mutation may increase. Here we show that the reduction principle for the evolution of mutation, which is generally true for frequency-independent selection, also holds under frequency-dependent selection on haploids and diploids that does not involve cyclic dynamics.

AB  - We study a two-locus model of intersexual selection in a finite haploid population reproducing according to a discrete-time Moran model with a trait locus expressed in males and a preference locus expressed in females. We show that the probability of ultimate fixation of a single mutant allele for a male ornament introduced at random at the trait locus given any initial frequency state at the preference locus is increased by weak intersexual selection and recombination, weak or strong. Moreover, this probability exceeds the initial frequency of the mutant allele even in the case of a costly male ornament if intersexual selection is not too weak. On the other hand, the probability of ultimate fixation of a single mutant allele for a female preference towards a male ornament introduced at random at the preference locus is increased by weak intersexual selection and weak recombination if the female preference is not costly, and is strong enough in the case of a costly male ornament. The analysis relies on an extension of the ancestral recombination-selection graph for samples of haplotypes to take into account events of intersexual selection, while the symbolic calculation of the fixation probabilities is made possible in a reasonable time by an optimizing algorithm.

AB  - Vegetation patch-size distributions have been an intense area of study for theoreticians and applied ecologists alike in recent years. Of particular interest is the seemingly ubiquitous nature of power-law patch-size distributions emerging in a number of diverse ecosystems. The leading explanation of the emergence of these power-laws is due to local facilitative mechanisms. There is also a common transition from power law to exponential distribution when a system is under global pressure, such as grazing or lack of rainfall. These phenomena require a simple mechanistic explanation. Here, we study vegetation patches from a spatially implicit, patch dynamic viewpoint. We show that under minimal assumptions a power law patch-size distribution appears as a natural consequence of aggregation. A linear death term also leads to an exponential term in the distribution for any non-zero death rate. This work shows the origin of the breakdown of the power-law under increasing pressure and shows that in general, we expect to observe a power law with an exponential cutoff (rather than pure power laws). The estimated parameters of this distribution also provide insight into the underlying ecological mechanisms of aggregation and death. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Janzen-Connell hypothesis states that tree diversity in tropical forests is maintained by specialist predators that are distance- or density-responsive (i.e. predators that reduce seed or seedling survival near adults of their hosts). Many empirical studies have investigated whether predators are distance-responsive; however, few studies have examined whether distance-responsiveness matters for how predators maintain tree diversity. Using a site-occupancy model, we show analytically that distance-responsive predators are actually less able to maintain diversity than specialist predators that are not distance-responsive. Generally, specialist predators maintain diversity because they become rare when their host's densities are low, reducing predation risk. However, if predators are distance-responsive, and most seeds cannot disperse away from these predators, then seed predation rates will remain high, even if predator density is low across the landscape. Consequently, a reduction in a host's population density may not lead to a significant reduction in seed and seedling predation. We show that habitat partitioning can cause recruitment to be highest near conspecific adults, even in the presence of distance-responsive predators, without any change in the effect that the predators have on coexistence (a result contrary to predictions of the Janzen-Connell hypothesis). Rather, specialist predators and habitat partitioning have additive effects on species coexistence in our model, i.e., neither mechanism alters the effect of the other one. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - In this paper, we discuss the construction of a multivariate generalisation of the Dirichlet-multinomial distribution. An example from forensic genetics in the statistical analysis of DNA mixtures motivates the study of this multivariate extension.
   In forensic genetics, adjustment of the match probabilities due to remote ancestry in the population is often done using the so-called theta-correction. This correction increases the probability of observing multiple copies of rare alleles in a subpopulation and thereby reduces the weight of the evidence for rare genotypes.
   A recent publication by Cowell et al. (2015) showed elegantly how to use Bayesian networks for efficient computations of likelihood ratios in a forensic genetic context. However, their underlying population genetic model assumed independence of alleles, which is not realistic in real populations. We demonstrate how the so-called theta-correction can be incorporated in Bayesian networks to make efficient computations by modifying the Markov structure of Cowell et al. (2015).
   By numerical examples, we show how the theta-correction incorporated in the multivariate Dirichlet-multinomial distribution affects the weight of evidence. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The propagation of a sequence in a population is traced using a branching process model of Poisson distributions. The sequence, initially inserted in a location of the genome of a single individual, is under selective pressure and can undergo detrimental, beneficial or even neutral mutations that allow for adaptive possibilities in the future. The exact solution for the ultimate probability of fixation (u) of the sequence in this model is a Lambert W function of mutation rates and selective values:
   u = 1 + W(-gamma . e(-(gamma+beta)))/gamma.
   where y = 1 + s - mu(d) - mu(b) beta = 2 alpha mu(b), s is the intrinsic coefficient of selection of the sequence (selective advantage is set by s > 0), mu(d) and mu(b) are the deleterious and beneficial rates of mutations that occur in the sequence and a is the effect of beneficial mutations. Predictions are adaptable to a wide range of situations, e.g., fixation of favourable mutations, local mutators or gene duplicates.
   The equation for the probability of fixation can be recursively nested, which leads to a non-obvious conclusion: the ultimate probability of fixation of the favourable combination of a number of rare events occurring in the sequence is not the product of the individual probabilities of the events but tends to be approximately proportional to the product of their square roots, which results in a remarkably high chance of fixation. This conclusion has implications in several topics of evolutionary genetics. The analysis also gives the distribution of the times of occurrence of the beneficial mutations that will lead to sequence fixation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The mathematical study of genealogies has yielded important insights in population biology, such as the ability to estimate the time to the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of a sample of genetic sequences or of a group of individuals. Here we introduce a model of cultural genealogies that is a step toward answering similar questions for cultural traits. In our model individuals can inherit from a variable, potentially large number of ancestors, rather than from a fixed, small number of ancestors (one or two) as is typical of genetic evolution. We first show that, given a sample of individuals, a cultural common ancestor does not necessarily exist. We then introduce a related concept: the most recent unique ancestor (MRUA), i.e., the most recent single individual who is the earliest cultural ancestor of the sample. We show that, under neutral evolution, the time to the MRUA can be staggeringly larger than the time to MRCA in a single ancestor model, except when the average number of learning opportunities per individuals is small. Our results point out that the properties of cultural genealogies may be very different from those of genetic genealogies, with potential implications for reconstructing the histories of cultural traits.

AB  - The coupled dynamics of the size and the mean cultural/technological level of a population, with positive feedback between these two variables, is modeled in the Malthusian-Boserupian framework. Bifurcation diagrams, with innovativeness or the cultureless carrying capacity as the parameter, show that abrupt transitions in the mean cultural level are possible. For example, a gradual evolutionary change toward greater innate innovativeness would produce an associated gradual increase in mean cultural level, until a threshold is crossed that triggers an abrupt cultural regime shift. Hence, the model may help explain the apparently sudden and dramatic efflorescences of Palaeolithic/Stone Age culture during the Late Pleistocene, without having to invoke major contemporaneous genetic changes in cognition.

AB  - Introgression is the permanent incorporation of genes from the genome of one population into another. Previous studies have found that stochasticity in number of offspring, hybridisation, and environment are important aspects of introgression risk, but these factors have been studied separately. In this paper we extend the use of the hazard rate which we previously used to study effects of demographic stochasticity with repeated invasion attempts, to incorporate temporal environmental stochasticity. We find that introgression risk varies much in time, and in some periods it can be much enhanced in such environments. Furthermore, effects of plant life history parameters, such as flowering and survival probabilities, on hazard rates depend on characteristics of the environmental variation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Shared genealogies introduce allele dependences in diploid genotypes, as alleles within an individual or between different individuals will likely match when they originate from a recent common ancestor. At a locus shared by a pair of diploid individuals, there are nine combinatorially distinct modes of identity-by-descent (IBD), capturing all possible combinations of coancestry and inbreeding. A distribution over the IBD modes is described by the nine associated probabilities, known as (jacquard's) identity coefficients. The genetic relatedness between two individuals can be succinctly characterized by the identity coefficients corresponding to a pedigree that contains both individuals. The identity coefficients (together with allele frequencies) determine the distribution of joint genotypes at a locus. At a locus with two possible alleles, identity coefficients are not identifiable because different coefficients can generate the same genotype distribution.
   We analyze precisely how different IBD modes combine into identical genotype distributions at diallelic loci. In particular, we describe IBD mode mixtures that result in identical genotype distributions at all allele frequencies, implying the non-identifiability of the identity coefficients from independent loci. Our analysis yields an exhaustive characterization of relatedness statistics that are always identifiable. Importantly, we show that identifiable relatedness statistics include the kinship coefficient (probability that a random pair of alleles are identical by descent between individuals) and inbreeding-related measures, which can thus be estimated consistently from genotype distributions at independent loci.

AB  - We apply recently developed inference methods based on general coalescent processes to DNA sequence data obtained from various marine species. Several of these species are believed to exhibit so-called shallow gene genealogies, potentially due to extreme reproductive behaviour, e.g. via Hedgecock's "reproduction sweepstakes". Besides the data analysis, in particular the inference of mutation rates and the estimation of the (real) time to the most recent common ancestor, we briefly address the question whether the genealogies might be adequately described by so-called Beta-coalescents (as opposed to Kingman's coalescent), allowing multiple mergers of genealogies.
   The choice of the underlying coalescent model for the genealogy has drastic implications for the estimation of the above quantities, in particular the real-time embedding of the genealogy. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) is a single-celled, intracellular protozoan responsible for the disease toxoplasmosis. The parasite is prevalent worldwide, and it infects all warm-blooded vertebrates. Consumption of meats in which this parasite has encysted confers risk of infection to people and other animals, as does ingestion of water or foods contaminated with environmentally resistant oocysts excreted by cats. Vertical transmission (from mother to offspring) is also possible, leading to disease risk and contributing additional means of ensuring perpetuation of transmission. In this work, we adopt a differential equation model to investigate the effective transmission pathways of T. gondii, as well as potential control mechanisms. Detailed analyses are carried out to examine the significance of transmission routes, virulence, vertical transmission, parasite-induced changes in host behavior, and controls based on vaccination and harvesting. Modeling and analysis efforts may shed insights into understanding the complex life cycle of T. gondii. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Sexual selection plays a crucial role in modern evolutionary theory, offering valuable insight into evolutionary patterns and species diversity. Recently, a comprehensive definition of sexual selection has been proposed, defining it as any selection that arises from fitness differences associated with nonrandom success in the competition for access to gametes for fertilization. Previous research on discrete traits demonstrated that nonrandom mating can be effectively quantified using Jeffreys (or symmetrized Kullback-Leibler) divergence, capturing information acquired through mating influenced by mutual mating propensities instead of random occurrences. This novel theoretical framework allows for detecting and assessing the strength of sexual selection and assortative mating. In this study, we aim to achieve two primary objectives. Firstly, we demonstrate the seamless alignment of the previous theoretical development, rooted in information theory and mutual mating propensity, with the aforementioned definition of sexual selection. Secondly, we extend the theory to encompass quantitative traits. Our findings reveal that sexual selection and assortative mating can be quantified effectively for quantitative traits by measuring the information gain relative to the random mating pattern. The connection of the information indices of sexual selection with the classical measures of sexual selection is established. Additionally, if mating traits are normally distributed, the measure capturing the underlying information of assortative mating is a function of the square of the correlation coefficient, taking values within the non-negative real number set [0, +infinity). It is worth noting that the same divergence measure captures information acquired through mating for both discrete and quantitative traits. This is interesting as it provides a common context and can help simplify the study of sexual selection patterns.

AB  - Predicting temporal dynamics of genetic diversity is important for assessing long-term population persistence. In stage-structured populations, especially in perennial plant species, genetic diversity is often compared among life history stages, such as seedlings, juveniles, and flowerings, using neutral genetic markers. The comparison among stages is sometimes referred to as demographic genetic structure, which has been regarded as a proxy of potential genetic changes because individuals in mature stages will die and be replaced by those in more immature stages over the course of time. However, due to the lack of theoretical examination, the basic property of the stage-wise genetic diversity remained unclear. We developed a matrix model which was made up of difference equations of the probability of non-identical-by-descent of each life history stage at a neutral locus to describe the dynamics and the inter-stage differences of genetic diversity in stage-structured plant populations. Based on the model, we formulated demographic genetic structure as well as the annual change rate of the probability of non-identical-by-descent (denoted as eta). We checked if theoretical expectations on demographic genetic structure and eta obtained from our model agreed with computational results of stochastic simulation using randomly generated 3,000 life histories. We then examined the relationships of demographic genetic structure with effective population size Ne, which is the determinants of diversity loss per generation time. Theoretical expectations on eta and demographic genetic structure fitted well to the results of stochastic simulation, supporting the validity of our model. Demographic genetic structure varied independently of Ne and eta, while having a strong correlation with stable stage distribution: genetic diversity was lower in stages with fewer individuals. Our results indicate that demographic genetic structure strongly reflects stable stage distribution, rather than temporal genetic dynamics, and that inferring future genetic diversity solely from demographic genetic structure would be misleading. Instead of demographic genetic structure, we propose eta as an useful tool to predict genetic diversity at the same time scale as population dynamics (i.e., per year), facilitating evaluation on population viability from a genetic point of view.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - We revisit the Spatial Lambda-Fleming-Viot process introduced in Barton and Kelleher (2010). Particularly, we are interested in the time T0 to the most recent common ancestor for two lineages. We distinguish between the cases where the process acts on the two-dimensional plane and on a finite rectangle. Utilizing a differential equation linking T0 with the physical distance between the lineages, we arrive at computationally efficient and reasonably accurate approximation schemes for both cases. Furthermore, our analysis enables us to address the question of whether the genealogical process of the model "comes down from infinity", which has been partly answered before in Veber and Wakolbinger (2015).(c) 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - While facultative sex is common in sexually reproducing species, for reasons of tractability most mathematical models assume that such sex is asynchronous in the population. In this paper, we develop a model of switching environments to instead capture the effect of an entire population transitioning synchronously between sexual and asexual modes of reproduction. We use this model to investigate the evolution of the number of self-incompatible mating types in finite populations, which empirically can range from two to thousands. When environmental switching is fast, we recover the results of earlier studies that implicitly assumed populations were engaged in asynchronous sexual reproduction. However when the environment switches slowly, we see deviations from previous asynchronous theory, including a lower number of mating types at equilibrium and bimodality in the stationary distribution of mating types. We provide analytic approximations for both the fast and slow switching regimes, as well as a numerical scheme based on the Kolmogorov equations for the system to quickly evaluate the model dynamics at intermediate parameters. Our approach exploits properties of integer partitions in number theory. We also demonstrate how additional biological processes such as selective sweeps can be accounted for in this switching environment framework, showing that beneficial mutations can further erode mating type diversity in synchronous facultatively sexual populations.

AB  - The order Hymenoptera includes most of the eusocial species on the planet. Correlated is the fact that many of the social species within the order are haplodiploid and use complementary sex determination (CSD) to determine the sex of offspring. CSD is the mechanism by why single sex alleles within an organism result in male development (haploid) and mismatched sex alleles develop into females (diploids). Related to this is the production of diploid males: fertilized eggs with matched sex alleles which develop as male instead of female. Honey bees are no exception to this, and as their numbers continue to suffer globally and their genetic diversity lowers, the effects of diploid male production (DMP) may pose an increased risk to the survival of bee colonies. In the present study, we develop a model for diploid male production in a honey bee colony and show that with ample resources, this phenomena has little effect on a colony's health, but there is a limit to the sustainability of a colony suffering from diploid male production. We use our model to show that there were likely no great evolutionary pressures against CSD and DMP in wild honey bees as its effects on colony health in the wild would have been negligible but increased environmental hazards such as pesticides and monoculture crops increase the effects of DMP on colony health.

AB  - In a model of vertical and oblique cultural transmission of a dichotomous trait, the rates of transmission of each form of the trait are functions of the trait frequency in the population. Sufficient conditions on these functions are derived for a stable trait polymorphism to exist. If the vertical transmission rates are monotone decreasing functions of the trait frequency, a complete global stability analysis is presented. It is also shown that a unique protected polymorphism can be globally stable even though the sufficient conditions are not met. The evolution of frequency-dependent transmission is modeled using modifier theory, and exact conditions are derived for a transmission modifier to invade a population at a stable polymorphism. Finally, the interaction between frequency-dependent selection and frequency-dependent transmission is explored. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - A simple competition model with time varying periodic coefficients, in which two species use different reproduction strategies, is explored in this paper. The two species considered comprise a native species which reproduces once a year over a short time period and an invasive species which is capable of reproducing throughout the entire year. A monotonicity property of the model is instrumental for its analysis. The model reveals that the time difference between the peak of reproduction for the two species is a critical factor in determining the outcome of competition between these species. The impact of climate change and an anthropogenic disturbance, comprising the creation of additional substrate, is also investigated using a modified model. The results of this paper describe how climate change will favour the invasive species by reducing the time period between the reproductive peaks of the two species and how the addition of new substrates is likely to endanger a small population of either of the two species, depending on the timing of the introduction of the substrates.

AB  - For a panmictic population of constant size evolving under neutrality, Kingman's coalescent describes the genealogy of a population sample in equilibrium. However, for genealogical trees under selection, not even expectations for most basic quantities like height and length of the resulting random tree are known. Here, we give an analytic expression for the distribution of the total tree length of a sample of size n under low levels of selection in a two-alleles model. We can prove that trees are shorter than under neutrality under genic selection and if the beneficial mutant has dominance h < 1/2, but longer for h > 1/2. The difference from neutrality is O(alpha(2)) for genic selection with selection intensity alpha and O(alpha) for other modes of dominance. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Reciprocal monophyly, a feature of a genealogy in which multiple groups of descendant lineages each consist of all of the descendants of their respective most recent common ancestors, has been an important concept in studies of species delimitation, phylogeography, population history reconstruction, systematics, and conservation. Computations involving the probability that reciprocal monophyly is observed in a genealogy have played a key role in criteria for defining taxonomic groups and inferring divergence times. The probability of reciprocal monophyly under a coalescent model of population divergence has been studied in detail for groups of gene lineages for pairs of species. Here, we extend this computation to generate corresponding probabilities for sets of gene lineages from three and four species. We study the effects of model parameters on the probability of reciprocal monophyly, finding that it is driven primarily by species tree height, with lesser but still substantial influences of internal branch lengths and sample sizes. We also provide an example application of our results to data from maize and teosinte. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - An individual-based model is presented which shows that cyclic insects outbreaks in the forest (here presented as a certain type of the dynamics of total numbers of insects in the forest) can be a result of the joint action of four factors: (1) spatial structure of the system - resources, green tree biomass, used by larval insects are distributed in a two-dimensional space, (2) properties of trees - their limited resistance to feeding by insects, and regeneration ability after some time of relaxation, when they cannot sustain a local insect population, (3) insect properties - the most important of which is the ability of adult individuals to move between spatially distributed resources and to lay eggs on neighbouring trees, and (4) the type of dynamics of local insect population exploiting resources of a tree, which depends on individual variability of insects and their progeny production. Insects disperse from the original tree and occupy successive not infested trees over the forest, omitting the trees with exploited resources that need time for regeneration. The cyclic outbreak dynamics will take place when insects have opportunity to return to the places where there are trees with regenerated resources. In addition to the cyclic outbreak, we will observe permanent outbreaks (small fluctuations of insect, combined with a similar dynamics of tree biomass) or pulse outbreaks (an increase in the number of insects, followed by their extinction and leading to a temporary destruction of tree biomass). The type of the simulation output will depend on the values of the model parameters. Intermediate resistance of trees to insect feeding and their not very short regeneration time will lead to cyclic outbreaks. Additionally great number of dispersing insects will promote cyclic outbreaks. High degree of individual variability, high mortality of adult insects or small progeny production will produce favourable conditions for permanent outbreaks. Pulse outbreaks can easily occur when insect individual variability is small or progeny production is high. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Many statistics that examine genetic variation depend on the underlying shapes of genealogical trees. Under the coalescent model, we investigate the joint distribution of two quantities that describe genealogical tree shape: tree height and tree length. We derive a recursive formula for their exact joint distribution under a demographic model of a constant-sized population. We obtain approximations for the mean and variance of the ratio of tree height to tree length, using them to show that this ratio converges in probability to 0 as the sample size increases. We find that as the sample size increases, the correlation coefficient for tree height and length approaches (pi(2) - 6)/[pi root 2 pi(2) - 18] approximate to 0.9340. Using simulations, we examine the joint distribution of height and length under demographic models with population growth and population subdivision. We interpret the joint distribution in relation to problems of interest in data analysis, including inference of the time to the most recent common ancestor. The results assist in understanding the influences of demographic histories on two fundamental features of tree shape. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - In many areas of genetics it is of relevance to consider a population of individuals that is founded by a single individual in the past. One model for such a scenario is the conditioned reconstructed process with Bernoulli sampling that describes the evolution of a population of individuals that originates from a single individual. Several aspects of this reconstructed process are studied, in particular the Markov structure of the process. It is shown that at any given time in the past, the conditioned reconstructed process behaves as the original conditioned reconstructed process after a suitable time-dependent change of the sampling probability. Additionally, it is discussed how mutations accumulate in a sample of particles. It is shown that random sampling of particles at the present time has the effect of making the mutation rate look time-dependent. Conditions are given under which this sampling effect is negligible. A possible extension of the reconstructed process that allows for multiple founding particles is discussed. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Ancestry-informative markers (AIMs) are markers that give information about the ancestry of individuals. They are used in forensic genetics for predicting the geographic origin of the investigated individual in crime and identification cases. In the exploration of the genogeographic origin of an AIMs profile, the likelihoods of the AIMs profile in various populations may be calculated. However, there may not be an appropriate reference population in the database. The fact that the likelihood ratio (LR) of one population compared to that of another population is large does not imply that any of the populations is relevant.
   To handle this phenomena, we derived a likelihood ratio test (LRT) that is a measure of absolute concordance between an AIMs profile and a population rather than a relative measure of the AIMs profile's likelihood in two populations. The LRT is similar to a Fisher's exact test. By aggregating over markers, the central limit theorem suggests that the resulting quantity is approximately normally distributed. If only a few markers are genotyped or if the majority of the markers are fixed in a given population, the approximation may fail. We overcome this using importance sampling and show how exponential tilting results in an efficient proposal distribution.
   By simulations and published AIMs profiles, we demonstrate the applicability of the derived methodology. For the genotyped AIMs, the LRT approach achieves the nominal levels of rejection when tested on data from five major continental regions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - In most matrix population projection models, individuals are characterized according to, usually, one or two traits such as age, stage, size or location. A broad theory of multitrait population projection matrices (MPPMs) incorporating larger number of traits was long held back by time and space computational complexity issues. As a consequence, no study has yet focused on the influence of the structure of traits describing a life-cycle on population dynamics and life-history evolution.
   We present here a novel vector-based MPPM building methodology that allows to computationally efficiently model populations characterized by numerous traits with large distributions, and extend sensitivity analyses for these models. We then present a new method, the trait level analysis consisting in folding an MPPM on any of its traits to create a matrix with alternative trait structure (the number of traits and their characteristics) but similar asymptotic properties. Adding or removing one or several traits to/from the MPPM and analyzing the resulting changes in spectral properties, allows investigating the influence of the trait structure on the evolution of traits.
   We illustrate this by modeling a 3-trait (age, parity and fecundity) population designed to investigate the implications of parity-fertility trade-offs in a context of fecundity heterogeneity in humans. The trait level analysis, comparing models of the same population differing in trait structures, demonstrates that fertility selection gradients differ between cases with or without parity-fertility trade-offs. Moreover it shows that age-specific fertility has seemingly very different evolutionary significance depending on whether heterogeneity is accounted for. This is because trade-offs can vary strongly in strength and even direction depending on the trait structure used to model the population. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The role of environmental heterogeneity in the evolution of biological diversity has been studied only for simple types of heterogeneities and dispersals. This article broadens previous results by considering heterogeneities and dispersals that are structured by several environmental factors. It studies the evolution of a metapopulation, living in a network of patches connected by dispersal, under the effects of mutation, selection and migration. First, it is assumed that patches are equally connected and that they carry habitats characterized by several factors exerting selection pressures on several individual traits. Habitat factors may vary in the environment independently or they may be correlated. It is shown that correlations between habitat factors promote adaptive diversification and that this effect may be modified by trait interactions on survival. Then, it is assumed that patches are structured by two crossed factors, called the row and column factors, such that patches are more connected when they occur in the same row or in the same column. Environmental patterns in which each habitat appears in each row the same number of times and appears in each column the same number of times are found to hinder adaptive diversification.

AB  - Understanding population dynamics from the analysis of molecular and spatial data requires sound statistical modeling. Current approaches assume that populations are naturally partitioned into discrete demes, thereby failing to be relevant in cases where individuals are scattered on a spatial continuum. Other models predict the formation of increasingly tight clusters of individuals in space, which, again, conflicts with biological evidence. Building on recent theoretical work, we introduce a new genealogy based inference framework that alleviates these issues. This approach effectively implements a stochastic model in which the distribution of individuals is homogeneous and stationary, thereby providing a relevant null model for the fluctuation of genetic diversity in time and space. Importantly, the spatial density of individuals in a population and their range of dispersal during the course of evolution are two parameters that can be inferred separately with this method. The validity of the new inference framework is confirmed with extensive simulations and the analysis of influenza sequences collected over five seasons in the USA. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Communities with different phenotypic variation among species can have identical species abundance distributions, although their temporal dynamics may be very different. By using stochastic species abundance models, both the lognormal and beta prime abundance distributions can be obtained with either homogeneous or heterogeneous dynamics among species. Assuming that anthropogenic activity disturbs the communities such that species' carrying capacities are decreasing deterministically, the structure of the communities are studied using simulations. In order to construct homogeneous communities with reasonable variation in abundance, the parameter values describing the dynamics of the species can be unrealistic in terms of long return times to equilibrium. Species in heterogeneous communities can have stronger density regulation, while maintaining the same variation in abundance, by assuming heterogeneity in one of the dynamical parameters. The heterogeneity generates variation in carrying capacity among species, while reducing the temporal stochasticity. If carrying capacity decreases, changes in community structure occur at a much slower rate for the homogeneous compared to the heterogeneous communities. Even over short time periods, the difference in response to deterministic changes in carrying capacity between homogeneous and heterogeneous community models can be substantial, making the heterogeneous model a recommended starting point for community analysis.

AB  - Pertussis, or whooping cough, is an important respiratory infection causing considerable infant mortality worldwide. Recently, incidence has risen in countries with strong vaccine programmes and there are concerns about antigenic shift resulting in vaccine evasion. Interactions between pertussis and non-vaccine-preventable strains will play an important role in the evolution and population dynamics of pertussis. In particular, if we are to understand the role strain replacement plays in vaccinated settings, it will be essential to understand how strains or variants of pertussis interact. Here we explore under what conditions we would expect strain replacement to be of concern in pertussis. We develop a dynamic transmission model that allows for coinfection between Bordetella pertussis (the main causative agent of pertussis) and a strain or variant unaffected by the vaccine. We incorporate both neutrality (in the sense of ecological/population genetic neutrality) and immunity into the model, leaving the specificity of the immune response flexible. We find that strain replacement may be considerable when immunity is non-specific. This is in contrast to previous findings where neutrality was not considered. We conclude that the extent to which models reflect ecological neutrality can have a large impact on conclusions regarding strain replacement. This will likely have onward consequences for estimates of vaccine efficacy and cost-effectiveness. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Chromosomal inversions allow genetic divergence of locally adapted populations by reducing recombination between chromosomes with different arrangements. While patterns of genetic variation within inverted regions are increasingly documented, inferential methods are largely missing to analyze such data. Previous work has provided expectations for coalescence patterns of neutral sites linked to an inversion polymorphism in two locally adapted populations. Here, we define a method to construct summary statistics in such complex population structure models. Under a scenario of selection on the inversion breakpoints, we first construct estimators of the migration rate between the two habitats, and of the recombination rate of a nucleotide site between the two inversion backgrounds. Next, we analyze the disequilibrium between two sites within an inversion and provide an estimator of the distinct recombination rate between these two sites in homokaryotypes and heterokaryotypes. These estimators should be suitable summary statistics for simulation-based methods that can handle the complex dependences in the data. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Taylor's power law of fluctuation scaling (TL) states that for population density, population abundance, biomass density, biomass abundance, cell mass, protein copy number, or any other nonnegative-valued random variable in which the mean and the variance are positive, variance = a(mean)(b), a > 0, or equivalently log variance = log a + b x log mean. Many empirical examples and practical applications of TL are known, but understanding of TL's origins and interpretations remains incomplete. We show here that, as time becomes large, TL arises from multiplicative population growth in which successive random factors are chosen by a Markov chain. We give exact formulas for a and b in terms of the Markov transition matrix and the values of the successive multiplicative factors. In this model, the mean and variance asymptotically increase exponentially if and only if b > 2 and asymptotically decrease exponentially if and only if b < 2. (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Recent developments in the inclusive fitness theory have revealed that the direction of evolution can be analytically predicted in a wider class of models than previously thought, such as those models dealing with network structure. This paper aims to provide a mathematical description of the inclusive fitness theory. Specifically, we provide a general framework based on a Markov chain that can implement basic models of inclusive fitness. Our framework is based on the probability distribution of "offspring-to-parent map", from which the key concepts of the theory, such as fitness function, relatedness and inclusive fitness, are derived in a straightforward manner. We prove theorems showing that inclusive fitness always provides a correct prediction on which of two competing genes more frequently appears in the long run in the Markov chain. As an application of the theorems, we prove a general formula of the optimal dispersal rate in the Wright's island model with recurrent mutations. We also show the existence of the critical mutation rate, which does not depend on the number of islands and below which a positive dispersal rate evolves. Our framework can also be applied to lattice or network structured populations. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - In Athreya et al. (2021), models from population genetics were used to define stochastic dynamics in the space of graphons arising as continuum limits of dense graphs. In the present paper we exhibit an example of a simple neutral population genetics model for which this dynamics is a Markovian diffusion that can be characterized as the solution of a martingale problem. In particular, we consider a Markov chain in the space of finite graphs that resembles a Moran model with resampling and mutation. We encode the finite graphs as graphemes, which can be represented as a triple consisting of a vertex set (or more generally, a topological space), an adjacency matrix, and a sampling (Borel) measure. We equip the space of graphons with convergence of sample subgraph densities and show that the grapheme -valued Markov chain converges to a grapheme -valued diffusion as the number of vertices goes to infinity. We show that the grapheme -valued diffusion has a stationary distribution that is linked to the Griffiths-Engen-McCloskey (GEM) distribution. In a companion paper (Greven et al. 2023), we build up a general theory for obtaining grapheme -valued diffusions via genealogies of models in population genetics.

AB  - Infectious disease agents can influence each other's dynamics in shared host populations. We consider such influence for two mosquito-borne infections where one pathogen is endemic at the time that a second pathogen invades. We regard a setting where the vector has a bias towards biting host individuals infected with the endemic pathogen and where there is a cost to co-infected hosts. As a motivating case study, we regard Plasmodium spp., that cause avian malaria, as the endemic pathogen, and Usutu virus (USUV) as the invading pathogen. Hosts with malaria attract more mosquitoes compared to susceptible hosts, a phenomenon named vector bias. The possible trade-off between the vector-bias effect and the co-infection mortality is studied using a compartmental epidemic model. We focus first on the basic reproduction number R0 0 for Usutu virus invading into a malaria-endemic population, and then explore the long-term dynamics of both pathogens once Usutu virus has become established. We find that the vector bias facilitates the introduction of malaria into a susceptible population, as well as the introduction of Usutu in a malaria-endemic population. In the long term, however, both a vector bias and co-infection mortality lead to a decrease in the number of individuals infected with either pathogen, suggesting that avian malaria is unlikely to be a promoter of Usutu invasion. This proposed approach is general and allows for new insights into other negative associations between endemic and invading vector-borne pathogens.

AB  - Individuals delay natal dispersal for many reasons. There may be no place to disperse to; immediate dispersal or reproduction may be too costly; immediate dispersal may mean that the individual and their relatives miss the benefits of group living. Understanding the factors that lead to the evolution of delayed dispersal is important because delayed dispersal sets the stage for complex social groups and social behavior. Here, we study the evolution of delayed dispersal when the quality of the local environment is improved by greater numbers of individuals (e.g., safety in numbers). We assume that individuals who delay natal dispersal also expect to delay personal reproduction. In addition, we assume that improved environmental quality benefits manifest as changes to fecundity and survival. We are interested in how do the changes in these life-history features affect delayed dispersal. We use a model that ties evolution to population dynamics. We also aim to understand the relationship between levels of delayed dispersal and the probability of establishing as an independent breeder (a population-level feature) in response to changes in life -history details. Our model emphasizes kin selection and considers a sexual organism, which allows us to study parent-offspring conflict over delayed dispersal. At evolutionary equilibrium, fecundity and survival benefits of group size or quality promote higher levels of delayed dispersal over a larger set of life histories with one exception. The exception is for benefits of increased group size or quality reaped by the individuals who delay dispersal. There, the increased benefit does not change the life histories supporting delay dispersal. Next, in contrast to previous predictions, we find that a low probability of establishing in a new location is not always associated with a higher incidence of delayed dispersal. Finally, we find that increased personal benefits of delayed dispersal exacerbate the conflict between parents and their offspring. We discuss our findings in relation to previous theoretical and empirical work, especially work related to cooperative breeding.

AB  - The infinitesimal model of quantitative genetics relies on the Central Limit Theorem to stipulate that under additive models of quantitative traits determined by many loci having similar effect size, the difference between an offspring's genetic trait component and the average of their two parents' genetic trait components is Normally distributed and independent of the parents' values. Here, we investigate how the assumption of similar effect sizes affects the model: if, alternatively, the tail of the effect size distribution is polynomial with exponent alpha < 2 , then a different Central Limit Theorem implies that sums of effects should be well-approximated by a "stable distribution", for which single large effects are often still important. Empirically, we first find tail exponents between 1 and 2 in effect sizes estimated by genome-wide association studies of many human disease-related traits. We then show that the independence of offspring trait deviations from parental averages in many cases implies the Gaussian aspect of the infinitesimal model, suggesting that non-Gaussian models of trait evolution must explicitly track the underlying genetics, at least for loci of large effect. We also characterize possible limiting trait distributions of the infinitesimal model with infinitely divisible noise distributions, and compare our results to simulations.

KW  - Convergence
KW  - EVOLUTION
AB  - Mathematical models of conformity and anti -conformity have commonly included a set of simplifying assumptions. For example, (1) there are m = 2 cultural variants in the population, (2) naive individuals observe the cultural variants of n = 3 adult "role models,"and (3) individuals' levels of conformity or anti -conformity do not change over time. Three recent theoretical papers have shown that departures from each of these assumptions can produce new population dynamics. Here, we explore cases in which multiple, or all, of these assumptions are violated simultaneously: namely, in a population with m variants of a trait where conformity (or anti -conformity) occurs with respect to n role models, we study a model in which the conformity rates at each generation are random variables that are independent of the variant frequencies at that generation. For this model a class of symmetric constant equilibria exist, and it is possible that all of these equilibria are simultaneously stochastically locally stable. In such cases, the effect of initial conditions on subsequent evolutionary trajectories becomes very complicated.

AB  - Distributional properties of tree shape statistics under random phylogenetic tree models play an important role in investigating the evolutionary forces underlying the observed phylogenies. In this paper, we study two subtree counting statistics, the number of cherries and that of pitchforks for the Ford model, the alpha model introduced by Daniel Ford. It is a one-parameter family of random phylogenetic tree models which includes the proportional to distinguishable arrangement (PDA) and the Yule models, two tree models commonly used in phylogenetics. Based on a non-uniform version of the extended Polya urn models in which negative entries are permitted for their replacement matrices, we obtain the strong law of large numbers and the central limit theorem for the joint distribution of these two statistics for the Ford model. Furthermore, we derive a recursive formula for computing the exact joint distribution of these two statistics. This leads to exact formulas for their means and higher order asymptotic expansions of their second moments, which allows us to identify a critical parameter value for the correlation between these two statistics. That is, when the number of tree leaves is sufficiently large, they are negatively correlated for 0 < alpha < 1/2 and positively correlated for 1/2 < alpha < 1. (c) 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Neutral models in ecology assume that all species are demographically equivalent, such that their abundances differ ultimately because of demographic stochasticity rather than selection. In spite of their simplicity, neutral models have been found to accurately reproduce static patterns of biodiversity for diverse communities. However, the same neutral models have been found to exhibit species abundance dynamics that are far too slow compared to reality, resulting in poor fits to temporally dynamic patterns of biodiversity. Here, we show that one of the root causes of these slow dynamics is the additional assumption that a community has reached an equilibrium with a fixed community size, with species that have a net growth rate close to zero. We removed this additional assumption by constructing and analyzing a neutral model with an expected community size that can change over time and is not necessarily at equilibrium, which thus allows the historical formation of a community to be represented explicitly. Our analysis demonstrated that for the general scenario where a small community rapidly grows in size to a carrying capacity, representing recovery from ecological disturbance or assembly of a new community, the model produced much larger changes in species abundances and much shorter species ages than a neutral model at an equilibrium with fixed community size. In addition, the species abundance distribution was biphasic with a subset of abundant species arising from a founder effect. We confirmed these new results in applications of the new model to the specific scenario of recovery of the Amazon tree community after the endCretaceous bolide impact, which involved periods of increasing and decreasing community size. We conclude that incorporating transient dynamics in neutral models improves realism by allowing explicit consideration of how a community is formed over realistic time-scales.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Large invasive species eradication programs are undertaken to protect native biodiversity and agricul-ture. Programs are typically followed by a series of surveys to assess the likelihood of eradication success and, when residual pests are detected, small-scale control or 'mop-ups' are implemented to eliminate these infestations. Further surveys follow to confirm absence with 'freedom' declared when a target probability of absence is reached. Such biosecurity programs comprise many interacting processes - stochastic biological processes including growth, and response and control interventions - and are an important component of post-border biosecurity. Statistical frameworks formulated to contribute to the design and efficiency of these surveillance and control programs are few and, those available, rely on the simulation of the component processes. In this paper we formulate an analytical Bayesian framework for a general biosecurity program with multiple components to assess pest -eradication success. Our model incorporates stochastic growth and detection processes, and several pest control mechanisms. Survey results and economic considerations are also taken into account to support a range of biosecurity management decisions. Using a case study we demonstrate that solutions match published simulation results and extend the available analysis. Principally, we show how analytical solutions can offer a powerful tool to support the design of effective and cost-efficient biosecurity systems, and we establish some general principles that guide and contribute to robust design.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - We introduce a new model for plant metapopulations with a seed bank component, living in a fragmented environment in which local extinction events are frequent. This model is an intermediate between population dynamics models with a seed bank component, based on the classical Wright- Fisher model, and Stochastic Patch Occupancy Models (SPOMs) used in metapopulation ecology. Its main feature is the use of "ghost " individuals, which can reproduce but with a very strong selective disadvantage against "real " individuals, to artificially ensure a constant population size. We show the existence of an extinction threshold above which persistence of the subpopulation of "real " individuals is not possible, and investigate how the seed bank characteristics affect this extinction threshold. We also show the convergence of the model to a SPOM under an appropriate scaling, bridging the gap between individual-based models and occupancy models. (C)& nbsp;2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Strain competition plays an important role in shaping the dynamics of multiple pathogen outbreaks in a population. Competition may lead to exclusion of some pathogens, while it may influence the invasion of an emerging mutant in the population. However, little emphasis has been given to understand the influence of human vaccination choice on pathogen competition or strain invasion for vaccine-preventable infectious diseases. Coupling game dynamic framework of vaccination choice and compartmental disease transmission model of two strains, we explore invasion and persistence of a mutant in the population despite having a lower reproduction rate than the resident one. We illustrate that higher perceived strain severity and lower perceived vaccine efficacy are necessary conditions for the persistence of a mutant strain. The numerical simulation also extends these invasion and persistence analyses under asymmetric cross-protective immunity of these strains. We show that the dynamics of this cross-immunity model under human vaccination choices is determined by the interplay of parameters defining the cross-immune response function, perceived risk of infection, and vaccine efficacy, and it can exhibit invasion and persistence of mutant strain, even complete exclusion of resident strain in the regime of sufficiently high perceived risk. We conclude by discussing public health implications of the results, that proper risk communication in public about the severity of the disease is an important task to reduce the chance of mutant invasion. Thus, understanding pathogen competitions under social interactions and choices may be an important component for policymakers for strategic decision-making. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - A number of mathematical models have recently been proposed to explain empirical trends of pathogen diversity. In particular, long-term coexistence of both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant variants of a single pathogen is something of a mystery, given that simple models of pathogens competing for the same ecological niche predict competitive exclusion, and more complex models admitting coexistence require assumptions that may not be justified. Coinfection is among the candidate mechanisms to generate coexistence, as it occurs in many pathogens and provides the opportunity for strains to interact directly. Recently, coinfection and competitive release have been described as creating a form of negative frequency-dependent selection that promotes coexistence, and a range of models containing coinfection have been proposed as having generic stable coexistence of multiple strains. This abundance of new models presents the challenge of comparison and interpretation. To this end, we describe a dimensionless quantity that can be used to compare the amount of coexistence generated by different models. We focus on models that include coinfection, although this framework could be generalized to a larger class of structured models. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Host-parasite interactions in the form of infectious diseases are a topic of interest in both evolutionary biology and public health. Both fields have relied on mathematical models to predict and understand the dynamics and consequences of these interactions. Yet few models explicitly incorporate both epidemiological and coevolutionary dynamics, allowing for genetic variation in both hosts and parasites. By comparing a matching-alleles model of coevolution, a susceptible-infected-recovered-susceptible compartmental model from epidemiology, and a combined coevolutionary-epidemiology model we assess the effect of the coevolutionary feedback on the epidemiological dynamics and vice versa. We find that Red-Queen cycles are not robust in an epidemiological framework and that coevolutionary interactions can alter the conditions under which epidemic cycles arise. Incorporating both explicit epidemiology and genetic diversity may have important implications for the maintenance of sexual reproduction as well as disease management. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The analysis of patterns of segregating (i.e. polymorphic) sites in aligned sequences is routine in population genetics. Quantities of interest include the total number of segregating sites and the number of sites with mutations of different frequencies, the so-called site frequency spectrum. For neutrally evolving sequences, some classical results are available, including the expected value and variance of the spectrum in the Kingman coalescent model without recombination as calculated by Fu (1995).
   In this work, we use similar techniques to compute the third moments of the frequencies of three linked sites. Based on these results, we derive analytical results for the bias of Tajima's D and other neutrality tests.
   As a corollary, we obtain the second moments of the frequencies of two linked mutations conditional on the presence of a third mutation with a certain frequency. These moments can be used for the normalisation of new neutrality tests relying on these spectra. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Prolonged exposure to a disturbance such as a toxicant has the potential to result in rapid evolution to toxicant resistance in many short-lived species such as daphniids. This evolution may allow a population to persist at higher levels of the toxicant than is possible without evolution. Here we apply evolutionary game theory to a Leslie matrix model for a daphniid population to obtain a Darwinian model that couples population dynamics with the dynamics of an evolving trait. We use the Darwinian model to consider how the evolution of resistance to the lethal or sublethal effects of a disturbance may change the population dynamics. In particular, we determine the conditions under which a daphniid population can persist by evolving toxicant resistance. We then consider the implications of this evolution in terms of the use of daphniids as surrogate species. We show for three species of daphniids that evolution of toxicant resistance means that one species may persist while another does not. These results suggest that toxicant studies that do not consider the potential of a species (or its surrogate) to develop toxicant resistance may not accurately predict the long term persistence of the species.

AB  - The shape of allele-frequency dines maintained by migration-selection balance depends not only on the properties of migration and selection, but also on the dominance relations among alleles and on linkage to other loci under selection. We investigate a two-locus model in which two diallelic, recombining loci are subject to selection caused by an abrupt environmental change. The habitat is one-dimensional and unbounded, selection at each locus is modeled by step functions such that in one region one allele at each locus is advantageous and in the other deleterious. We admit an environmentally independent, intermediate degree of dominance at both loci, including complete dominance. First, we derive an explicit expression for the single-locus dine with dominance, thus generalizing classical results by Haldane (1948). We show that the slope of the dine in the center (at the step) or, equivalently, the width of the dine, is independent of the degree of dominance. Second, under the assumption of strong recombination relative to selection and migration, the first-order approximations of the allele-frequency dines at each of the loci and of the linkage disequilibrium are derived. This may be interpreted as the quasi-linkage equilibrium approximation of the two-locus dine. Explicit asymptotic expressions for the dines are deduced as x -> +/-infinity. For equivalent loci, explicit expressions for the whole dines are derived. The influence of dominance and of linkage on the slope of the dine in the center and on a global measure of steepness are investigated. This global measure reflects the influence of dominance. Finally, the accuracy of the approximations and the dependence of the shape of the two-locus dine on the full range of recombination rates is explored by numerical integration of the underlying system of partial differential equations.

AB  - Human evolution depends on the co-evolution between genetically determined behaviors and socially transmitted information. Although vertical transmission of cultural information from parent to offspring is common in hominins, its effects on cumulative cultural evolution are not fully understood. Here, we investigate gene-culture co-evolution in a family-structured population by studying the invasion fitness of a mutant allele that influences a deterministic level of cultural information (e.g., amount of knowledge or skill) to which diploid carriers of the mutant are exposed in subsequent generations. We show that the selection gradient on such a mutant, and the concomitant level of cultural information it generates, can be evaluated analytically under the assumption that the cultural dynamic has a single attractor point, thereby making gene-culture co-evolution in family-structured populations with multi generational effects mathematically tractable. We apply our result to study how genetically determined phenotypes of individual and social learning co-evolve with the level of adaptive information they generate under vertical transmission. We find that vertical transmission increases adaptive information due to kin selection effects, but when information is transmitted as efficiently between family members as between unrelated individuals, this increase is moderate in diploids. By contrast, we show that the way resource allocation into learning trades off with allocation into reproduction (the "learning-reproduction trade-off") significantly influences levels of adaptive information. We also show that vertical transmission prevents evolutionary branching and may therefore play a qualitative role in gene-culture co-evolutionary dynamics. More generally, our analysis of selection suggests that vertical transmission can significantly increase levels of adaptive information under the biologically plausible condition that information transmission between relatives is more efficient than between unrelated individuals.

AB  - Principal component analysis (PCA) is widely used in genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and the principal component axes often represent perpendicular gradients in geographic space. The explanation of PCA results is of major interest for geneticists to understand fundamental demographic parameters. Here, we provide an interpretation of PCA based on relatedness measures, which are described by the probability that sets of genes are identical-by-descent (IBD). An approximately linear transformation between ancestral proportions (AP) of individuals with multiple ancestries and their projections onto the principal components is found.
   In addition, a new method of eigenanalysis "EIGMIX" is proposed to estimate individual ancestries. EIGMIX is a method of moments with computational efficiency suitable for millions of SNP data, and it is not subject to the assumption of linkage equilibrium. With the assumptions of multiple ancestries and their surrogate ancestral samples, EIGMIX is able to infer ancestral proportions (APs) of individuals. The methods were applied to the SNP data from the HapMap Phase 3 project and the Human Genome Diversity Panel. The APs of individuals inferred by EIGMIX are consistent with the findings of the program ADMIXTURE.
   In conclusion, EIGMIX can be used to detect population structure and estimate genome-wide ancestral proportions with a relatively high accuracy. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - In a classical study, Wright (1931) proposed a model for the evolution of a biallelic locus under the influence of mutation, directional selection and drift. He derived the equilibrium distribution of the allelic proportion conditional on the scaled mutation rate, the mutation bias and the scaled strength of directional selection. The equilibrium distribution can be used for inference of these parameters with genome-wide datasets of "site frequency spectra" (SFS). Assuming that the scaled mutation rate is low, Wright's model can be approximated by a boundary-mutation model, where mutations are introduced into the population exclusively from sites fixed for the preferred or unpreferred allelic states. With the boundary-mutation model, inference can be partitioned: (i) the shape of the SFS distribution within the polymorphic region is determined by random drift and directional selection, but not by the mutation parameters, such that inference of the selection parameter relies exclusively on the polymorphic sites in the SFS; (ii) the mutation parameters can be inferred from the amount of polymorphic and monomorphic preferred and unpreferred alleles, conditional on the selection parameter. Herein, we derive maximum likelihood estimators for the mutation and selection parameters in equilibrium and apply the method to simulated SFS data as well as empirical data from a Madagascar population of Drosophila simulans.

AB  - Model predictions for species competition outcomes highly depend on the assumed form of the population growth function. In this paper we apply an alternative inferential method based on statistical mechanics, maximizing Boltzmann entropy, to predict resource-constrained population dynamics and coexistence. Within this framework, population dynamics and competition outcome can be determined without assuming any particular form of the population growth function. The dynamics of each species is determined by two parameters: the mean resource requirement theta (related to the mean metabolic rate) and individual distinguishability D-r (related to intra- compared to interspecific functional variation). Our theory clarifies the condition for the energetic equivalence rule (EER) to hold, and provide a statistical explanation for the importance of species functional variation in determining population dynamics and coexistence patterns.

AB  - The reconstruction of a species tree from genomic data faces a double hurdle. First, the (gene) tree describing the evolution of each gene may differ from the species tree, for instance, due to incomplete lineage sorting. Second, the aligned genetic sequences at the leaves of each gene tree provide merely an imperfect estimate of the topology of the gene tree. In this note, we demonstrate formally that a basic statistical problem arises if one tries to avoid accounting for these two processes and analyses the genetic data directly via a concatenation approach. More precisely, we show that, under the multispecies coalescent with a standard site substitution model, maximum likelihood estimation on sequence data that has been concatenated across genes and performed under the incorrect assumption that all sites have evolved independently and identically on a fixed tree is a statistically inconsistent estimator of the species tree. Our results provide a formal justification of simulation results described of Kubatko and Degnan (2007) and others, and complements recent theoretical results by DeGlorgio and Degnan (2010) and Chifman and Kubtako (2014).

AB  - The existence, uniqueness, and shape of dines in a quantitative trait under selection toward a spatially varying optimum is studied. The focus is on deterministic diploid two-locus n-deme models subject to various migration patterns and selection scenarios. Migration patterns may exhibit isolation by distance, as in the stepping-stone model, or random dispersal, as in the island model. The phenotypic optimum may change abruptly in a single environmental step, more gradually, or not at all. Symmetry assumptions are imposed on phenotypic optima and migration rates. We study dines in the mean, variance, and linkage disequilibrium (LD). Clines result from polymorphic equilibria. The possible equilibrium configurations are determined as functions of the migration rate. Whereas for weak migration, many polymorphic equilibria may be simultaneously stable, their number decreases with increasing migration rate. Also for intermediate migration rates polymorphic equilibria are in general not unique, however, for loci of equal effects the corresponding dines in the mean, variance, and LD are unique. For sufficiently strong migration, no polymorphism is maintained. Both migration pattern and selection scenario exert strong influence on the existence and shape of dines. The results for discrete demes are compared with those from models in which space varies continuously and dispersal is modeled by diffusion. Comparisons with previous studies, which investigated dines under neutrality or under linkage equilibrium, are performed. If there is no long-distance migration, the environment does not change abruptly, and linkage is not very tight, populations are almost everywhere close to linkage equilibrium. (C) 2014 The Authors.

AB  - We consider a steady state model of mutual mate choice in which an individual's mate preferences depend on his/her age, and the preferences are over the ages of prospective mates of the opposite sex. We present a discrete time (and age) model corresponding to successive mating seasons. Males are fertile for m periods (corresponding to 'age' i = 1 to m) and females for n <= m periods (they have ages j = 1 to n), which is all that distinguishes the sexes. Although we can deal with arbitrary preferences, we concentrate on a simple fertility model where the common utility to a male age i and female age j who mate is the number K = min(m i - 1, n - j + 1) of future periods of joint fertility. The incoming sex ratio R of age 1 males to age 1 females is given exogenously. In each period individuals are randomly (non assortatively) matched and form a mated couple by mutual consent; otherwise they go into the next period unmated and older. We derive properties of equilibrium threshold acceptance strategies and establish the existence of time-invariant age distributions. Our methods determine the age distribution of couples at marriage (mating) and the population sex ratio (OSR) at equilibrium. Since this can be determined empirically in a population, our model can be used to rule out most systems of age preferences (those not consistent with the observed distribution). This extends earlier models of mutual choice with one dimensional types of Alpern and Reyniers [1999. Strategic mating with homotypic preferences. J. Theor. Biol. 198, 71-88; 2005. Strategic mating with common preferences. J. Theor. Biol. 237,337-354] where individuals sought, respectively, individuals with similar or high types, but in those models an individual's type was fixed over time.
   Under the simple fertility model, at equilibrium the maximum age of an acceptable partner is increasing in the age of the searcher. Our results relate to discussions in the literature regarding optimal parental age differences, age-related mate preferences, and to mate choice in general. We believe our model will be used as a tool in future investigations in these areas. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Biogeography seeks to understand the mechanisms that drive biodiversity across long temporal and large spatial scales. Theoretical models of biogeography can be tested by comparing their predictions of quantities such as species ages against empirical estimates. It has previously been claimed that the neutral theory of biodiversity and biogeography predicts species ages that are unrealistically long. Any improved theory of biodiversity must rectify this problem, but first it is necessary to quantify the problem precisely. Here we provide analytical expressions for species ages in neutral biodiversity communities. We analyse a spatially implicit metacommunity model and solve for both the zero-sum and non-zero-sum cases. We explain why our new expressions are, in the context of biodiversity, usually more appropriate than those previously imported from neutral molecular evolution. Because of the time symmetry of the spatially implicit neutral model, our expressions also lead directly to formulas for species persistence times and species lifetimes. We use our new expressions to estimate species ages of forest trees under a neutral model and find that they are about an order of magnitude shorter than those predicted previously but still unrealistically long. In light of our results, we discuss different models of biogeography that may solve the problem of species ages. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Across many taxa, intriguing positive correlations exist between intelligence (measured by proxy as encephalization), behavioral repertoire size, and lifespan. Here we argue, through a simple theoretical model, that such correlations arise from selection pressures for efficient learning of behavior sequences. We define intelligence operationally as the ability to disregard unrewarding behavior sequences, without trying them out, in the search for rewarding sequences. We show that increasing a species' behavioral repertoire increases the number of rewarding behavior sequences that can be performed, but also the time required to learn such sequences. This trade-off results in an optimal repertoire size that decreases rapidly with increasing sequence length. Behavioral repertoire size can be increased by increasing intelligence or lengthening the lifespan, giving rise to the observed correlations between these traits. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - In recent years, it has become increasingly clear that the evolution of behavior may be better understood as the evolution of the learning mechanisms that produce it, and that such mechanisms should be modeled and tested explicitly. However, this approach, which has recently been applied to animal foraging and decision-making, has rarely been applied to the social and communicative behaviors that are likely to operate in complex social environments and be subject to multi-level selection. Here we use genetic, agent-based evolutionary simulations to explore how learning mechanisms may evolve to adjust the level of nestling begging (offspring signaling of need), and to examine the possible consequences of this process for parent offspring conflict and communication. In doing so, we also provide the first step-by-step dynamic model of parent offspring communication. The results confirm several previous theoretical predictions and demonstrate three novel phenomena. First, negatively frequency-dependent group-level selection can generate a stable polymorphism of learning strategies and parental responses. Second, while conventional reinforcement learning models fail to cope successfully with family dynamics at the nest, a newly developed learning model (incorporating behaviors that are consistent with recent experimental results on learning in nestling begging) produced effective learning, which evolved successfully. Third, while kin-selection affects the frequency of the different learning genes, its impact on begging slope and intensity was unexpectedly negligible, demonstrating that evolution is a complex process, and showing that the effect of kin-selection on behaviors that are shaped by learning may not be predicted by simple application of Hamilton's rule.

AB  - Settlement is a critical transition in the life history of reef fish, and the timing of this event can have a strong effect on fitness. Key factors that influence settlement timing are predictable lunar cyclic variation in tidal currents, moonlight, and nocturnal predation risk as larvae transition from pelagic to benthic environments. However, populations typically display wide variation in the arrival of settlers over the lunar cycle. This variation is often hypothesized to result from unpredictable conditions in the pelagic environment and bet-hedging by spawning adults. Here, we consider the hypothesis that the timing of spawning and settlement is a strategic response to post-settlement competition. We use a game theoretic model to predict spawning and settlement distributions when fish face a tradeoff between minimizing density-independent predation risk while crossing the reef crest vs. avoiding high competitor density on settlement habitat. In general, we expect competition to spread spawning over time such that settlement is distributed around the lunar phase with the lowest predation risk, similar to an ideal free distribution in which competition spreads competitors across space. We examine the effects of overcompensating density dependence, age-dependent competition, and competition among daily settler cohorts. Our model predicts that even in the absence of stochastic variation in the larval environment, competition can result in qualitative divergence between spawning and settlement distributions. Furthermore, we show that if competitive strength increases with settler age, competition results in covariation between settler age and settlement date, with older larvae settling when predation risk is minimal. We predict that competition between daily cohorts delays peak settlement, with priority effects potentially selecting for a multimodal settlement distribution.

AB  - In this paper we study invasion probabilities and invasion times of cooperative parasites spreading in spatially structured host populations. The spatial structure of the host population is given by a random geometric graph on [0,1](n), n is an element of N, with a Poisson(N)-distributed number of vertices and in which vertices are connected over an edge when they have a distance of at most r(N) with r(N) of order N(beta-1)/n for some 0 < beta < 1. At a host infection many parasites are generated and parasites move along edges to neighbouring hosts. We assume that parasites have to cooperate to infect hosts, in the sense that at least two parasites need to attack a host simultaneously. We find lower and upper bounds on the invasion probability of the parasites in terms of survival probabilities of branching processes with cooperation. Furthermore, we characterize the asymptotic invasion time. An important ingredient of the proofs is a comparison with infection dynamics of cooperative parasites in host populations structured according to a complete graph, i.e. in well-mixed host populations. For these infection processes we can show that invasion probabilities are asymptotically equal to survival probabilities of branching processes with cooperation. Furthermore, we build on proof techniques developed in Brouard and Pokalyuk (2022), where an analogous invasion process has been studied for host populations structured according to a configuration model. We substantiate our results with simulations.

AB  - About 50 years ago, Keyfitz (1971) asked how much further a growing human population would increase if its fertility rate were immediately to be reduced to replacement level and remain there forever. The reason for demographic momentum is an age-structure inertia due to relatively many potential parents because of past high fertility. Although nobody expects such a miraculous reduction in reproductive behavior, a gradual decline in fertility in rapidly growing populations seems inevitable. As any delay in fertility decline to a stationary level leads to an increase in the momentum, it makes sense to think about the timing and the quantum of the reduction in reproduction. More specifically, we consider an intertemporal trade-off between costly pro-and anti-natalistic measures and the demographic momentum at the end of the planning period. This paper uses the McKendrick-von Foerster partial differential equation of age-structured population dynamics to study a sketched problem in a distributed parameter control framework. Among the results obtained by applying an appropriate extension of Pontryagin's Maximum Principle are the following: (i) monotony of adaptation efforts to net reproduction rate and convex decrease/concave increase (if initial net reproduction rate exceeds 1/is below 1); and (ii) oscillating efforts and reproduction rate if, additionally, the size of the total population does not deviate from a fixed level.

AB  - We consider the dynamics of a collection of n > 1 populations in which each population has its own rate of growth or decay, fixed in continuous time, and migrants may flow from one population to another over a fixed network, at a rate, fixed over time, times the size of the sending population. This model is represented by an ordinary linear differential equation of dimension n with constant coefficients arrayed in an essentially nonnegative matrix. This paper identifies conditions on the parameters of the model (specifically, conditions on the eigenvalues and eigenvectors) under which the variance of the n population sizes at a given time is asymptotically (as time increases) proportional to a power of the mean of the population sizes at that given time. A power-law variance function is known in ecology as Taylor's Law and in physics as fluctuation scaling. Among other results, we show that Taylor's Law holds asymptotically, with variance asymptotically proportional to the mean squared, on an open dense subset of the class of models considered here.

AB  - Multiple-merger coalescents, also known as A-coalescents, have been used to describe the genealogy of popu lations that have a skewed offspring distribution or that undergo strong selection. Inferring the characteristic measure A, which describes the rates of the multiple-merger events, is key to understand these processes. So far, most inference methods only work for some particular families of A coalescents that are described by only one parameter, but not for more general models. This article is devoted to the construction of a non-parametric estimator of the density of A that is based on the observation at a single time of the so-called Site Frequency Spectrum (SPS), which describes the allelic frequencies in a present population sample. First, we produce estimates of the multiple-merger rates by solving a linear system, whose coefficients are obtained by appropriately subsampling the SFS. Then, we use a technique that aggregates the information extracted from the previous step through a kernel type of re construction to give a non parametric estimation of the measure A. We give a consistency result of this estimator under mild conditions on the behavior of A around 0. We also show some numerical examples of how our method performs,

AB  - The 'isolation with migration' (IM) model has been extensively used in the literature to detect gene flow during the process of speciation. In this model, an ancestral population split into two or more descendant populations which subsequently exchanged migrants at a constant rate until the present. Of course, the assumption of constant gene flow until the present is often over-simplistic in the context of speciation. In this paper, we consider a 'generalised IM' (GIM) model: a two-population IM model in which migration rates and population sizes are allowed to change at some point in the past. By developing a maximum-likelihood implementation of this model, we enable inference on both historical and contemporary rates of gene flow between two closely related populations or species. The GIM model encompasses both the standard two-population IM model and the 'isolation with initial migration' (IIM) model as special cases, as well as a model of secondary contact. We examine for simulated data how our method can be used, by means of likelihood ratio tests or AIC scores, to distinguish between the following scenarios of population divergence: (a) divergence in complete isolation; (b) divergence with a period of gene flow followed by isolation; (c) divergence with a period of isolation followed by secondary contact; (d) divergence with ongoing gene flow. Our method is based on the coalescent and is suitable for data sets consisting of the number of nucleotide differences between one pair of DNA sequences at each of a large number of independent loci. As our method relies on an explicit expression for the likelihood, it is computationally very fast. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - We address the effect of population structure on key properties of the Ewens sampling formula. We use our previously-introduced inductive method for determining exact allele frequency spectrum (AFS) probabilities under the infinite-allele model of mutation and population structure for samples of arbitrary size. Fundamental to the sampling distribution is the novel-allele probability, the probability that given the pattern of variation in the present sample, the next gene sampled belongs to an as-yet-unobserved allelic class. Unlike the case for panmictic populations, the novel-allele probability depends on the AFS of the present sample. We derive a recursion that directly provides the marginal novel-allele probability across AFSs, obviating the need first to determine the probability of each AFS. Our explorations suggest that the marginal novel-allele probability tends to be greater for initial samples comprising fewer alleles and for sampling configurations in which the next-observed gene derives from a deme different from that of the majority of the present sample. Comparison to the efficient importance sampling proposals developed by De Iorio and Griffiths and colleagues indicates that their approximation for the novel-allele probability generally agrees with the true marginal, although it may tend to overestimate the marginal in cases in which the novel-allele probability is high and migration rates are low.

AB  - Because demographic realism complicates analysis, mathematical modelers either ignore demography or make simplifying assumptions (e.g., births and deaths equal). But human populations differ demographically, perhaps most notably in their mortality schedules. We developed an age-stratified population model with births, deaths, aging and mixing between age groups. The model includes types I and II mortality as special cases. We used the gradient approach (Feng et al., 2015, 2017) to explore the impact of mortality patterns on optimal strategies for mitigating vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles and rubella, which the international community has targeted for eradication. Identification of optimal vaccine allocations to reduce the effective reproduction number under various scenarios is presented. Numerical simulations of the model with various types of mortality are carried out to ascertain the long-term effects of vaccination on disease incidence. We conclude that both optimal vaccination strategies and long-term effects of vaccination may depend on demographic assumptions. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Whole genome epistasis models with interactions between different loci can be approximated by genomic relationship models based on Hadamard powers of the additive genomic relationship. We illustrate that the quality of this approximation reduces when the degree of interaction d increases. Moreover, considering relationship models defined as weighted sum of interactions of different degree, we investigate the impact of this decreasing quality of approximation of the summands on the approximation of the weighted sum. Our results indicate that these approximations remain on a reliable level, but their quality reduces when the weights of interactions of higher degrees do not decrease quickly. (C) 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Maladapted individuals can only colonise a new habitat if they can evolve a positive growth rate fast enough to avoid extinction, a process known as evolutionary rescue. We treat log fitness at low density in the new habitat as a single polygenic trait and use the infinitesimal model to follow the evolution of the growth rate; this assumes that the trait values of offspring of a sexual union are normally distributed around the mean of the parents' trait values, with variance that depends only on the parents' relatedness. The probability that a single migrant can establish depends on just two parameters: the mean and genetic variance of the trait in the source population. The chance of success becomes small if migrants come from a population with mean growth rate in the new habitat more than a few standard deviations below zero; this chance depends roughly equally on the probability that the initial founder is unusually fit, and on the subsequent increase in growth rate of its offspring as a result of selection. The loss of genetic variation during the founding event is substantial, but highly variable. With continued migration at rate M, establishment is inevitable; when migration is rare, the expected time to establishment decreases inversely with M. However, above a threshold migration rate, the population may be trapped in a 'sink' state, in which adaptation is held back by gene flow; above this threshold, the expected time to establishment increases exponentially with M. This threshold behaviour is captured by a deterministic approximation, which assumes a Gaussian distribution of the trait in the founder population with mean and variance evolving deterministically. By assuming a constant genetic variance, we also develop a diffusion approximation for the joint distribution of population size and trait mean, which extends to include stabilising selection and density regulation. Divergence of the population from its ancestors causes partial reproductive isolation, which we measure through the reproductive value of migrants into the newly established population.

AB  - We consider a model of viability selection in a highly fecund haploid population with sweepstakes reproduction. We use simulations to estimate the time until the allelic type with highest fitness has reached high frequency in a finite population. We compare the time between two reproduction modes of high and low fecundity. We also consider the probability that the allelic type with highest fitness is lost from the population before reaching high frequency. Our simulation results indicate that highly fecund populations can evolve faster (in some cases much faster) than populations of low fecundity. However, high fecundity and sweepstakes reproduction also confer much higher risk of losing the allelic type with highest fitness from the population by chance. The impact of selection on driving alleles to high frequency varies depending on the trait value conferring highest fitness; in some cases the effect of selection can hardly be detected.

AB  - Identifying the steady states of a population is a key issue in theoretical ecology, that includes the study of spatially heterogeneous populations. There are several examples of real ecosystems in patchy environments where the habitats are heterogeneous in their local density dependence. We investigate a multi-patch model of a single species with spatial dispersal, where the growth of the local population is logistic in some localities (negative density dependence) while other patches exhibit a strong Allee effect (positive density dependence). When the local dynamics is logistic in each patch and the habitats are interconnected by dispersal then the total population has only the extinction steady state and a componentwise positive equilibrium, corresponding to persistence in each patch. We show that animal populations in patchy environments can have a large number of steady states if local density dependence varies over the locations. It is demonstrated that, depending on the network topology of migration routes between the patches, the interaction of spatial dispersal and local density dependence can create a variety of coexisting stable positive equilibria. We give a detailed description of the multiple ways dispersal can rescue local populations from extinction. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - In geographically structured populations, partial global panmixia can be regarded as the limiting case of long-distance migration. In the presence of a geographical barrier, an exact, discrete model for the evolution of the gene frequencies at a multiallelic locus under viability selection, local adult migration, and partial panmixia is formulated. For slow evolution, from this model a spatially unidimensional continuous approximation (a system of integro-partial differential equations with discontinuities at the barrier) is derived. For (i) the step-environment, (ii) homogeneous, isotropic migration on the entire line, and (iii) two alleles without dominance, an explicit solution for the unique polymorphic equilibrium is found. In most natural limiting cases, asymptotic expressions are obtained for the gene frequencies on either side of the barrier. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Although it is likely that many coexistence mechanisms contribute to maintenance of species diversity, most approaches to understanding species coexistence proceed as if only one mechanism would be present. In studies of species coexistence in a temporally fluctuating environment, the storage effect, believed to be the most important coexistence mechanism, has been the focus. Although a different coexistence mechanism-relative nonlinearity-is also predicted to arise frequently with environmental variation, its effect has been overshadowed by the storage effect. The relatively nonlinear growth rates on which the mechanism depends arise simply from differences in life history traits. Many kinds of temporal variation can then interact with these nonlinearity differences to create the relative nonlinearity coexistence mechanism. Much is unknown about when this mechanism is important and its total neglect is not justified. Here, we use the lottery model to provide a much needed quantitative assessment of the relative and combined effects of relative nonlinearity and the storage effect. Our analysis takes advantage of recently developed techniques for quantifying coexistence mechanisms when multiple mechanisms operate in concert. We find that relative nonlinearity is able to contribute substantially to species coexistence in the lottery model when two conditions are satisfied: (1) species must differ greatly in their adult death rates, (2) sensitivity of recruitment to environmental variation must be greater for species with larger adult death rates. In addition, relative nonlinearity has a critical role in compensating for a weakened storage effect when there is high correlation between species in their responses to the varying environment. In some circumstances relative nonlinearity is stronger than the storage effect or is even the sole mechanism of coexistence. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Tuberculosis (TB) is a leading cause of human mortality due to infectious disease. Treatment default is a relevant factor which reduces therapeutic success and increases the risk of resistant TB. In this work we analyze the relation between treatment default and treatment length along with its consequence on the disease spreading. We use a stylized model structure to explore, systematically, the effects of varying treatment duration and compliance. We find that shortening treatment alone may not reduce TB prevalence, especially in regions where transmission intensity is high, indicating the necessity of complementing this action with increased compliance. A family of default functions relating the proportion of defaulters to the treatment length is considered and adjusted to a particular dataset. We find that the epidemiological benefits of shorter treatment regimens are tightly associated with increases in treatment compliance and depend on the epidemiological background.

AB  - Soft selective sweeps represent an important form of adaptation in which multiple haplotypes bearing adaptive alleles rise to high frequency. Most statistical methods for detecting selective sweeps from genetic polymorphism data, however, have focused on identifying hard selective sweeps in which a favored allele appears on a single haplotypic background; these methods might be underpowered to detect soft sweeps. Among exceptions is the set of haplotype homozygosity statistics introduced for the detection of soft sweeps by Garud et al. (2015). These statistics, examining frequencies of multiple haplotypes in relation to each other, include H-12, a statistic designed to identify both hard and soft selective sweeps, and H-2/H-1, a statistic that conditional on high H-12 values seeks to distinguish between hard and soft sweeps. A challenge in the use of H-2/H-1 is that its range depends on the associated value of H-12, so that equal H-2/H-1 values might provide different levels of support for a soft sweep model at different values of H-12. Here, we enhance the H-12 and H-2/H-1 haplotype homozygosity statistics for selective sweep detection by deriving the upper bound on H-2/H-1 as a function of H-12, thereby generating a statistic that normalizes H-2/H-1 to lie between 0 and 1. Through a reanalysis of resequencing data from inbred lines of Drosophila, we show that the enhanced statistic both strengthens interpretations obtained with the unnormalized statistic and leads to empirical insights that are less readily apparent without the normalization.

AB  - The differences between DNA-sequences within a population are the basis to infer the ancestral relationship of the individuals. Within the classical infinitely many sites model, it is possible to estimate the mutation rate based on the site frequency spectrum, which is comprised by the numbers C-1,...,Cn-1 where n is the sample size and C-s is the number of site mutations (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms, SNPs) which are seen in s genomes. Classical results can be used to compare the observed site frequency spectrum with its neutral expectation, E[C-s] = theta(2)/s, where theta(2) is the scaled site mutation rate. In this paper, we will relax the assumption of the infinitely many sites model that all individuals only carry homologous genetic material. Especially, it is today well-known that bacterial genomes have the ability to gain and lose genes, such that every single genome is a mosaic of genes, and genes are present and absent in a random fashion, giving rise to the dispensable genome. While this presence and absence has been modeled under neutral evolution within the infinitely many genes model in Baumdicker et al. (2010), we link presence and absence of genes with the numbers of site mutations seen within each gene. In this work we derive a formula for the expectation of the joint gene and site frequency spectrum, denoted by G(k,s), the number of mutated sites occurring in exactly s gene sequences, while the corresponding gene is present in exactly k individuals. We show that standard estimators of theta(2) for dispensable genes are biased and that the site frequency spectrum for dispensable genes differs from the classical result. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - For a one- or two-dimensional lattice of finite length consisting of populations, each of which has the same population size, the classical stepping-stone model has been used to approximate the patterns of variation at neutral loci in geographic regions. In the pioneering papers by Maruyama (1970a, 1970b, 1971) the changes of gene frequency at a locus subject to neutral mutation between two alleles, migration, and random genetic drift were modeled by a vector autoregression model. Maruyama was able to use the spectrum of the migration matrix, but to do this he had to introduce approximations in which there was either extra mutation in the terminal populations, or extra migration from the subterminal population into the terminal population. In this paper a similar vector autoregression model is used, but it proves possible to obtain the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the migration matrix without those approximations. Approximate formulas for the variances and covariances of gene frequencies in different populations are obtained, and checked by numerical iteration of the exact covariances of the vector autoregression model.

AB  - The coalescent with recombination process has initially been formulated backwards in time, but simulation algorithms and inference procedures often apply along sequences. Therefore it is of major interest to approximate the coalescent with recombination process by a Markov chain along sequences. We consider the finite loci case and two or more sequences. We formulate a natural Markovian approximation for the tree building process along the sequences, and derive simple and analytically tractable formulae for the distribution of the tree at the next locus conditioned on the tree at the present locus. We compare our Markov approximation to other sequential Markov chains and discuss various applications. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Phenotypic adaptation to fluctuating environments has been an important focus in the population genetic literature. Previous studies have shown that evolution under temporal variation is determined not only by expected fitness in a given generation, but also by the degree of variation in fitness over generations; in an uncertain environment, alleles that increase the geometric mean fitness can invade a randomly mating population at equilibrium. This geometric mean principle governs the evolutionary interplay of genes controlling mean phenotype and genes controlling phenotypic variation, such as genetic regulators of the epigenetic machinery. Thus, it establishes an important role for stochastic epigenetic variation in adaptation to fluctuating environments: by modifying the geometric mean fitness, variance-modifying genes can change the course of evolution and determine the long-term trajectory of the evolving system. The role of phenotypic variance has previously been studied in systems in which the only driving force is natural selection, and there is no recombination between mean- and variance-modifying genes. Here, we develop a population genetic model to investigate the effect of recombination between mean- and variance-modifiers of phenotype on the geometric mean principle under different environmental regimes and fitness landscapes. We show that interactions of recombination with stochastic epigenetic variation and environmental fluctuations can give rise to complex evolutionary dynamics that differ from those in systems with no recombination.

AB  - This work examines both positive and negative impacts that economic growth may have on the ecological dynamics and stability of a single biological species. Local extinction of the species may force the social planner to implement defensive expenditures aimed at conservation of the species population by means of habitat protection. The latter may lead to an ecological equilibrium that will be different from the natural equilibrium that would have arisen in the absence of human intervention. Moreover, the existence of such equilibrium is formally demonstrated and its stability properties are revised. Additionally, optimal-choice decision policies are constructed on the basis of Pontryagin's maximum principle. Under such policies together with initial abundance of the species, the growth trajectories will move the system towards the fixed point of maximum species abundance. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Recombination often concentrates in small regions called recombination hotspots where recombination is much higher than the genome's average. In many vertebrates, including humans, gene PRDM9 specifies which DNA motifs will be the target for breaks that initiate recombination, ultimately determining the location of recombination hotspots. Because the sequence that breaks (allowing recombination) is converted into the sequence that does not break (preventing recombination), the latter sequence is over-transmitted to future generations and recombination hotspots are selfdestructive. Given their self-destructive nature, recombination hotspots should eventually become extinct in genomes where they are found. While empirical evidence shows that individual hotspots do become inactive over time (die), hotspots are abundant in many vertebrates: a contradiction called the Recombination Hotspot Paradox. What saves recombination hotspots from their foretold extinction? Here we formulate a co-evolutionary model of the interaction among sequence-specific gene conversion, fertility selection, and recurrent mutation. We find that allelic frequencies oscillate leading to stable limit cycles. From a biological perspective this means that when fertility selection is weaker than gene conversion, it cannot stop individual hotspots from dying but can save them from extinction by driving their re-activation (resuscitation). In our model, mutation balances death and resuscitation of hotspots, thus maintaining their number over evolutionary time. Interestingly, we find that multiple alleles result in oscillations that are chaotic and multiple targets in oscillations that are asynchronous between targets thus helping to maintain the average genomic recombination probability constant. Furthermore, we find that the level of expression of PRDM9 should control for the fraction of targets that are hotspots and the overall temperature of the genome. Therefore, our coevolutionary model improves our understanding of how hotspots may be replaced, thus contributing to solve the Recombination Hotspot Paradox. From a more applied perspective our work provides testable predictions regarding the relation between mutation probability and fertility selection with life expectancy of hotspots. & COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - Chan, Durrett, and Lanchier introduced a multitype contact process with temporal heterogeneity involving two species competing for space on the d-dimensional integer lattice. Time is divided into two seasons. They proved that there is an open set of the parameters for which both species can coexist when their dispersal range is sufficiently large. Numerical simulations suggested that three species can coexist in the presence of two seasons. The main point of this paper is to prove that this conjecture is incorrect. To do this we prove results for a more general ODE model and contrast its behavior with other related systems that have been studied in order to understand the competitive exclusion principle.

AB  - A number of powerful demographic inference methods have been developed in recent years, with the goal of fitting rich evolutionary models to genetic data obtained from many populations. In this paper we investigate the statistical performance of these methods in the specific case where there is continuous migration between populations. Compared with earlier work, migration significantly complicates the theoretical analysis and requires new techniques. We employ the theories of phase-type distributions and concentration of measure in order to study the two-island and isolation-withmigration models, resulting in both upper and lower bounds on rates of convergence for parametric estimators in migration models. For the upper bounds, we consider inferring rates of coalescent and migration on the basis of directly observing pairwise coalescent times, and, more realistically, when (conditionally) Poisson-distributed mutations dropped on latent trees are observed. We complement these upper bounds with information-theoretic lower bounds which establish a limit, in terms of sample size, below which inference is effectively impossible.

AB  - The site frequency spectrum (SFS) is an important statistic that summarizes the molecular variation in a population, and is used to estimate population-genetic parameters and detect natural selection. Here, we study the SFS in a randomly mating, diploid population in which both the population size and selection coefficient vary periodically with time using a diffusion theory approach, and derive simple analytical expressions for the time-averaged SFS in slowly and rapidly changing environments. We show that for strong selection and in slowly changing environments where the population experiences both positive and negative cycles of the selection coefficient, the time-averaged SFS differs significantly from the equilibrium SFS in a constant environment. The deviation is found to depend on the time spent by the population in the deleterious part of the selection cycle and the phase difference between the selection coefficient and population size, and can be captured by an effective population size.

AB  - How long a newly emerging trait will stay in a population is a fundamental but rarely asked question in cultural evolution. To tackle this question, the distribution and mean of the time to extinction of a discrete cultural trait are derived for models with overlapping generations, in which trait transmission occurs from multiple role models to a single newborn and may fail with a certain probability. We explore two models. The first is a Moran-type model, which allows us to derive the exact analytical formula for the mean time to extinction of a trait in a finite population. The second is a branching process, which assumes an infinitely large population and allows us to derive approximate analytical formulae for the distribution and mean of the time to extinction in the first model under a large population size. We show that in the first model, the mean time to extinction apparently diverges (becomes so large that even numerical computation is impractical) under a certain parameter condition as the population size tends to infinity. Using the second model, we explain the underlying mechanism of the apparent divergence found in the first model and derive the mathematical condition for this divergence in terms of transmission efficiency and the number of role models per newborn. When this mathematical condition is satisfied in the second model, the probability of extinction is less than 1, and the mean extinction time does not exist. In addition, we find that in both models, the time to extinction of the trait becomes longer as the number of role models per individual increases and as cultural transmission becomes more efficient.

AB  - Most natural environments vary stochastically and are temporally autocorrelated. Previous theory investigating the effects of environmental autocorrelation on evolution mostly assumed that total fitness resulted from a single selection episode. Yet organisms are likely to experience selection repeatedly along their life, in response to possibly different environmental states. We model the evolution of a quantitative trait in organisms with non-overlapping generations undergoing several episodes of selection in a randomly fluctuating and autocorrelated environment. We show that the evolutionary dynamics depends not directly on fluctuations of the environment, but instead on those of an effective phenotypic optimum that integrates the effects of all selection episodes within each generation. The variance and autocorrelation of the integrated optimum shape the variance and predictability of selection, with substantial qualitative and quantitative deviations from previous predictions considering a single selection episode per generation. We also investigate the consequence of multiple selection episodes per generation on population load. In particular, we identify a new load resulting from within-generation fluctuating selection, generating the death of individuals without significance for the evolutionary dynamics. Our study emphasizes how taking into account fluctuating selection within lifetime unravels new properties of evolutionary dynamics, with crucial implications notably with respect to responses to global changes.

AB  - Only 6% of known species have a conservation status. Methods that assess conservation statuses are often based on individual counts and are thus too laborious to be generalized to all species. Population genomics methods that infer past variations in population size are easy to use but limited to the relatively distant past. Here we propose a population genomics approach that tests for recent population decline and may be used to assess species conservation statuses. More specifically, we study Maximal Recombination Free (MRF) blocks, that are segments of a sequence alignment inherited from a common ancestor without recombination. MRF blocks are relatively longer in small than in large populations. We use the distribution of MRF block lengths rescaled by their mean to test for recent population decline. However, because MRF blocks are difficult to detect, we also consider Maximal Linkage Disequilibrium (MLD) blocks, which are runs of single nucleotide polymorphisms compatible with a single tree. We develop a new method capable of inferring a very recent decline (e.g. with a detection power of 50% for populations whose size was halved to N, 0.05 xN generations ago) from rescaled MLD block lengths. Our framework could serve as a basis for quantitative tools to assess conservation status in a wide range of species. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - We revisit the classical, and introduce a novel, concept of two-locus linkage disequilibrium (LD). In contrast to defining haplotypes as allele combinations at two marker loci, we concentrate on the clustering of a sample of chromosomes induced by their coalescent genealogy. The root of a binary coalescent tree defines two clusters of chromosomes, each one of them containing the left and right descendants of the root. At two different loci this assignment may be different as a result of recombination. We show that the proportion of shared chromosomes among clusters at two different loci, measured by the squared correlation, constitutes a natural measure of LD. We call this topological LD (tLD) since it is induced by the topology of the coalescent tree. We find that it is, on average, larger than classical LD for any given distance between loci. Furthermore, tLD has a smaller coefficient of variation, which should provide an advantage, compared to the use of classical LD, for any kind of mapping purposes. We conclude with a practical application to the LCT region in human populations. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Through the lens of game theory, cooperation is frequently considered an unsustainable strategy: if an entire population is cooperating, each individual can increase its overall fitness by choosing not to cooperate, thereby still receiving all the benefit of its cooperating neighbors while no longer expending its own energy. Observable cooperation in naturally-occurring public goods games is consequently of great interest, as such systems offer insight into both the emergence and sustainability of cooperation. Here we consider a population that obeys a public goods game on a network of discrete regions (that we call colonies), between any two of which individuals are free to migrate. We construct a system of piecewise-smooth ordinary differential equations that couple the within-colony population dynamics and the between-colony migratory dynamics. Through a combination of analytical and numerical methods, we show that if the workers within the population migrate sufficiently fast relative to the cheaters, the network loses stability first through a Hopf bifurcation, then a torus bifurcation, after which one or more colonies collapse. Our results indicate that fast moving cheaters can act to stabilize worker-cheater coexistence within network that would otherwise collapse. We end with a comparison of our results with the dynamics observed in colonies of the ant species Pristomyrmex punctatus, and argue that they qualitatively agree. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Spirochetes belonging to the Borrelia burgdoferi sensu lato (sl) group cause Lyme Borreliosis (LB), which is the most commonly reported vector-borne zoonosis in Europe. B. burgdorferi sl is maintained in nature in a complex cycle involving Ixodes ricinus ticks and several species of vertebrate hosts. The transmission dynamics of B. burgdorferi sl is complicated by the varying competence of animals for different genospecies of spirochetes that, in turn, vary in their capability of causing disease. In this study, a set of difference equations simplifying the complex interaction between vectors and their hosts (competent and not for Borrelia) is built to gain insights into conditions underlying the dominance of B. lusitaniae (transmitted by lizards to susceptible ticks) and the maintenance of B. afzelii (transmitted by wild rodents) observed in a study area in Tuscany, Italy. Findings, in agreement with field observations, highlight the existence of a threshold for the fraction of larvae feeding on rodents below which the persistence of B. afzelii is not possible. Furthermore, thresholds change as nonlinear functions of the expected number of nymph bites on mice, and the transmission and recovery probabilities. In conclusion, our model provided an insight into mechanisms underlying the relative frequency of different Borrelia genospecies, as observed in field studies. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - After a disturbance event, population recovery becomes an important species response that drives ecosystem dynamics. Yet, it is unclear how interspecific interactions impact species recovery from a disturbance and which role the disturbance duration (pulse or press) plays. Here, we analytically derive conditions that govern the transient recovery dynamics from disturbance of a host and its obligately dependent partner in a two-species metapopulation model. We find that, after disturbance, species recovery dynamics depend on the species' role (i.e. host or obligately dependent species) as well as the duration of disturbance. Host recovery starts immediately after the disturbance. In contrast, for obligate species, recovery depends on disturbance duration. After press disturbance, which allows dynamics to equilibrate during disturbance, obligate species immediately start to recover. Yet, after pulse disturbance, obligate species continue declining although their hosts have already begun to increase. Effectively, obligate species recovery is delayed until a necessary host threshold occupancy is reached. Obligates' delayed recovery arises solely from interspecific interactions independent of dispersal limitations, which contests previous explanations. Delayed recovery exerts a two-fold negative effect, because populations continue declining to even smaller population sizes and the phase of increased risk from demographic stochastic extinction in small populations is prolonged. We argue that delayed recovery and its determinants species interactions and disturbance duration - have to be considered in biodiversity management.(C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - We study several epidemic models (with and without gender structure) that incorporate risk compensation behavior in response to a lower chance of acquiring the infection as a result of preventive measures that are only partially effective. We show that the cumulative risk compensation that occurs between a high risk susceptible and infectious individual may play an important role in whether the implementation of these measures is successful in lowering the epidemic reproductive number. In addition, we show that certain levels of risk compensation may cancel the benefit of the low infection risk practiced by diagnosed infectious individuals when the goal is a reduction of the epidemic reproductive number.

AB  - In population genetic studies, the allele frequency spectrum (AFS) efficiently summarizes genomewide polymorphism data and shapes a variety of allele frequency-based summary statistics. While existing theory typically features equilibrium conditions, emerging methodology requires an analytical understanding of the build-up of the allele frequencies over time. In this work, we use the framework of Poisson random fields to derive new representations of the non-equilibrium AFS for the case of a Wright-Fisher population model with selection. In our approach, the AFS is a scaling-limit of the expectation of a Poisson stochastic integral and the representation of the non-equilibrium AFS arises in terms of a fixation time probability distribution. The known duality between the Wright-Fisher diffusion process and a birth and death process generalizing Kingman's coalescent yields an additional representation. The results carry over to the setting of a random sample drawn from the population and provide the non-equilibrium behavior of sample statistics. Our findings are consistent with and extend a previous approach where the non-equilibrium AFS solves a partial differential forward equation with a non-traditional boundary condition. Moreover, we provide a bridge to previous coalescent-based work, and hence tie several frameworks together. Since frequency-based summary statistics are widely used in population genetics, for example, to identify candidate loci of adaptive evolution, to infer the demographic history of a population, or to improve our understanding of the underlying mechanics of speciation events, the presented results are potentially useful for a broad range of topics.

AB  - Questions surrounding the prevalence of complex population dynamics form one of the central themes in ecology. Limit cycles and spatiotemporal chaos are examples that have been widely recognised theoretically, although their importance and applicability to natural populations remains debatable. The ecological processes underlying such dynamics are thought to be numerous, though there seems to be consent as to delayed density dependence being one of the main driving forces. Indeed, time delay is a common feature of many ecological systems and can significantly influence population dynamics. In general, time delays may arise from inter- and intra-specific trophic interactions or population structure, however in the context of single species populations they are linked to more intrinsic biological phenomena such as gestation or resource regeneration. In this paper, we consider theoretically the spatiotemporal dynamics of a single species population using two different mathematical formulations. Firstly, we revisit the diffusive logistic equation in which the per capita growth is a function of some specified delayed argument. We then modify the model by incorporating a spatial convolution which results in a biologically more viable integro-differential model. Using the combination of analytical and numerical techniques, we investigate the effect of time delay on pattern formation. In particular, we show that for sufficiently large values of time delay the system's dynamics are indicative to spatiotemporal chaos. The chaotic dynamics arising in the wake of a travelling population front can be preceded by either a plateau corresponding to dynamical stabilisation of the unstable equilibrium or by periodic oscillations.

AB  - Increasing the colonization rate of metapopulations can improve persistence, but can also increase exposure to threats. To make good decisions, managers must understand whether increased colonization is beneficial or detrimental to metapopulation persistence. While a number of studies have examined interactions between metapopulations, colonization, and threats, they have assumed that threat dynamics respond linearly to changes in colonization. Here, we determined when to increase colonization while explicitly accounting for non-linear dependencies between a metapopulation and its threats. We developed patch occupancy metapopulation models for species susceptible to abiotic, generalist, and specialist threats and modeled the total derivative of the equilibrium proportion of patches occupied by each metapopulation with respect to the colonization rate. By using the total derivative, we developed a rule for determining when to increase metapopulation colonization. This rule was applied to a simulated metapopulation where the dynamics of each threat responded to increased colonization following a power function. Before modifying colonization, we show that managers must understand: (1) whether a metapopulation is susceptible to a threat; (2) the type of threat acting on a metapopulation; (3) which component of threat dynamics might depend on colonization, and; (4) the likely response of a threat dependent variable to changes in colonization. The sensitivity of management decisions to these interactions increases uncertainty in conservation planning decisions. Crown Copyright (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Ancestral processes are fundamental to modern population genetics and spatial structure has been the subject of intense interest for many years. Despite this interest, almost nothing is known about the distribution of the locations of pedigree or genetic ancestors. Using both spatially continuous and stepping-stone models, we show that the distribution of pedigree ancestors approaches a travelling wave, for which we develop two alternative approximations. The speed and width of the wave are sensitive to the local details of the model. After a short time, genetic ancestors spread far more slowly than pedigree ancestors, ultimately diffusing out with radius similar to root t rather than spreading at constant speed. In contrast to the wave of pedigree ancestors, the spread of genetic ancestry is insensitive to the local details of the models. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Simple and ubiquitous gene interactions create rugged fitness landscapes composed of coadapted gene complexes separated by "valleys" of low fitness. Crossing such fitness valleys allows a population to escape suboptimal local fitness peaks to become better adapted. This is the premise of Sewall Wright's shifting balance process. Here we generalize the theory of fitness-valley crossing in the two-locus, bi- allelic case by allowing bias in parent-offspring transmission. This generalization extends the existing mathematical framework to genetic systems with segregation distortion and uniparental inheritance. Our results are also flexible enough to provide insight into shifts between alternate stable states in cultural systems with "transmission valleys". Using a semi-deterministic analysis and a stochastic diffusion approximation, we focus on the limiting step in valley crossing: the first appearance of the genotype on the new fitness peak whose lineage will eventually fix. We then apply our results to specific cases of segregation distortion, uniparental inheritance, and cultural transmission. Segregation distortion favouring mutant alleles facilitates crossing most when recombination and mutation are rare, i.e., scenarios where crossing is otherwise unlikely. Interactions with more mutable genes (e.g., uniparental inherited cytoplasmic elements) substantially reduce crossing times. Despite component traits being passed on poorly in the previous cultural background, small advantages in the transmission of a new combination of cultural traits can greatly facilitate a cultural transition. While peak shifts are unlikely under many of the common assumptions of population genetic theory, relaxing some of these assumptions can promote fitness-valley crossing. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The consequences of spatially varying, stabilizing or directional selection on a quantitative trait in a subdivided population are studied. A deterministic two-locus two-deme model is employed to explore the effects of migration, the degree of divergent selection, and the genetic architecture, i.e., the recombination rate and ratio of locus effects, on the maintenance of genetic variation. The possible equilibrium configurations are determined as functions of the migration rate. They depend crucially on the strength of divergent selection and the genetic architecture. The maximum migration rates are investigated below which a stable fully polymorphic equilibrium or a stable single-locus polymorphism can exist. Under stabilizing selection, but with different optima in the demes, strong recombination may facilitate the maintenance of polymorphism. However usually, and in particular with directional selection in opposite direction, the critical migration rates are maximized by a concentrated genetic architecture, i.e., by a major locus and a tightly linked minor one. Thus, complementing previous work on the evolution of genetic architectures in subdivided populations subject to diversifying selection, it is shown that concentrated architectures may aid the maintenance of polymorphism. Conditions are obtained when this is the case. Finally, the dependence of the phenotypic variance, linkage disequilibrium, and various measures of local adaptation and differentiation on the parameters is elaborated. (C) 2014 The Authors.

AB  - The methods of Maximum Entropy have been deployed for some years to address the problem of species abundance distributions. In this approach, it is important to identify the correct weighting factors, or priors, to be applied before maximising the entropy function subject to constraints. The forms of such priors depend not only on the exact problem but can also depend on the way it is set up; priors are determined by the underlying dynamics of the complex system under consideration. The problem is one of statistical mechanics and it is the properties of the system that yield the correct MaxEnt priors, appropriate to the way the problem is framed. Here I calculate, in several different ways, the species abundance distribution resulting when individuals in a community are born and die independently. In the usual formulation the prior distribution for the number of species over the number of individuals is 1/n; the problem can be reformulated in terms of the distribution of individuals over species classes, with a uniform prior. Results are obtained using master equations for the dynamics and separately through the combinatoric methods of elementary statistical mechanics; the MaxEnt priors then emerge a posteriori. The first object is to establish the log series species abundance distribution as the outcome of per capita guild dynamics. The second is to clarify the true nature and origin of priors in the language of MaxEnt. Finally, I consider how it may come about that the distribution is similar to log series in the event that Filled niches dominate species abundance. For the general ecologist, there are two messages. First, that species abundance distributions are determined largely by population sorting through fractional processes (resulting in the 1/n factor) and secondly that useful information is likely to be found only in departures from the log series. For the MaxEnt practitioner, the message is that the prior with respect to which the entropy is to be maximised is determined by the nature of the problem and the way in which it is formulated.

AB  - Source-sink systems are metapopulations of patches with different, and possibly temporally varying, habitat qualities, which are commonly used in ecology to study the fate of spatially extended populations.
   We propose new techniques that disentangle the respective contributions of demography and dispersal to the dynamics and fate of a single species in a source-sink system. Our approach is valid for a general class of stochastic, individual-based, stepping-stone models, with density-independent demography and dispersal, provided that the metapopulation is finite or else enjoys some transitivity property.
   We provide (1) a simple criterion of persistence, by studying the motion of a single random disperser until it returns to its initial position; (2) a joint characterization of the long-term growth rate and of the asymptotic occupancy frequencies of the ancestral lineage of a random survivor, by using large deviations theory. Both techniques yield formulas decoupling demography and dispersal, and can be adapted to the case of periodic or random environments, where habitat qualities are autocorrelated in space and possibly in time.
   In this last case, we display examples of coupled time-averaged sinks allowing survival, as was previously known in the absence of demographic stochasticity for fully mixing (Jansen and Yoshimura, 1998) or partially mixing (Evans et al., 2012; Schreiber, 2010) metapopulations.

AB  - Human populations vary demographically with population sizes ranging from small groups of hunter-gatherers with less than fifty individuals to vast cities containing many millions. Here we investigate how the cultural transmission of traits affecting survival, fertility, or both can influence the birth rate, age structure, and asymptotic growth rate of a population. We show that the strong spread of such a trait can lead to a demographic transition, similar to that experienced in Europe in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, without using ecological or economic optimizing models. We also show that the spread of a cultural trait that increases fertility, but not survival, can cause demographic change similar to the 'Neolithic demographic transition': a period of increased population growth that is thought to have accompanied the transition from hunter-gatherer to agricultural lifestyles. We investigate the roles of vertical, oblique, and horizontal learning of such a trait in this transition and find that compared to vertical learning alone, horizontal and oblique learning can accelerate the trait's spread, lead to faster population growth, and increase its equilibrium frequency.

AB  - We outline two approaches to inference of neighbourhood size, X, and dispersal rate, sigma(2), based on either allele frequencies or on the lengths of sequence blocks that are shared between genomes. Over intermediate timescales (10-100 generations, say), populations that live in two dimensions approach a quasi-equilibrium that is independent of both their local structure and their deeper history. Over such scales, the standardised covariance of allele frequencies (i.e. pairwise F-ST) falls with the logarithm of distance, and depends only on neighbourhood size, N , and a 'local scale', kappa; the rate of gene flow, sigma(2), cannot be inferred. We show how spatial correlations can be accounted for, assuming a Gaussian distribution of allele frequencies, giving maximum likelihood estimates of N and kappa. Alternatively, inferences can be based on the distribution of the lengths of sequence that are identical between blocks of genomes: long blocks (>0.1 cM, say) tell us about intermediate timescales, over which we assume a quasi-equilibrium. For large neighbourhood size, the distribution of long blocks is given directly by the classical Wright-Malecot formula; this relationship can be used to infer both N and sigma(2). With small neighbourhood size, there is an appreciable chance that recombinant lineages will coalesce back before escaping into the distant past. For this case, we show that if genomes are sampled from some distance apart, then the distribution of lengths of blocks that are identical in state is geometric, with a mean that depends on N and sigma(2).

AB  - The genealogical consequences of temporally fluctuating selection at linked neutrally-evolving sites are studied using coalescent processes structured by genetic backgrounds. Surprisingly, although between-generation fluctuating selection and within-generation fecundity variance polymorphism lead to indistinguishable allele frequency dynamics at the selected site, I show that these two scenarios affect the genealogical structure of the population in distinctive ways. Whereas coalescence times are elevated at the selected site when heterozygotes have lower within-generation fecundity variance than either homozygote, fluctuating selection typically depresses the depth of the genealogy at tightly-linked sites. More importantly, these results indicate that fluctuating selection will have a characteristic signature combining an excess of selected variation at the affected site and a slight reduction in neutral variation at tightly linked sites. This observation suggests that it may be possible to distinguish balanced polymorphisms maintained by environmental variation from those maintained by heterozygote advantage. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The rich theory of infectious disease modelling using the Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) framework is mainly based on the assumption of a well-mixed population, under which evolutionary behaviours (typically derived using adaptive dynamics) are shown to depend critically on the qualitative features of a virulence-transmission trade-off. Spatial extensions of this work, using simulation studies, show multiple evolutionary outcomes, which strongly depend on trade-off shape and, additionally, the length scale of the infectious process. In this paper, we aim to shed analytical insight into the mechanisms underlying these spatial evolutionary outcomes. In particular, why there is a qualitative difference observed in the evolutionary predicted virulence rates between linear and decelerating trade-offs between transmission and virulence and how recovery can weaken the effect of space. We use both pair approximations and cellular automata to model the spatial populations and the analysis exploits small neighbourhood variations in the spatial settings. The evolutionary outcomes are derived using adaptive dynamics. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Plankton patchiness in homogeneous physical environments is studied in this paper assuming that all involved populations disperse diffusively. A recent but powerful sufficient condition for the emergence of spatial patterns in models with any number of species is systematically applied to all food chain and food web plankton models and the result is rather sharp: all models explicitly containing phytoplankton, zooplankton and planktivorous fish suggest zooplankton patchiness, while models not containing phytoplankton or fish populations do not. The results are in agreement with many previous but particular theoretical studies on plankton patchiness and Turing instability, and a testable prediction of the models satisfying the sufficient predictions is that zooplankton should be more patchy than phytoplankton, a property that is often seen in natural settings. An application to a complex model with five compartments (nutrient, phytoplankton, zooplankton, planktivorous fish, carnivorous fish) highlights the predictive power of the method.

AB  - Humans have created highly developed cultures, brought about by iterative improvements in technology. Using a mathematical model, I investigated the conditions under which cultural traits tend to be improved for a higher level of culture to evolve. In the model, I consider three ways of learning: individual learning, simple social learning, and improvements of socially learned cultural traits (social improvement). I obtain the evolutionarily stable number of cultural traits acquired through each way of learning. I show that organisms improve many socially learned cultural traits under the following conditions: (1) environmental stability is intermediate; (2) the environment is severe; (3) the success rate of individual learning is high; (4) the utility of cultural traits acquired by individual learning is large; (5) the accuracy of social learning is high; and (6) the increase in the utility of beneficial cultural traits attained by social improvement is large. I also show that when organisms have greater ability for social improvement, the average utility of the beneficial cultural trait increases, the proportion of beneficial cultural traits among all cultural traits decreases, and the total number of cultural traits acquired by the three ways of learning is constant. These results shed light on the origins of human cumulative culture. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Understanding the conditions that promote the evolution of migration is important in ecology and evolution. When environments are fixed and there is one most favorable site, migration to other sites lowers overall growth rate and is not favored. Here we ask, can environmental variability favor migration when there is one best site on average? Previous work suggests that the answer is yes, but a general and precise answer remained elusive. Here we establish new, rigorous inequalities to show (and use simulations to illustrate) how stochastic growth rate can increase with migration when fitness (dis)advantages fluctuate over time across sites. The effect of migration between sites on the overall stochastic growth rate depends on the difference in expected growth rates and the variance of the fluctuating difference in growth rates. When fluctuations (variance) are large, a population can benefit from bursts of higher growth in sites that are worse on average. Such bursts become more probable as the between-site variance increases. Our results apply to many ( >= 2) sites, and reveal an interplay between the length of paths between sites, the average differences in site-specific growth rates, and the size of fluctuations. Our findings have implications for evolutionary biology as they provide conditions for departure from the reduction principle, and for ecological dynamics: even when there are superior sites in a sea of poor habitats, variability and habitat quality across space determine the importance of migration.

AB  - By quantifying key life history parameters in populations, such as growth rate, longevity, and generation time, researchers and administrators can obtain valuable insights into its dynamics. Although point estimates of demographic parameters have been available since the inception of demography as a scientific discipline, the construction of confidence intervals has typically relied on approximations through series expansions or computationally intensive techniques. This study introduces the first mathematical expression for calculating confidence intervals for the aforementioned life history traits when individuals are unidentifiable and data are presented as a life table. The key finding is the accurate estimation of the confidence interval for r, the instantaneous growth rate, which is tested using Monte Carlo simulations with four arbitrary discrete distributions. In comparison to the bootstrap method, the proposed interval construction method proves more efficient, particularly for experiments with a total offspring size below 400. We discuss handling cases where data are organized in extended life tables or as a matrix of vital rates. We have developed and provided accompanying code to facilitate these computations.

AB  - Each mutation in a population sample of DNA sequences can be classified by the number of sequences that inherit the mutant nucleotide, the resulting frequencies are known as mutations of different sizes or site frequency spectrum. Many summary statistics can be defined as a linear function of these frequencies. A flexible class of such linear summary statistics is explored analytically in this paper which include several well-known quantities, such as the number of segregating sizes and the mean number of nucleotide differences between two sequences. Some asymptotic variances and covariances are obtained while the analytical formulas for the variances and covariances of nine such linear summary statistics are derived, most of which are unknown to date. This study not only provides some theoretical foundations for exploring linear summary statistics, but also provides some newlinear summary statistics that may be utilized for analyzing sample polymorphism. Furthermore it is showed that a newly developed linear summary statistics has a smaller variance almost uniformly than Watterson's estimator, and that a class of linear summary statistics given too heavy weights on mutations of smaller sizes result in asymptotically non-zero variance.

AB  - We propose a predator-prey model to explain diachronic changes in Palaeolithic diet breadth. The fraction of rapidly-reproducing hard-to-catch hares and birds among small animals in the hominin diet shows a significant increase between the Middle and Upper Palaeolithic in the Levant, with an associated decrease in slowly-reproducing easily-caught tortoises. Our model interprets this fraction in terms of foraging effort allocated to, and foraging efficiency for each of these two classes of resource, in addition to their abundances. We focus on evolutionary adjustments in the allocation of foraging effort. The convergence stable strategy (CSS) of foraging effort and the dietary fraction of hares/birds are both highly sensitive to variation in the foraging efficiencies, which may have been upgraded by advanced technology introduced from Africa or developed locally. A positive correlation (not necessarily a cause and effect relationship) is observed between this fraction and forager population when the foraging efficiency for hares/birds is varied. Overexploitation can however result in a reduction of both diet breadth and forager population, as can food sharing within the forager group. Food sharing is routine among recent (and perhaps also Palaeolithic) foragers. We speculate that some controversial issues regarding this public goods problem might be resolved if we could incorporate sexual selection into our model. (c) 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - The evolution of cooperation in Prisoner's Dilemmas with additive random cost and benefit for cooperation cannot be accounted for by Hamilton's rule based on mean effects transferred from recipients to donors weighted by coefficients of relatedness, which defines inclusive fitness in a constant environment. Extensions that involve higher moments of stochastic effects are possible, however, and these are connected to a concept of random inclusive fitness that is frequency-dependent. This is shown in the setting of pairwise interactions in a haploid population with the same coefficient of relatedness between interacting players. In an infinite population, fixation of cooperation is stochastically stable if a mean geometric inclusive fitness of defection when rare is negative, while fixation of defection is stochastically unstable if a mean geometric inclusive fitness of cooperation when rare is positive, and these conditions are generally not equivalent. In a finite population, the probability for cooperation to ultimately fix when represented once exceeds the probability under neutrality or the corresponding probability for defection if the mean inclusive fitness of cooperation when its frequency is 1/3 or 1/2, respectively, exceeds 1. All these results rely on the simplifying assumption of a linear fitness function. It is argued that meaningful applications of random inclusive fitness in complex settings (multi-player game, diploidy, population structure) would generally require conditions of weak selection and additive gene action.

AB  - The site frequency spectrum (SFS) is a popular summary statistic of genomic data. While the SFS of a constant-sized population undergoing neutral mutations has been extensively studied in population genetics, the rapidly growing amount of cancer genomic data has attracted interest in the spectrum of an exponentially growing population. Recent theoretical results have generally dealt with special or limiting cases, such as considering only cells with an infinite line of descent, assuming deterministic tumor growth, or taking large-time or large-population limits. In this work, we derive exact expressions for the expected SFS of a cell population that evolves according to a stochastic branching process, first for cells with an infinite line of descent and then for the total population, evaluated either at a fixed time (fixed-time spectrum) or at the stochastic time at which the population reaches a certain size (fixed-size spectrum). We find that while the rate of mutation scales the SFS of the total population linearly, the rates of cell birth and cell death change the shape of the spectrum at the small-frequency end, inducing a transition between a 1/j(2) power-law spectrum and a 1/j spectrum as cell viability decreases. We show that this insight can in principle be used to estimate the ratio between the rate of cell death and cell birth, as well as the mutation rate, using the site frequency spectrum alone. Although the discussion is framed in terms of tumor dynamics, our results apply to any exponentially growing population of individuals undergoing neutral mutations. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Molecular sequences are shaped by selection, where the strength of selection relative to drift is determined by effective population size (N-e). Populations with high N-e are expected to undergo stronger purifying selection, and consequently to show a lower substitution rate for selected mutations relative to the substitution rate for neutral mutations (omega). However, computational models based on biophysics of protein stability have suggested that w can also be independent of N-e. Together, the response of omega to changes in N-e depends on the specific mapping from sequence to fitness. Importantly, an increase in protein expression level has been found empirically to result in decrease of omega, an observation predicted by theoretical models assuming selection for protein stability. Here, we derive a theoretical approximation for the response of omega to changes in N-e and expression level, under an explicit genotype-phenotype-fitness map. The method is generally valid for additive traits and log-concave fitness functions. We applied these results to protein undergoing selection for their conformational stability and corroborate out findings with simulations under more complex models. We predict a weak response of omega to changes in either N-e or expression level, which are interchangeable. Based on empirical data, we propose that fitness based on the conformational stability may not be a sufficient mechanism to explain the empirically observed variation in omega across species. Other aspects of protein biophysics might be explored, such as protein-protein interactions, which can lead to a stronger response of omega to changes in N-e. (C) 2021 The Authors.

AB  - The number of dines (i.e., polymorphic equilibria) maintained by a step-environment in a unidimensional pocket at a single diallelic locus is investigated. The monoecious population is locally panmictic; its density is uniform. Migration and viability selection are both weak; the former is homogeneous and symmetric; the latter is directional and usually specified by a unimodal function f(p) of the gene frequency p. If the ratio of the selection intensity to the migration rate exceeds a critical value, at least one dine exists. The general theorems on equilibrium structure determine it in detail for many classes off (p), including the cubic for frequency-independent selection. Numerical examples demonstrate that for suitable f (p), many equilibria can occur simultaneously. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The dynamics of long-term evolution in a complex genetically-structured population with a flux of random mutations is employed here to study the evolution of mutual altruism between relatives that are encountered repeatedly, where the level of altruism is measured by the risk one is willing to accept in order to save the life of one's relative. It is shown that regardless of the number of loci involved, of the rates of recombination among them, and of the intensity of the selection forces, the long-term dynamics can phenotypically converge only to a level of altruism that maximizes the individual inclusive fitness as it has previously defined by students of the individual approach to evolution. Except for the widely studied case of weak selection, however, the convergence to such a level of altruism is not necessarily generation-to-next monotone. It is further shown that, unlike the case of the one-shot encounter, repeated encounters between relatives allow for more than one level of altruism which may maximize the inclusive fitness, in which case not all such levels of altruism are evolutionarily accessible.

AB  - Inter-individual variance in longevity (or any other demographic outcome) may arise from heterogeneity or from individual stochasticity. Heterogeneity refers to differences among individuals in the demographic rates experienced at a given age or stage. Stochasticity refers to variation due to the random outcome of demographic rates applied to individuals with the same properties. The variance due to individual stochasticity can be calculated from a Markov chain description of the life cycle. The variance due to heterogeneity can be calculated from a multistate model that incorporates the heterogeneity. We show how to use this approach to decompose the variance in longevity into contributions from stochasticity and heterogeneous frailty for male and female cohorts from Sweden (1751-1899), France (1816-1903), and Italy (1872-1899), and also for a selection of period data for the same countries.
   Heterogeneity in mortality is described by the gamma-Gompertz Makeham model, in which a gamma distributed "frailty" modifies a baseline Gompertz Makeham mortality schedule. Model parameters were estimated by maximum likelihood for a range of starting ages. The estimates were used to construct an age x frailty-classified matrix model, from which we compute the variance of longevity and its components due to heterogeneous frailty and to individual stochasticity. The estimated fraction of the variance in longevity due to heterogeneous frailty (averaged over time) is less than 10% for all countries and for both sexes. These results suggest that most of the variance in human longevity arises from stochasticity, rather than from heterogeneous frailty. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The evolution of social traits remains one of the most fascinating and feisty topics in evolutionary biology even after half a century of theoretical research. W.D. Hamilton shaped much of the field initially with his 1964 papers that laid out the foundation for understanding the effect of genetic relatedness on the evolution of social behavior. Early theoretical investigations revealed two critical assumptions required for Hamilton's rule to hold in dynamical models: weak selection and additive genetic interactions. However, only recently have analytical approaches from population genetics and evolutionary game theory developed sufficiently so that social evolution can be studied under the joint action of selection, mutation, and genetic drift. We review how these approaches suggest two timescales for evolution under weak mutation: (i) a short-term timescale where evolution occurs between a finite set of alleles, and (ii) a long-term timescale where a continuum of alleles are possible and populations evolve continuously from one monomorphic trait to another. We show how Hamilton's rule emerges from the short-term analysis under additivity and how non-additive genetic interactions can be accounted for more generally. This short-term approach reproduces, synthesizes, and generalizes many previous results including the one-third law from evolutionary game theory and risk dominance from economic game theory. Using the long-term approach, we illustrate how trait evolution can be described with a diffusion equation that is a stochastic analogue of the canonical equation of adaptive dynamics. Peaks in the stationary distribution of the diffusion capture classic notions of convergence stability from evolutionary game theory and generally depend on the additive genetic interactions inherent in Hamilton's rule. Surprisingly, the peaks of the long-term stationary distribution can predict the effects of simple kinds of non-additive interactions. Additionally, the peaks capture both weak and strong effects of social payoffs in a manner difficult to replicate with the short-term approach. Together, the results from the short and long-term approaches suggest both how Hamilton's insight may be robust in unexpected ways and how current analytical approaches can expand our understanding of social evolution far beyond Hamilton's original work.

AB  - The formula for the probability of fixation of a new mutation is widely used in theoretical population genetics and molecular evolution. Here we derive a series of identities, inequalities and approximations for the exact probability of fixation of a new mutation under the Moran process (equivalent results hold for the approximate probability of fixation under the Wright-Fisher process, after an appropriate change of variables). We show that the logarithm of the fixation probability has particularly simple behavior when the selection coefficient is measured as a difference of Malthusian fitnesses, and we exploit this simplicity to derive inequalities and approximations. We also present a comprehensive comparison of both existing and new approximations for the fixation probability, highlighting those approximations that induce a reversible Markov chain when used to describe the dynamics of evolution under weak mutation. To demonstrate the power of these results, we consider the classical problem of determining the total substitution rate across an ensemble of biallelic loci and prove that, at equilibrium, a strict majority of substitutions are due to drift rather than selection.

AB  - In geographically structured populations, global panmixia can be regarded as the limiting case of long-distance migration. The effect of incorporating partial panmixia into diallelic single-locus dines (i.e., asymptotically stable equilibria) maintained by migration and selection in an isotropic environmental pocket in n dimensions is investigated. The population density is uniform. Migration and selection are both weak; the former is homogeneous and isotropic; the latter is directional. If the scaled panmictic rate beta >= 1, then the allele favored in the pocket is ultimately lost. For beta < 1, a dine is maintained if and only if the scaled radius a of the pocket exceeds a critical value a(n). For a step-environment without dominance, simple, explicit formulas are derived for a(1) and a(3); an equation with a unique solution and simple, explicit approximations are deduced for a(2). The ratio of the selection coefficients outside and inside the pocket is -alpha. As expected intuitively, the dine becomes more difficult to maintain; i.e., the critical radius a(n) increases for n = 1, 2, 3,... as alpha, beta, or n increases. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Modern developments in population dynamics emphasize the role of the turnover of individuals. In the new approaches stable population size is a dynamic equilibrium between different mortality and fecundity factors instead of an arbitrary fixed carrying capacity. The latest replicator dynamics models assume that regulation of the population size acts through feedback driven by density dependent juvenile mortality. Here, we consider a simplified model to extract the properties of this approach. We show that at the stable population size, the structure of the frequency dependent evolutionary game emerges. Turnover of individuals induces a lottery mechanism where for each nest site released by a dead adult individual a single newborn is drawn from the pool of newborn candidates. This frequency dependent selection leads towards the strategy maximizing the number of newborns per adult death. However, multiple strategies can maximize this value. Among them, the strategy with the greatest mortality (which implies the greatest instantaneous growth rate) is selected. This result is important for the discussion about universal fitness measures and which parameters are maximized by natural selection. This is related to the fitness measures R-o and r, because the number of newborns per single dead individual equals the lifetime production of newborn R-o in models without aging. We thus have a two-stage procedure, instead of a single fitness measure, which is a combination of R-o and r. According to the nest site lottery mechanism, at stable population size, selection favors strategies with the greatest r, i.e. those with the highest turnover, from those with the greatest R-o.(c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Predation interactions are an important element of ecological communities. Population spatial structure has been shown to influence predator evolution, resulting in the evolution of a reduced predator attack rate; however, the evolutionary role of traits governing predator and prey ecology is unknown. The evolutionary effect of spatial structure on a predator's attack rate has primarily been explored assuming a fixed metapopulation spatial structure, and understood in terms of group selection. But endogenously generated, emergent spatial structure is common in nature. Furthermore, the evolutionary influence of ecological traits may be mediated through the spatial self-structuring process. Drawing from theory on pathogens, the evolutionary effect of emergent spatial structure can be understood in terms of self-shading, where a voracious predator limits its long-term invasion potential by reducing local prey availability. Here we formalize the effects of self-shading for predators using spatial moment equations. Then, through simulations, we show that in a spatial context self-shading leads to relationships between predator prey ecology and the predator's attack rate that are not expected in a non-spatial context. Some relationships are analogous to relationships already shown for host pathogen interactions, but others represent new trait dimensions. Finally, since understanding the effects of ecology using existing self-shading theory requires simplifications of the emergent spatial structure that do not apply well here, we also develop metrics describing the complex spatial structure of the predator and prey populations to help us explain the evolutionary effect of predator and prey ecology in the context of self-shading. The identification of these metrics may provide a step towards expansion of the predictive domain of self-shading theory to more complex spatial dynamics. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - When novel disease outbreaks occur in livestock, policy makers must respond promptly to eliminate disease, and are typically called on to make control decisions before detailed analysis of disease parameters can be undertaken. We present a flexible metapopulation model of disease spread that incorporates variation in livestock density and includes occasional high-mixing locations or events, such as markets or race meetings. Using probability generating functions derived from this branching process model, we compare the likely success of reactive control strategies in eliminating disease spread. We find that the optimal vaccine strategy varies according to the disease transmission rate, with homogeneous vaccination most effective for low transmission rates, and heterogeneous vaccination preferable for high levels of transmission. Quarantine combines well with vaccination, with the chance of disease elimination enhanced even for vaccines with low efficacy. Control decisions surrounding horse race meetings were of particular concern during the 2007 outbreak of equine influenza in Australia. We show that this type of high-mixing event is a powerful spread mechanism, even when the proportion of time spent at such events is low. If such locations remain open, elimination will require a highly effective vaccine with high coverage. However, a policy of banning animals from quarantined regions from attending such events can provide an effective alternative if full closure of events is economically or politically untenable.

AB  - In classical demographic theory, reproductive value and stable age distribution are proportional to the sensitivities of the asymptotic population size to changes in mortality and maternity, respectively. In this note we point out that analogous relationships hold if the maternity function is allowed to depend on the population density. The relevant formulae can essentially be obtained by replacing the growth rate ("Lotka's r") with zero. These facts may be used to derive heuristics for population management (pest control).

AB  - In asymmetric competition between two individuals of the same or different species, one individual has a distinct advantage over the other due to a particular beneficial trait. An important trait that induces asymmetric competition is size (body size in animals, height in plants). There is usually a trade-off between fecundity and the trait that leads to competitive superiority (e.g. seed number vs seed size), enabling coexistence of populations with different trait values. These predictions on coexistence are based on classic deterministic models. Here, we explore the behaviour of a stochastic model of asymmetric competition where stochasticity is assumed to be demographic. We derive approximations for the temporal variance and covariance of the population sizes of the coexisting species. The derivations highlight that the variability of the population size of a species strongly depends on the stochastic fluctuations of species with higher trait values, while they are less influenced by species with lower trait values. Particularly, species with intermediate trait values are strongly affected resulting in relatively high variability. As a result these species have a relative high probability of extinction even though they have a larger population size than species with high trait values. We confirm these approximations with individual-based simulations. Thus, our analysis can explain gaps in size distributions as an emergent property of systems with a fecundity-competition trade-off.

AB  - We developed a simple linear stochastic model for Dalbulus maidis dependent exclusively on temperature, whose parameters were determined from published field and laboratory studies performed at different temperatures. This model takes into account the principal stages and events of the life cycle of this pest, which is vector of maize diseases. We implemented the effect of distributed delays or Linear Chain Trick (LCT) considering a fixed number of sub-stages for egg and nymph stages of Dalbulus maidis in order to accurately represent what is observed in nature. A sensitivity analysis allows us to observe that the speed of the dynamics is sensitive to changes in the development rates, but not to the longevity of each stage or the fecundity, which almost exclusively affect insect abundance. We used our model to study its predictive and explanatory capacity considering a published experiment as a case study. Although the simulation results show a behavior qualitatively equivalent to that observed in the experimental results it is not possible to explain accurately the magnitude, nor the times in which the maximum abundances of second-generation nymphs and adults are reached. Therefore, we evaluated three possible scenarios for the insect that allow us to glimpse some of the advantages of having a computational model in order to find out what processes, taken into account in the model, may explain the differences observed between published experimental results and model results. The three proposed scenarios, based on variations in the parameterized rates of the model, can satisfactorily explain the experimental observations. We observed that in order to better simulate the experimental results it is not necessary to modify fecundity or mortality rates. However, it is necessary to accelerate the average development rates of our model by 20 to 40 %, compatible with extreme values of the rates close to the upper edges of the confidence bands of our parameterization rate curves, according to insects with faster development rates already reported in literature.(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - General patterns that are observed in forests irrespective of their ecological biome or species composition are indicators of general biological processes that drive forest dynamics. Modelling can be used to infer these processes by identifying the minimum set of rules that generate the observed patterns. The regular spatial pattern of the largest trees, the decreasing skewness of the tree diameter distribution in young developing stands, and the size bimodality that may result from the tail of dominated trees are three general patterns observed in natural forests. Using a simple individual-based space-dependent growth model based on asymmetric competition between trees and space-independent approximations of this model, the objectives were (1) to identify a single mechanism that may explain these three patterns, and (2) to clarify the role of space in the emergence of these patterns. The space-dependent model was able to qualitatively generate the three patterns. Through cascading spatial interactions, competition resulted in the establishment of a spatially structured competitive hierarchy among trees. A second-order approximation of the space-dependent model was derived by structuring the population of trees according to diameter and competitive status. This second-order approximation succeeded in predicting left-skewed diameter distributions but did not predict diameter bimodality. Asymmetric competition thus seems to be an important driver of tree growth and the cause rather than the consequence of bimodality. The second-order approximation of the space-dependent model may be useful to generalize the stationary diameter distributions developed in the demographic equilibrium theory. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - A coalescent model of a sample of size n is derived from a birth-death process that originates at a random time in the past from a single founder individual. Over time, the descendants of the founder evolve into a population of large (infinite) size from which a sample of size n is taken. The parameters and time of the birth-death process are scaled in N-0, the size of the present-day population, while letting N-0 -> infinity, similarly to how the standard Kingman coalescent process arises from the Wright-Fisher model. The model is named the Limit Birth-Death (LBD) coalescent model. Simulations from the LBD coalescent model with sample size n are computationally slow compared to standard coalescent models. Therefore, we suggest different approximations to the LBD coalescent model assuming the population size is a deterministic function of time rather than a stochastic process. Furthermore, we introduce a hybrid LBD coalescent model, that combines the exactness of the LBD coalescent model model with the speed of the approximations. (C) 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Consanguineous unions increase the frequency at which identical genomic segments are inherited along separate paths of descent, decreasing coalescence times for pairs of alleles drawn from an individual who is the offspring of a consanguineous pair. For an autosomal locus, it has recently been shown that the mean time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) for two alleles in the same individual and the mean TMRCA for two alleles in two separate individuals both decrease with increasing consanguinity in a population. Here, we extend this analysis to the X chromosome, considering X-chromosomal coalescence times under a coalescent model with diploid, male-female mating pairs. We examine four possible first-cousin mating schemes that are equivalent in their effects on autosomes, but that have differing effects on the X chromosome: patrilateral-parallel, patrilateralcross, matrilateral-parallel, and matrilateral-cross. In each mating model, we calculate mean TMRCA for X-chromosomal alleles sampled either within or between individuals. We describe a consanguinity effect on X-chromosomal TMRCA that differs from the autosomal pattern under matrilateral but not under patrilateral first-cousin mating. For matrilateral first cousins, the effect of consanguinity in reducing TMRCA is stronger on the X chromosome than on the autosomes, with an increased effect of parallel-cousin mating compared to cross-cousin mating. The theoretical computations support the utility of the model in understanding patterns of genomic sharing on the X chromosome. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - We derive statistical tools to analyze the patterns of genetic variability produced by models related to seed banks; in particular the Kingman coalescent, its time-changed counterpart describing so-called weak seed banks, the strong seed bank coalescent, and the two-island structured coalescent. As (strong) seed banks stratify a population, we expect them to produce a signal comparable to population structure. We present tractable formulas for Wright's F-ST and the expected site frequency spectrum for these models, and show that they can distinguish between some models for certain ranges of parameters. We then use pseudo-marginal MCMC to show that the full likelihood can reliably distinguish between all models in the presence of parameter uncertainty under moderate stratification, and point out statistical pitfalls arising from stratification that is either too strong or too weak. We further show that it is possible to infer parameters, and in particular determine whether mutation is taking place in the (strong) seed bank. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Mosquitoes cause more human suffering than any other organism. It is estimated that over one million people worldwide die from mosquito-borne diseases every year. With the continuous efforts of many researchers, Wolbachia gets more and more attention due to its characteristics of maternal transmission in mosquito population and it may cause cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) which makes healthy females cannot fertilize normally after mating with infected males. In this paper, mathematical models are established to study Wolbachia transmission in mosquito population, and integrated mosquito control strategies are explored. Firstly, a classical ordinary differential system with general birth and death rate functions is established to describe the maternal transmission and CI effect. It is shown that the replacement strategy that the Wolbachia-uninfected mosquitoes are replaced by the infected ones is determined by the initial infection frequency. And Wolbachia spreads more easily for greater maternal transmission and CI rate. Moreover, all the wild mosquitoes will eventually be infected with Wolbachia if the maternal transmission is complete. Secondly, an impulsive state feedback control model is constructed to describe the integrated mosquito control. Besides Wolbachia, insecticides are sprayed when the quantity of mosquitoes reaches some Economic Threshold. The existence and stability of Wolbachia replacement periodic solution are discussed. Finally, some discussions are done and the future research directions are prospected. Keywords: Mosquito-borne diseases Wolbachia Insecticide spraying Impulsive state feedback control.

AB  - Phylogenetic comparative methods (PCMs) have been used to study the evolution of quantitative traits in various groups of organisms, ranging from micro-organisms to animal and plant species. A common approach has been to assume a Gaussian phylogenetic model for the trait evolution along the tree, such as a branching Brownian motion (BM) or an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process. Then, the parameters of the process have been inferred based on a given tree and trait data for the sampled species. At the heart of this inference lie multiple calculations of the model likelihood, that is, the probability density of the observed trait data, conditional on the model parameters and the tree. With the increasing availability of big phylogenetic trees, spanning hundreds to several thousand sampled species, this approach is facing a two-fold challenge. First, the assumption of a single Gaussian process governing the entire tree is not adequate in the presence of heterogeneous evolutionary forces acting in different parts of the tree. Second, big trees present a computational challenge, due to the time and memory complexity of the model likelihood calculation.
   Here, we explore a sub-family, denoted G(LInv) , of the Gaussian phylogenetic models, with the transition density exhibiting the properties that the expectation depends Linearly on the ancestral trait value and the variance is Invariant with respect to the ancestral value. We show that G(LInv), contains the vast majority of Gaussian models currently used in PCMs, while supporting an efficient (linear in the number of nodes) algorithm for the likelihood calculation. The algorithm supports scenarios with missing data, as well as different types of trees, including trees with polytomies and non-ultrametric trees. To account for the heterogeneity in the evolutionary forces, the algorithm supports models with "shifts" occurring at specific points in the tree. Such shifts can include changes in some or all parameters, as well as the type of the model, provided that the model remains within the G(LInv) family. This contrasts with most of the current implementations where, due to slow likelihood calculation, the shifts are restricted to specific parameters in a single type of model, such as the long-term selection optima of an OU process, assuming that all of its other parameters, such as evolutionary rate and selection strength, are global for the entire tree.
   We provide an implementation of this likelihood calculation algorithm in an accompanying R-package called PCMBase. The package has been designed as a generic library that can be integrated with existing or novel maximum likelihood or Bayesian inference tools. (C) 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The outcome of natural selection depends on the demographic processes of birth, death, and development. Here, we derive conditions for protected polymorphism in a population characterized by age- or stage-dependent demography with two sexes. We do so using a novel two-sex matrix population model including basic Mendelian genetics (one locus, two alleles, random mating). Selection may operate on survival, growth, or fertility, any or all of which may differ between the sexes. The model can therefore incorporate genes with arbitrary pleiotropic and sex-specific effects. Conditions for protected polymorphism are expressed in terms of the eigenvalues of the linearization of the model at the homozygote boundary equilibria. We show that in the absence of sexual dimorphism, polymorphism requires heterozygote superiority in the genotypic population growth rate. In the presence of sexual dimorphism, however, heterozygote superiority is not required; an inferior heterozygote may invade, reducing the population growth rate and even leading to extinction (so-called evolutionary suicide). Our model makes no assumptions about separation of time scales between ecological and evolutionary processes, and can thus be used to project sex x stage x genotype dynamics of eco-evolutionary processes. Empirical evidence that sexual dimorphism affects extinction risk is growing, yet sex differences are often ignored in evolutionary demography and in eco-evolutionary models. Our analysis highlights the importance of sexual dimorphism and suggests mechanisms by which an allele can be favored by selection, yet drive a population to extinction, as a result of the structure and interdependence of sex- and stage-specific processes.

AB  - Advances in structural biology of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) have revealed incredible diversity in how aaRSs bind their tRNA substrates. The causes of this diversity remain mysterious. We developed a new class of highly rugged fitness landscape models called match landscapes, through which genes encode the assortative interactions of their gene products through the complementarity and identifiability of their structural features. We used results from coding theory to prove bounds and equalities on fitness in match landscapes assuming additive interaction energies, macroscopic aminoacylation kinetics including proofreading, site-specific modifiers of interaction, and selection for translational accuracy in multiple, perfectly encoded site-types. Using genotypes based on extended Hamming codes we show that over a wide array of interface sizes and numbers of encoded cognate pairs, selection for translational accuracy alone is insufficient to displace the tRNA-binding interfaces of aaRSs. Yet, under combined selection for translational accuracy and rate, site-specific modifiers are selected to adaptively displace the tRNA-binding interfaces of non-cognate aaRS-tRNA pairs. We describe a remarkable correspondence between the lengths of perfect RNA (quaternary) codes and the modal sizes of small non-coding RNA families. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Harvesting in space affects, in general, the spatial scale of the synchrony in the population fluctuations, which determines the size of the areas subjected to simultaneous quasi-extinction risk. Here we show that harvesting reduces the population synchrony scale if it depends more strongly on population fluctuations than the density dependence of the growth rate in the absence of harvesting. We show that constant and proportional harvesting always increases the spatial scale, using a theta-logistic model for density regulation. We also provide exact scaling results under harvesting for the Beverton-Holt and the Ricker stock-recruitment models that are commonly applied, e.g. in fisheries. Our results indicate that harvest in areas with large abundances should be encouraged to avoid increase of the spatial scale of synchrony in the population fluctuations that can lead to unexpected quasi-extinction of populations over large areas. Our results quantify this harvesting impact giving the resulting scales of spatial synchrony of population fluctuations. This emphasizes the importance of estimating the form of density dependence as well as the dependency of harvest upon population density of exploited populations, in order to get reliable predictions of the size of areas that can undergo simultaneous quasi-extinction.

AB  - Contrary to what is often assumed in population genetics, independently segregating loci do not have completely independent ancestries, since all loci are inherited through a single, shared population pedigree. Previous work has shown that the non-independence between gene genealogies of independently segregating loci created by the population pedigree is weak in panmictic populations, and predictions made from standard coalescent theory are accurate for populations that are at least moderately sized. Here, we investigate patterns of coalescence in pedigrees of structured populations. We find that the pedigree creates deviations away from the predictions of the structured coalescent that persist on a longer timescale than in the case of panmictic populations. Nevertheless, we find that the structured coalescent provides a reasonable approximation for the coalescent process in structured population pedigrees so long as migration events are moderately frequent and there are no migration events in the recent pedigree of the sample. When there are migration events in the recent sample pedigree, we find that distributions of coalescence in the sample can be modeled as a mixture of distributions from different initial sample configurations. We use this observation to motivate a maximum-likelihood approach for inferring migration rates and mutation rates jointly with features of the pedigree such as recent migrant ancestry and recent relatedness. Using simulation, we show that our inference framework accurately recovers long-term migration rates in the presence of recent migration events in the sample pedigree. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Lack of successful mating encounters in two-sex insect populations is a mechanism that might trigger reproductive Allee effects. In this paper I examine a function that models ephemeral mating encounters through the expected density of pairs formed by individuals of both sexes at any time. When this function is incorporated in a general system of differential equations for a two-sex population the solutions exhibit the emergence of an Allee effect for low population densities. Compared with current conceptual models for mate-finding Allee effects, the proposed pairing function does not include a parameter that quantifies the Allee effect strength, a feature that might be useful when information to parameterize Allee effects is unavailable. The mating function is then used to numerically explore how mate-finding Allee effects are enhanced by the release of sterile males in theoretical models where (i) the initial sex ratio is skewed, (ii) sterile males are released in pulses and (iii) partial female remating is allowed.

AB  - Migrational mortality is introduced into the classical Malecot model for migration, mutation, and random genetic drift. To assess the influence of mortality, its effect on the backward migration rates and on the probabilities of identity in allelic state are studied. Perhaps surprisingly, some of the former may increase, but as is intuitive, their sum always decreases. As expected, in the island model, mortality does not change the migration pattern, but it decreases the migration rate. Furthermore, it decreases the expected heterozygosity, but increases the genetic diversity and differentiation. The circular habitat and the unbounded, linear stepping-stone model also illustrate the general results. Arbitrary migration is also analyzed. If migration is sufficiently weak, then mortality diminishes every migration rate; it decreases the expected heterozygosity and the genetic similarity between demes. In the strong-migration limit, mortality may raise or lower the probability of identity in state. Perhaps unexpectedly, under mild and reasonable biological assumptions, mortality does not alter the diffusion limit of the probabilities of identity. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Comparisons between mass-action or "random" network models and empirical networks have produced mixed results. Here we seek to discover whether a simulated disease spread through randomly constructed networks can be coerced to model the spread in empirical networks by altering a single disease parameter - the probability of infection. A stochastic model for disease spread through herds of cattle is utilised to model the passage of an SEIR (susceptible-latent-infected-resistant) through five networks. The first network is an empirical network of recorded contacts, from four datasets available, and the other four networks are constructed from randomly distributed contacts based on increasing amounts of information from the recorded network, A numerical study on adjusting the value of the probability of infection was conducted for the four random network models. We found that relative percentage reductions in the probability of infection, between 5.6% and 39.4% in the random network models, produced results that most closely mirrored the results from the empirical contact networks. In all cases tested, to reduce the differences between the two models, required a reduction in the probability of infection in the random network. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Recent studies have shown that gene families from different functional categories have been preferentially expanded either by small scale duplication (SSD) or by whole-genome duplication (WGD). In particular, gene families prone to dominant deleterious mutations and implicated in cancers and other genetic diseases in human have been greatly expanded through two rounds of WGD dating back from early vertebrates. Here, we strengthen this intriguing observation, showing that human oncogenes involved in different primary tumors have retained many WGD duplicates compared to other human genes. In order to rationalize this evolutionary outcome, we propose a consistent population genetics model to analyze the retention of SSD and WGD duplicates taking into account their propensity to acquire dominant deleterious mutations. We solve a deterministic haploid model including initial duplicated loci, their retention through sub-functionalization or their neutral loss-of-function or deleterious gain-of-function at one locus. Extensions to diploid genotypes are presented and population size effects, are analyzed using stochastic simulations. The only difference between the SSD and WGD scenarios is the initial number of individuals with duplicated loci. While SSD duplicates need to spread through the entire population from a single individual to reach fixation, WGD duplicates are de facto fixed in the small initial post-WGD population arising through the ploidy incompatibility between post-WGD individuals and the rest of the pre-WGD population. WGD duplicates prone to dominant deleterious mutations are then shown to be indirectly selected through purifying selection in post-WGD species, whereas SSD duplicates typically require positive selection. These results highlight the long-term evolution mechanisms behind the surprising accumulation of WGD duplicates prone to dominant deleterious mutations and are shown to be consistent with cancer genome data on the prevalence of human oncogenes with WGD duplicates.

AB  - Sink populations are doomed to decline to extinction in the absence of immigration. The dynamics of sink populations are not easily modelled using the standard framework of per capita rates of immigration, because numbers of immigrants are determined by extrinsic sources (for example, source populations, or population managers). Here we appeal to a systems and control framework to place upper and lower bounds on both the transient and future dynamics of sink populations that are subject to noisy immigration. Immigration has a number of interpretations and can fit a wide variety of models found in the literature. We apply the results to case studies derived from published models for Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and blowout penstemon (Penstemon haydenii). (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Forward-in-time models of diversification (i.e., speciation and extinction) produce phylogenetic trees that grow "vertically" as time goes by. Pruning the extinct lineages out of such trees leads to natural models for reconstructed trees (i.e., phylogenies of extant species). Alternatively, reconstructed trees can be modelled by coalescent point processes (CPPs), where trees grow "horizontally" by the sequential addition of vertical edges. Each new edge starts at some random speciation time and ends at the present time; speciation times are drawn from the same distribution independently. CPPs lead to extremely fast computation of tree likelihoods and simulation of reconstructed trees. Their topology always follows the uniform distribution on ranked tree shapes (URT).
   We characterize which forward-in-time models lead to URT reconstructed trees and among these, which lead to CPP reconstructed trees. We show that for any "asymmetric" diversification model in which speciation rates only depend on time and extinction rates only depend on time and on a non-heritable trait (e.g., age), the reconstructed tree is CPP, even if extant species are incompletely sampled. If rates additionally depend on the number of species, the reconstructed tree is (only) URT (but not CPP). We characterize the common distribution of speciation times in the CPP description, and discuss incomplete species sampling as well as three special model cases in detail: (1) the extinction rate does not depend on a trait; (2) rates do not depend on time; (3) mass extinctions may happen additionally at certain points in the past.

AB  - Species with a large adult offspring size ratio and a preferred predator prey mass ratio undergo ontogenetic trophic niche shift(s) throughout life. Trophic interactions between such species vary throughout life, resulting in different species-level interaction motifs depending on the maximum adult sizes and population size distributions. We explore the assembly and potential for coexistence of small communities where all species experience ontogenetic trophic niche shifts. The life-history of each species is described by a physiologically structured model and species identity is characterised by the trait: size at maturation. We show that a single species can exist in two different states: a 'resource driven state' and a 'cannibalistic state' with a large scope for emergent Allee effects and bistable states. Two species can coexist in two different configurations: in a 'competitive coexistence' state when the ratio between sizes at maturation of the two species is less than a predator prey mass ratio and the resource level is low to intermediate, or in a 'trophic ladder' state if the ratio of sizes at maturation is larger than the predator prey mass ratio at all resource levels. While there is a large scope for coexistence of two species, the scope for coexistence of three species is limited and we conclude that further trait differentiation is required for coexistence of more species-rich size-structured communities.

AB  - We study the asymptotics of the extended Moran model as the total population size N tends to infinity. Two convergence results are provided, the first result leading to discrete-time limiting coalescent processes and the second result leading to continuous-time limiting coalescent processes. The limiting coalescent processes allow for multiple mergers of ancestral lineages (Lambda-coalescent). It is furthermore verified that any continuous time Lambda-coalescent (with Lambda any probability distribution) can arise in the limit. Typical examples of extended Moran models are discussed, with an emphasis on models being in the domain of attraction of beta coalescents or Lambda-coalescents with Lambda being log infinitely divisible.

AB  - Differences in transgenerational epigenetic stability can result in a diversity of phenotypes among genetically identical individuals. Here we present a model that encapsulates non-genomic phenotypic variation in a population over two distinct environments that each act as a stimulus for epigenetic modification. By allowing different levels of epigenetic resetting, thereby increasing epigenetic diversity, we explore the dynamics of multiple epiallelic states subject to selection in a population-epigenetic model. We find that both epigenetic resetting and the environmental frequency are crucial parameters in this system. Our results illustrate the regions of parameter space that enable up to three equilibria to be simultaneously locally stable. Furthermore, it is clear that both continued environmental induction and epigenetic resetting prevent epigenetic fixation, maintaining phenotypic variation through different epiallelic states. However, unless both environments are reasonably common, levels of epigenetically-maintained variation are low. We argue that it is vital that non-genomic phenotypic diversity is not ignored in evolutionary theory, but instead regarded as distinct epiallelic variants. Ultimately, a critical goal of future experiments should be to determine accurate rates of epigenetic resetting, especially over several generations, in order to establish the long-term significance of epigenetic inheritance.

AB  - this paper, we investigate the consequences of dormancy in the 'rare mutation' and 'large population' regime of stochastic adaptive dynamics. Starting from an individual -based micro -model, we first derive the Polymorphic Evolution Sequence of the population, based on a previous work by Baar and Bovier (2018). After passing to a second 'small mutations' limit, we arrive at the Canonical Equation of Adaptive Dynamics, and state a corresponding criterion for evolutionary branching, extending a previous result of Champagnat and Meleard (2011). The criterion allows a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the effects of dormancy in the well-known model of Dieckmann and Doebeli (1999) for sympatric speciation. In fact, quite an intuitive picture emerges: Dormancy enlarges the parameter range for evolutionary branching, increases the carrying capacity and niche width of the post -branching sub -populations, and, depending on the model parameters, can either increase decrease the 'speed of adaptation' of populations. Finally, dormancy increases diversity by increasing the genetic distance between subpopulations.

AB  - We develop a spatially realistic model of mutualistic metacommunities that exploits the joint structure of spatial and interaction networks. Assuming that all species have the same colonisation and extinction parameters, this model exhibits a sharp transition between stable non -null equilibrium states and a global extinction state. This behaviour allows defining a threshold on colonisation/extinction parameters for the long-term metacommunity persistence. This threshold, the 'metacommunity capacity', extends the metapopulation capacity concept and can be calculated from the spatial and interaction networks without needing to simulate the whole dynamics. In several applications we illustrate how the joint structure of the spatial and the interaction networks affects metacommunity capacity. It results that a weakly modular spatial network and a power -law degree distribution of the interaction network provide the most favourable configuration for the long-term persistence of a mutualistic metacommunity. Our model that encodes several explicit ecological assumptions should pave the way for a larger exploration of spatially realistic metacommunity models involving multiple interaction types.

AB  - The colonization model formulates competition among propagules for habitable sites to colonize, which serves as a mechanism enabling coexistence of multiple species. This model traditionally assumes that encounters between propagules and sites occur as mass action events, under which species distribution can eventually reach an equilibrium state with multiple species in a constant environment. To investigate the effects of encounter mode on species diversity, we analyzed community dynamics in the colonization model by varying encounter processes. The analysis indicated that equilibrium is approximately neutrally-stable under perfect ratio-dependent encounter, resulting in temporally con-tinuous variation of species' frequencies with irregular trajectories even under a constant environment. Although the trajectories significantly depend on initial conditions, they are considered to be "strange nonchaotic attractors"(SNAs) rather than chaos from the asymptotic growth rates of displacement. In addition, trajectories with different initial conditions remain different through time, indicating that the system involves an infinite number of SNAs. This analysis presents a novel mechanism for transient dynamics under competition. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The egalitarian allotment of gametes to each allele at a locus (Mendel's law of segregation) is a near-universal phenomenon characterizing inheritance in sexual populations. As exceptions to Mendel's law are known to occur, one can investigate why non-Mendelian segregation is not more common using modifier theory. Earlier work assuming sex-independent modifier effects in a random mating population with heterozygote advantage concluded that equal segregation is stable over long-term evolution. Subsequent investigation, however, demonstrated that the stability of the Mendelian scheme disappears when sex-specific modifier effects are allowed. Here I derive invasion conditions favoring the repeal of Mendelian law in mixed and obligate selfing populations. Oppositely-directed segregation distortion in the production of male and female gametes is selected for in the presence of overdominant fitness. The conditions are less restrictive than under panmixia in that strong selection can occur even without differential viability of reciprocal heterozygotes (i.e. in the absence of parent-of-origin effects at the overdominant fitness locus). Generalized equilibria are derived for full selfing. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The majority of population genetic theory assumes fully haploid or diploid organisms with obligate sexuality, despite complex life cycles with alternating generations being commonly observed. To reveal how natural selection and genetic drift shape the evolution of haploid-diploid populations, we analyze a stochastic genetic model for populations that consist of a mixture of haploid and diploid individuals, allowing for asexual reproduction and niche separation between haploid and diploid stages. Applying a diffusion approximation, we derive the fixation probability and describe its dependence on the reproductive values of haploid and diploid stages, which depend strongly on the extent of asexual reproduction in each phase and on the ecological differences between them.

AB  - Recent modeling studies interested in runs of homozygosity (ROH) and identity by descent (IBD) have sought to connect these properties of genomic sharing to pairwise coalescence times. Here, we examine a variety of features of pairwise coalescence times in models that consider consanguinity. In particular, we extend a recent diploid analysis of mean coalescence times for lineage pairs within and between individuals in a consanguineous population to derive the variance of coalescence times, studying its dependence on the frequency of consanguinity and the kinship coefficient of consanguineous relationships. We also introduce a separation-of-time-scales approach that treats consanguinity models analogously to mathematically similar phenomena such as partial selfing, using this approach to obtain coalescence-time distributions. This approach shows that the consanguinity model behaves similarly to a standard coalescent, scaling population size by a factor 1 - 3c, where c represents the kinship coefficient of a randomly chosen mating pair. It provides the explanation for an earlier result describing mean coalescence time in the consanguinity model in terms of c. The results extend the potential to make predictions about ROH and IBD in relation to demographic parameters of diploid populations. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this paper we investigate the interplay between two fundamental mechanisms of microbial population dynamics and evolution, namely dormancy and horizontal gene transfer. The corresponding traits come in many guises and are ubiquitous in microbial communities, affecting their dynamics in important ways. Recently, they have each moved (separately) into the focus of stochastic individual-based modelling (Billiard et al. 2016, 2018; Champagnat, Meleard and Tran, 2021; Blath and Tobias 2020). Here, we investigate their combined effects in a unified model. Indeed, we consider the (idealized) scenario of two sub-populations, respectively carrying 'trait 1' and 'trait 2', where trait 1 individuals are able to switch (under competitive pressure) into a dormant state, and trait 2 individuals are able to execute horizontal gene transfer, which in our case means that they can turn trait 1 individuals into trait 2 ones, at a rate depending on the density of individuals.
   In the large-population limit, we examine the fate of (i) a single trait 2 individual (called 'mutant') arriving in a trait 1 resident population living in equilibrium, and (ii) a trait 1 individual ('mutant') arriving in a trait 2 resident population. We analyse the invasion dynamics in all cases where the resident population is individually fit and the behaviour of the mutant population is initially non-critical. This leads to the identification of parameter regimes for the invasion and fixation of the new trait, stable coexistence of the two traits, and 'founder control' (where the initial resident always dominates, irrespective of its trait).
   One of our key findings is that horizontal transfer can lead to stable coexistence even if trait 2 is unfit on its own. In the case of founder control, the limiting dynamical system also exhibits a coexistence equilibrium, which, however, is unstable, and with overwhelming probability none of the mutant sub-populations is able to invade. In all cases, we observe the classical (up to three) phases of invasion dynamics a la Champagnat (2006). (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The multispecies coalescent process models the genealogical relationships of genes sampled from several species, enabling useful predictions about phenomena such as the discordance between a gene tree and the species phylogeny due to incomplete lineage sorting. Conversely, knowledge of large collections of gene trees can inform us about several aspects of the species phylogeny, such as its topology and ancestral population sizes. A fundamental open problem in this context is how to efficiently compute the probability of a gene tree topology, given the species phylogeny. Although a number of algorithms for this task have been proposed, they either produce approximate results, or, when they are exact, they do not scale to large data sets. In this paper, we present some progress towards exact and efficient computation of the probability of a gene tree topology. We provide a new algorithm that, given a species tree and the number of genes sampled for each species, calculates the probability that the gene tree topology will be concordant with the species tree. Moreover, we provide an algorithm that computes the probability of any specific gene tree topology concordant with the species tree. Both algorithms run in polynomial time and have been implemented in Python. Experiments show that they are able to analyze data sets where thousands of genes are sampled in a matter of minutes to hours. (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Resistance to insecticide is considered nowadays one of the major threats to insect control, as its occurrence reduces drastically the efficiency of chemical control campaigns, and may also perturb the application of other control methods, like biological and genetic control. In order to account for the emergence and spread of such phenomenon as an effect of exposition to larvicide and/or adulticide, we develop in this paper a general time-continuous population model with two life phases, subsequently simplified through slow manifold theory. The derived models present density-dependent recruitment and mortality rates in a non-conventional way. We show that in absence of selection, they evolve in compliance with Hardy-Weinberg law; while in presence of selection and in the dominant or codominant cases, convergence to the fittest genotype occurs. The proposed mathematical models should allow for the study of several issues of importance related to the use of insecticides and other adaptive phenomena. (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Populations whose mating pairs have levels of similarity in phenotypes or genotypes that differ systematically from the level expected under random mating are described as experiencing assortative mating. Excess similarity in mating pairs is termed positive assortative mating, and excess dissimilarity is negative assortative mating. In humans, empirical studies suggest that mating pairs from various admixed populations - whose ancestry derives from two or more source populations - possess correlated ancestry components that indicate the occurrence of positive assortative mating on the basis of ancestry. Generalizing a two-sex mechanistic admixture model, we devise a model of one form of ancestry-assortative mating that occurs through preferential mating based on source population. Under the model, we study the moments of the admixture fraction distribution for different assumptions about mating preferences, including both positive and negative assortative mating by population. We demonstrate that whereas the mean admixture under assortative mating is equivalent to that of a corresponding randomly mating population, the variance of admixture depends on the level and direction of assortative mating. We consider two special cases of assortative mating by population: first, a single admixture event, and second, constant contributions to the admixed population over time. In contrast to standard settings in which positive assortment increases variation within a population, certain assortative mating scenarios allow the variance of admixture to decrease relative to a corresponding randomly mating population: with the three populations we consider, the variance-increasing effect of positive assortative mating within a population might be overwhelmed by a variance-decreasing effect emerging from mating preferences involving other pairs of populations. The effect of assortative mating is smaller on the X chromosome than on the autosomes because inheritance of the X in males depends only on the mother's ancestry, not on the mating pair. Because the variance of admixture is informative about the timing of admixture and possibly about sex-biased admixture contributions, the effects of assortative mating are important to consider in inferring features of population history from distributions of admixture values. Our model provides a framework to quantitatively study assortative mating under flexible scenarios of admixture over time. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Trade-offs between dispersal and reproduction are known to be important drivers of population dynamics, but their direct influence on the spreading speed of a population is not well understood. Using integrodifference equations, we develop a model that incorporates a dispersal-reproduction trade-off which allows for a variety of different shaped trade-off curves. We show there is a unique reproductive-dispersal allocation that gives the largest value for the spreading speed and calculate the sensitivities of the reproduction, dispersal, and trade-off shape parameters. Uncertainty in the model parameters affects the expected spread of the population and we calculate the optimal allocation of resources to dispersal that maximizes the expected spreading speed. Higher allocation to dispersal arises from uncertainty in the reproduction parameter or the shape of the reproduction trade-off curve. Lower allocation to dispersal arises from uncertainty in the shape of the dispersal trade-off curve, but does not come from uncertainty in the dispersal parameter. Our findings give insight into how parameter sensitivity and uncertainty influence the spreading speed of a population with a dispersal-reproduction trade-off. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - There is growing theoretical evidence that spatial structure can affect the ecological and evolutionary outcomes of host-parasite interactions. Locally restricted interactions have been shown in particular to affect host resistance and tolerance. In this study we investigate the evolution of several types of host disease resistance strategies, alone or in combination, in spatially structured populations. We construct a spatially explicit, individual-based stochastic model where hosts and parasites interact with each other in a spatial lattice, and interactions are restricted to a given neighbourhood of varying size. We investigate several host resistance strategies, including constitutive (expressed in all resistant hosts), induced (expressed only upon infection), and combinations thereof. We show that a costly constitutive resistance cannot reach fixation, whereas an inducible resistance strategy may become fixed in the population if the cost remains low, particularly if it impacts host recovery. We also demonstrate that mixed strategies can be maintained in the host population, and that a higher investment in a recovery-boosting inducible resistance allows for a higher investment in a constitutive response. Our simulations reveal that the spatial structure of the population impacts the selection for resistance in a complex fashion. While single strategies of resistance are generally favoured in less structured populations, mixed strategies can sometimes prevail only in highly structured environments, e.g. when combining constitutive and transmission-blocking induced responses Overall these results shed new light on the dynamics of disease resistance in a spatially-structured host-pathogen system, and advance our theoretical understanding of the evolutionary dynamics of disease resistance, a necessary step to elaborate more efficient and sustainable strategies for disease management.

AB  - Previous work with the spatial iterated prisoner's dilemma has shown that the ability to respond to a partner's defection by simply "walking away" allows so-called walk away cooperators to outcompete defectors as well as cooperators that do not respond to defection. These findings are important because they suggest a relatively simple route by which cooperation can evolve. But it remains to be seen just how robust the walk away strategy is to ecologically important variables such as population density, strategic error, and offspring dispersal. The results of our simulation experiments show that the evolutionary success of walk away cooperators decreases with decreasing population density and/or with increasing error. This relationship is best explained by the ways in which population density and error jointly affect the opportunity cost of walking away. This opportunity cost also explains why naive cooperators regularly outcompete walk away cooperators in pair-wise competition, something not observed in previous studies. Our results further show that local offspring dispersal can inhibit the evolution of cooperation by negating the protection low population density affords the most vulnerable cooperators. Our research identifies socio-ecological conditions in which forgiveness trumps flight in the spatial iterated prisoner's dilemma. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The distribution of allele frequencies obtained from diffusion approximations to Wright-Fisher models is useful in developing intuition about the population level effects of evolutionary processes. The statistical properties of the stationary distributions of K-allele models have been extensively studied under neutrality or under selection. Here, we introduce a new family of Wright-Fisher models in which there are two hierarchical levels of genetic variability. The genotypes composed of alleles differing from each other at the selected level have fitness differences with respect to each other and evolve under selection. The genotypes composed of alleles differing from each other only at the neutral level have the same fitness and evolve under neutrality. We show that with an appropriate scaling of the mutation parameter with respect to the number of alleles at each level, the frequencies of alleles at the selected and the neutral level are conditionally independent of each other, conditional on knowing the number of alleles at all levels. This conditional independence allows us to simulate from the joint stationary distribution of the allele frequencies. We use these simulated frequencies to perform inference on parameters of the model with two levels of genetic variability using Approximate Bayesian Computation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The population-scaled mutation rate, theta, is informative on the effective population size and is thus widely used in population genetics. We show that for two sequences and n unlinked loci, the variance of Tajima's estimator ((theta) over cap), which is the average number of pairwise differences, does not vanish even as n -> infinity. The non-zero variance of (theta) over cap results from a (weak) correlation between coalescence times even at unlinked loci, which, in turn, is due to the underlying fixed pedigree shared by gene genealogies at all loci. We derive the correlation coefficient under a diploid, discrete-time, Wright-Fisher model, and we also derive a simple, closed-form lower bound. We also obtain empirical estimates of the correlation of coalescence times under demographic models inspired by large-scale human genealogies. While the effect we describe is small (Var [(theta) over cap] /theta(2) approximate to O (N-e(-1))), it is important to recognize this feature of statistical population genetics, which runs counter to commonly held notions about unlinked loci.

AB  - Repeated games have a long tradition in the behavioral sciences and evolutionary biology. Recently, strategies were discovered that permit an unprecedented level of control over repeated interactions by enabling a player to unilaterally enforce linear constraints on payoffs. Here, we extend this theory of "zero-determinant" (or, more generally, "autocratic") strategies to alternating games, which are often biologically more relevant than traditional synchronous games. Alternating games naturally result in asymmetries between players because the first move matters or because players might not move with equal probabilities. In a strictly-alternating game with two players, X and Y, we give conditions for the existence of autocratic strategies for playerX when (i)X moves first and (ii) Y moves first. Furthermore, we show that autocratic strategies exist even for (iii) games with randomly-alternating moves. Particularly important categories of autocratic strategies are extortionate and generous strategies, which enforce unfavorable and favorable outcomes for the opponent, respectively. We illustrate these strategies using the continuous Donation Game, in which a player pays a cost to provide a benefit to the opponent according to a continuous cooperative investment level. Asymmetries due to alternating moves could easily arise from dominance hierarchies, and we show that they can endow subordinate players with more autocratic strategies than dominant players.

AB  - One of the serious threats facing the administration of antiretroviral therapy to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infected patients is the reported increasing prevalence of transmitted drug resistance. However, given that HIV-1 drug-resistant strains are often less fit than the wild-type strains, it is expected that drug-resistant strains that are present during the primary phase of the HIV-1 infection are replaced by the fitter wild-type strains. This replacement of HIV-1 resistant mutations involves the emergence of wild-type strains by a process of backward mutation. How quickly the replacement happens is dependent on the class of HIV-1 mutation group.
   We estimate the backward mutation rates and relative fitness of various mutational groups known to confer HIV-1 drug resistance. We do this by fitting a stochastic model to data for individuals who were originally infected by an HIV-1 strain carrying any one of the known drug resistance-conferring mutations and observed over a period of time to see whether the resistant strain is replaced. To do this, we seek a distribution, generated from simulations of the stochastic model, that best describes the observed (clinical data) replacement times of a given mutation. We found that Lamivudine/Emtricitabine-associated mutations have a distinctly higher, backward mutation rate and low relative fitness compared to the other classes (as has been reported before) while protease inhibitors-associated mutations have a slower backward mutation rate and high relative fitness. For the other mutation classes, we found more uncertainty in their estimates. (C) 2016 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - In Ait Kaci Azzou et al. (2015) we introduced an Importance Sampling (IS) approach for estimating the demographic history of a sample of DNA sequences, the skywis plot. More precisely, we proposed a new nonparametric estimate of a population size that changes over time. We showed on simulated data that the skywis plot can work well in typical situations where the effective population size does not undergo very steep changes. In this paper, we introduce an iterative procedure which extends the previous method and gives good estimates under such rapid variations. In the iterative calibrated skywis plot we approximate the effective population size by a piecewise constant function, whose values are re-estimated at each step. These piecewise constant functions are used to generate the waiting times of non homogeneous Poisson processes related to a coalescent process with mutation under a variable population size model. Moreover, the present IS procedure is based on a modified version of the Stephens and Donnelly (2000) proposal distribution. Finally, we apply the iterative calibrated skywis plot method to a simulated data set from a rapidly expanding exponential model, and we show that the method based on this new IS strategy correctly reconstructs the demographic history.

AB  - Social dilemmas are an integral part of social interactions. Cooperative actions, ranging from secreting extra-cellular products in microbial populations to donating blood in humans, are costly to the actor and hence create an incentive to shirk and avoid the costs. Nevertheless, cooperation is ubiquitous in nature. Both costs and benefits often depend non-linearly on the number and types of individuals involved as captured by idioms such as 'too many cooks spoil the broth' where additional contributions are discounted, or 'two heads are better than one' where cooperators synergistically enhance the group benefit. Interaction group sizes may depend on the size of the population and hence on ecological processes. This results in feedback mechanisms between ecological and evolutionary processes, which jointly affect and determine the evolutionary trajectory. Only recently combined eco-evolutionary processes became experimentally tractable in microbial social dilemmas. Here we analyse the evolutionary dynamics of nonlinear social dilemmas in settings where the population fluctuates in size and the environment changes over time. In particular, cooperation is often supported and maintained at high densities through ecological fluctuations. Moreover, we find that the combination of the two processes routinely reveals highly complex dynamics, which suggests common occurrence in nature. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - With the great advances in ancient DNA extraction, genetic data are now obtained from geographically separated individuals from both present and past. However, population genetics theory about the joint effect of space and time has not been thoroughly studied. Based on the classical stepping-stone model, we develop the theory of Isolation by distance and time. We derive the correlation of allele frequencies between demes in the case where ancient samples are present, and investigate the impact of edge effects with forward-in-time simulations. We also derive results about coalescent times in circular and toroidal models. As one of the most common ways to investigate population structure is principal components analysis (PCA), we evaluate the impact of our theory on PCA plots. Our results demonstrate that time between samples is an important factor. Ancient samples tend to be drawn to the center of a PCA plot. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - This study develops a quantitative framework for estimating the effects of extreme suspended-sediment events (SSC > 25 mg L-1) on virtual populations of Chinook (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and coho (O. kisutch) salmon in a coastal watershed of British Columbia, Canada. We used a life history model coupled with a dose response model to evaluate the populations' responses to a set of simulated suspended sediments scenarios. Our results indicate that a linear increase in SSC produces non-linear declining trajectories in both Chinook and coho populations, but this decline was more evident for Chinook salmon despite their shorter fresh-water residence. The model presented here can provide insights into SSC impacts on population responses of salmoriids and potentially assist resource managers when planning conservation or remediation strategies.

AB  - In a (two-type) Wright-Fisher diffusion with directional selection and two-way mutation, let x denote today's frequency of the beneficial type, and given x, let h(x) be the probability that, among all individuals of today's population, the individual whose progeny will eventually take over in the population is of the beneficial type. Fearnhead (2002) and Taylor (2007) obtained a series representation for h(x). We develop a construction that contains elements of both the ancestral selection graph and the lookdown construction and includes pruning of certain lines upon mutation. Besides being interesting in its own right, this construction allows a transparent derivation of the series coefficients of h(x) and gives them a probabilistic meaning. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - A selective explanation for the evolution of multicellular organisms from unicellular ones requires knowledge of both selective pressures and factors affecting the response to selection. Understanding the response to selection is particularly challenging in the case of evolutionary transitions in individuality, because these transitions involve a shift in the very units of selection. We develop a conceptual framework in which three fundamental processes (growth, division, and splitting) are the scaffold for unicellular and multicellular life cycles alike. We (i) enumerate the possible ways in which these processes can be linked to create more complex life cycles, (ii) introduce three genes based on growth, division and splitting that, acting in concert, determine the architecture of the life cycles, and finally, (iii) study the evolution of the simplest five life cycles using a heuristic model of coupled ordinary differential equations in which mutations are allowed in the three genes. We demonstrate how changes in the regulation of three fundamental aspects of colonial form (cell size, colony size, and colony cell number) could lead unicellular life cycles to evolve into primitive multicellular life cycles with group properties. One interesting prediction of the model is that selection generally favors cycles with group level properties when intermediate body size is associated with lowest mortality. That is, a universal requirement for the evolution of group cycles in the model is that the size-mortality curve be U-shaped. Furthermore, growth must decelerate with size. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The distribution of allele frequencies of a large number of biallelic sites is known as "allele-frequency spectrum" or "site-frequency spectrum" (SFS). Without selection and in regions of relatively high recombination rates, sites may be assumed to be independently and identically distributed. With a beta equilibrium distribution of allelic proportions and binomial sampling, a beta-binomial compound likelihood for each site results. The likelihood of the data and the posterior distribution of two parameters, scaled mutation rate theta and mutation bias alpha, is investigated in the general case and for small scaled mutation rates theta. In the general case, an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is derived to obtain maximum likelihood estimates of both parameters. With an appropriate prior distribution, a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler to integrate the posterior distribution is also derived. As far as I am aware, previous maximum likelihood or Bayesian estimators of theta, explicitly or implicitly assume small scaled mutation rates, i.e., theta << 1. For theta << 1, maximum-likelihood estimators are also derived for both parameters using a Taylor series expansion of the beta-binomial distribution. The estimator of theta is a variant of the Ewens-Watterson estimator and of the maximum likelihood estimator derived with the Poisson Random Field approach. With a conjugate prior distribution, marginal and conditional beta posterior distributions are also derived for both parameters. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - F-ST is one of the most frequently-used indices of genetic differentiation among groups. Though F-ST takes values between 0 and 1, authors going back to Wright have noted that under many circumstances, F-ST is constrained to be less than 1. Recently, we showed that at a genetic locus with an unspecified number of alleles, F-ST for two subpopulations is strictly bounded from above by functions of both the frequency of the most frequent allele (M) and the homozygosity of the total population (H-T). In the two-subpopulation case, F-ST can equal one only when the frequency of the most frequent allele and the total homozygosity are 1/2. Here, we extend this work by deriving strict bounds on F-ST for two subpopulations when the number of alleles at the locus is specified to be I. We show that restricting to I alleles produces the same upper bound on F-ST over much of the allowable domain for M and H-T, and we derive more restrictive bounds in the windows M is an element of[1/I, 1/(I - 1)) and H-T is an element of [1/I, I/(I-2 - 1)). These results extend our understanding of the behavior of F-ST in relation to other population-genetic statistics. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - In spatially structured populations, global panmixia can be viewed as the limiting case of long-distance migration. The effect of incorporating partial panmixia into diallelic single-locus dines maintained by migration and selection with complete dominance in an unbounded unidimensional habitat is investigated. The population density is uniform. Migration and selection are both weak; the former is homogeneous and symmetric; the latter is frequency independent. The spatial factor (g) over tilde (x) in the selection term, where x denotes position, is a single step at the origin: (g) over tilde (x) = -alpha < 0 if x < 0, and (g) over tilde (x) = 1 if x > 0. If alpha = I, there exists a globally asymptotically stable dine. For alpha < 1, such a cline exists if and only if the scaled panmictic rate p is less than the critical value /beta** = 2 alpha/(1-alpha). For alpha > 1, a unique, asymptotically stable dine exists if and only if beta is less than the critical value beta*; then a smaller, unique, unstable equilibrium also exists whenever beta < beta*. Two coupled, nonlinear polynomial equations uniquely determine beta*. Explicit solutions are derived for each of the above equilibria. If beta > 0 and a dine exists, some polymorphism is maintained even at x = +/-infinity. Both the preceding result and the existence of an unstable equilibrium when alpha > 1 and 0 < beta < beta* differ qualitatively from the classical case (beta = 0). (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Explaining the coexistence of multiple species in the competition and predation theatre has proven a great challenge. Traditional intraguild predation (IGP) models have only relatively small regions of stable coexistence of all species. Here, we investigate potential additional mechanisms that extend these regions of stable coexistence. We used a 3-species Lotka-Volterra system to which we added an interaction term to model a unidirectional facilitative relationship between the two predators in the IGP. In this modelling study the IG predator was able to precondition a part of the common resource by an instantaneous manipulation, which resulted in the immobilization of the resource species. This mechanism of immobilization facilitated the resource uptake by the IG prey and thus increased its growth rates even in the presence of the common predator. The facilitative relationship of the IG prey by the IG predator produced a stable coexistence of both predators even though the IG prey was an inferior competitor for a common resource, which cannot be attained with the traditional IGP models. Furthermore, our model predicted a 3-species stable coexistence even at high enrichment where no coexistence was found in the basic IGP model. Thus, we showed that diversity of resource traits could significantly alter emergent community patterns via shifts in exploitative competition of IGP-related predators. The described mechanism could potentially lead to a higher efficiency in exploitation of common resources and thus promote higher diversity in a real community. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Using the abrupt decline in sex ratio at birth in China during and immediately after the 1959-1961 treat Leap Forward Famine in China as a natural experiment, this study conducts difference-in-differences analysis to test the hypothesis that changes in the sex ratio at birth of the maternal generation can produce adaptive changes in the sex ratio at birth of the offspring generation toward the opposite direction, which was derived from the developmental and evolutionary psychological literature on female reproductive strategy. The results show that, after controlling for sex-selective abortion, the decline in the sex ratio at birth in 1962-1964 caused a substantial increase in the sex ratio at birth among children whose mothers were born in 1963. Such finding suggests the presence of adaptive intergenerational sex ratio adjustment in humans. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The theoretical literature from 1985 to the present on the evolution of learning strategies in variable environments is reviewed, with the focus on deterministic dynamical models that are amenable to local stability analysis, and on deterministic models yielding evolutionarily stable strategies. Individual learning, unbiased and biased social learning, mixed learning, and learning schedules are considered. A rapidly changing environment or frequent migration in a spatially heterogeneous environment favors individual learning over unbiased social learning. However, results are not so straightforward in the context of learning schedules or when biases in social learning are introduced. The three major methods of modeling temporal environmental change coevolutionary, two-timescale, and information decay are compared and shown to sometimes yield contradictory results. The so-called Rogers' paradox is inherent in the two-timescale method as originally applied to the evolution of pure strategies, but is often eliminated when the other methods are used. Moreover, Rogers' paradox is not observed for the mixed learning strategies and learning schedules that we review.

AB  - Epidemiological models have been applied to human health-related behaviors that are affected by social interaction. Typically these models have not considered conformity bias, that is, the exaggerated propensity to adopt commonly observed behaviors or opinions, or content biases, where the content of the learned trait affects the probability of adoption. Here we consider an interaction of these two effects, presenting an SIS-type model for the spread and persistence of a behavior which is transmitted via social learning. Uptake is controlled by a nonlinear dependence on the proportion of individuals demonstrating the behavior in a population. Three equilibrium solutions are found, their linear stability is analyzed and the results are compared with a model for unbiased social learning. Our analysis focuses on the effects of the strength of conformity bias and the effects of content biases which alter a conformity threshold frequency of the behavior, above which there is an exaggerated propensity for adoption. The strength of the conformity bias is found to qualitatively alter the predictions regarding whether the trait becomes endemic within the population and the proportion of individuals who display the trait when it is endemic. As the conformity strength increases, the number of feasible equilibrium solutions increases from two to three, leading to a situation where the stable equilibrium attained is dependent upon the initial state. Varying the conformity threshold frequency directionally alters the behavior invasion threshold. Finally we discuss the possible application of this model to binge drinking behavior.

AB  - In this paper we investigate the spatial dynamics of a deterministic model describing two host species that partially share a common spatial domain, experiencing apparent competition mediated by macroparasites. The aim of this work is to understand the mechanisms underlying apparent competition processes in a spatially structured environment, which have been generally overlooked up to now.
   First, we analyse the behaviour of a single-host macroparasite partial differential equation (PDE) model, both in the cases of uniform or spatially-dependent vital rates of the host, focusing on the role of spatial diffusion on parasite persistence and host abundance. We obtained the threshold condition for parasite persistence, and (in contrast to what occurs in reaction-diffusion models for an isolated population) we found that, in the case of spatially-dependent vital rates, increasing the host diffusion coefficient results in an increase of the overall host population.
   Then, a PDE model featuring spatial diffusion and apparent competition mediated via shared macroparasites between two species is analysed in order to understand the role of spatial heterogeneity in host coexistence. We assumed a partial overlap among the habitats of the two species and found that the shared parasites could cause, depending on the values of the diffusion coefficients and differences in induced mortality among host species, a decrease of the realized habitat and, eventually, the extinction of the species less tolerant to parasite infection. This shows that the presence of regulating parasites complicates the effect of dispersal on population dynamics and that the dynamics of apparent competition cannot be adequately understood from spatially-independent models.

AB  - We study sexual populations structured by a phenotypic trait and a space variable, in a non-homogeneous environment. Departing from an infinitesimal model, we perform an asymptotic limit to derive the system introduced in Kirkpatrick and Barton (1997). We then perform a further simplification to obtain a simple model. Thanks to this simpler equation, we can describe rigorously the dynamics of the population. In particular, we provide an explicit estimate of the invasion speed, or extinction speed of the species. Numerical computations show that this simple model provides a good approximation of the original infinitesimal model, and in particular describes quite well the evolution of the species' range.
