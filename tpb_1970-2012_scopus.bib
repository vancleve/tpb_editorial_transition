	abstract = {Previous research into the neutral theory of biodiversity has focused mainly on equilibrium solutions rather than time-dependent solutions. Understanding the time-dependent solutions is essential for applying neutral theory to ecosystems in which time-dependent processes, such as succession and invasion, are driving the dynamics. Time-dependent solutions also facilitate tests against data that are stronger than those based on static equilibrium patterns. Here I investigate the time-dependent solutions of the classic spatially implicit neutral model, in which a small local community is coupled to a much larger metacommunity through immigration. I present explicit general formulas for the eigenvalues, left eigenvectors and right eigenvectors of the models's transition matrix. The time-dependent solutions can then be expressed in terms of these eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Some of these results are translated directly from existing results for the classic Moran model of population genetics (the Moran model is equivalent to the spatially implicit neutral model after a reparameterization); others of the results are new. I demonstrate that the asymptotic time-dependent solution corresponding to just these first two eigenvectors can be a good approximation to the full time-dependent solution. I also demonstrate the feasibility of a partial eigendecomposition of the transition matrix, which facilitates direct application of the results to a biologically relevant example in which a newly invading species is initially present in the metacommunity but absent from the local community. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {The phenomenon of group escape cannot be explained by an argument of risk dilution, applied to gregarious behaviour of passive prey whose risk of predation is equally shared by all group members (Hamilton, 1971). Instead, individuals at the tail of an escaping group suffer the bulk of the group's predation risk, and thus have the highest incentive to desert it. Just because of this, desertion, in this case, may serve as a signal of vulnerability for the pursuing predator. Under wide conditions, it is therefore shown that the predator is always expected to prefer the chasing of a deserter, whenever it is observed. Consequently, an individual who finds himself at the tail of the herd must compare the risk of remaining there with that of deserting the herd and thereby becoming a likely target for predation. If the first risk is higher than the latter, the herd disperses; if the latter is higher, the herd cohesively follows the fastest individuals in its lead (we deal also with cases in which only part of the herd disperses). We see, however, that the question which risk is higher depends not only on the terrain, but also on the route of escape that is decided by the fastest members at the lead of the herd, those that are least likely to be caught. Concentrating on herds without family structure, we assume that the route of escape is selfishly chosen by these ad hoc leaders to minimize their own predation risk, regardless of the others' welfare. However, the predation risk of the leader depends very much on the willingness of other herd members to follow him, thus providing a buffer between him and the pursuing predator. Consequently, when choosing an escape route, the leader has also to consider the cohesion of the herd, i.e., the reaction of slower individuals to his choice. Under some plausible conditions, this choice may force the herd to follow, while other conditions may lead to its dispersal. In some cases the leader may choose a route that serves the needs of the entire group, and sometime only those of its more vulnerable members. In other cases the leader may choose a route that sacrifices the weakest members, thereby improving the survival probability of the others. We employ a model of a k+1 players game, a single predator, and k heterogeneous prey individuals. The predator aims to maximize the probability of a successful catch, and each individual aims to minimize his probability of being caught. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Sex-biased dispersal occurs in all seed plants and many animal species. Theoretical models have shown that sex-biased dispersal can lead to evolutionarily stable biased sex ratios. Here, we use a spatially explicit chessboard model to simulate the evolution of sex ratio in response to sex-biased dispersal range and sex-biased dispersal rate. Two life cycles are represented in the model: one in which both sexes disperse before mating (DDM), the other in which males disperse before mating and mated females or zygotes disperse after mating (DMD). Model parameters include factors like dispersal rate, dispersal range, number of individuals per patch, and habitat heterogeneity. When dispersal range is sex biased, we find that, in a homogeneous environment, the sex ratio is generally biased towards the sex that disperses more widely (sex ratio range: 0.47-0.52). In a heterogeneous environment, the sex ratio is generally biased towards the more dispersive sex in good habitats, and towards the less dispersive sex in poor habitats (sex ratio range: 0-1). This is opposite to the effect of sex-biased dispersal rate, which favours the production of the more dispersive sex in poor habitats and the less dispersive sex in good habitats (sex ratio range: 0-1). To allow for a comparison with theoretical predictions, data concerning sex-biased dispersal and habitat-dependent sex ratios should thus incorporate information about the spatial scale of both dispersal and environmental heterogeneity. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

The optimal choice between using individual learning and/or social learning may be dictated by the life-stage or age of an organism. Of special interest is a learning schedule in which social learning precedes individual learning, because such a schedule is apparently a necessary condition for cumulative culture. Assuming two obligatory learning stages per discrete generation, we obtain the evolutionarily stable learning schedules for the three situations where the environment is constant, fluctuates between generations, or fluctuates within generations. During each learning stage, we assume that an organism may target the optimal phenotype in the current environment by individual learning, and/or the mature phenotype of the previous generation by oblique social learning. In the absence of exogenous costs to learning, the evolutionarily stable learning schedules are predicted to be either pure social learning followed by pure individual learning ("bang-bang" control) or pure individual learning at both stages ("flat" control). Moreover, we find for each situation that the evolutionarily stable learning schedule is also the one that optimizes the learned phenotype at equilibrium. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {The allele frequency spectrum is a series of statistics that describe genetic polymorphism, and is commonly used for inferring population genetic parameters and detecting natural selection. Population genetic theory on the allele frequency spectrum for a single population has been well studied using both coalescent theory and diffusion equations. Recently, the theory was extended to the joint allele frequency spectrum (JAFS) for three populations using diffusion equations and was shown to be very useful in inferring human demographic history. In this paper, I show that the JAFS can be analytically derived with coalescent theory for a basic model of two isolated populations and then extended to multiple populations and various complex scenarios, such as those involving population growth and bottleneck, migration, and positive selection. Simulation study is used to demonstrate the accuracy and applicability of the theoretical model. The coalescent theory-based approach for the JAFS can characterize the demographic history with comprehensive statistical models as the diffusion approach does, and in addition gains several novel advantages: the computational complexity of calculating the JAFS with coalescent theory is reduced, and thus it is feasible to analytically obtain the JAFS for multiple populations; the hitchhiking effect can be efficiently modeled in coalescent theory, enabling the development of methodologies for detecting selection via multi-population polymorphism data. As an alternative to the diffusion approximation approach, the coalescent theory for the JAFS also provides a foundation for population genetic inference with the advent of large-scale genomic polymorphism data. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

These terms describe unbiological processes which can be systematically removed up to and including the nth order by nth order moment closure approximations. These terms lead to a detailed understanding of the correlations in network-based epidemic models and contribute to understanding the connection between individual-level epidemic processes and population-level models. The connection with metapopulation models is also discussed.

The body condition of clonally produced offspring varies within and between families. Offspring compete for patches in a weighted lottery, and dispersal is driven by kin competition. Survival during dispersal may depend on body condition, and competitive ability increases with increasing body condition. The evolutionarily stable strategy predicts that families abandon patches which are too unsafe or do not produce enough successful dispersers. From families that invest in retaining their natal patches, individuals stay in the patch that are less suitable for dispersal whereas the better dispersers disperse. However, this clear within-family pattern is often not reflected in the population-wide body condition distribution of dispersers or non-dispersers. This may be an explanation why empirical data do not show any general relationship between body condition and dispersal. When all individuals are equally good dispersers, then there exist equivalence classes defined by the competitive weight that remains in a patch. An equivalence class consists of infinitely many dispersal strategies that are selectively neutral. This provides an explanation why very diverse patterns found in body condition dependent dispersal data can all be equally evolutionarily stable. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

Because of this weakness, success bias fails to replace unbiased imitation in an evolutionary model when selection is fairly weak or when the environment is relatively stable, and sometimes fails to invade at all. I briefly discuss the optimal strength of success bias, the complicated nature of defining success in social learning contexts, and the value of variant frequency as an important source of information to social learners.

Under a structural prior with this property, the marginal prior distribution of the local properties of a pedigree node (number of parents, offspring, etc.) does not depend on the number of nodes in the pedigree. Such priors are found to arise naturally by an application of the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle, under which construction of a prior becomes equivalent to the problem of determining the length of a code required to encode a pedigree, using the principles of information theory.

	abstract = {Probabilities of monophyly, paraphyly, and polyphyly of two-species gene genealogies are computed for modest sample sizes and compared for two different Λ coalescent processes. Coalescent processes belonging to the Λ coalescent family admit asynchronous multiple mergers of active ancestral lineages. Assigning a timescale to the time of divergence becomes a central issue when different populations have different coalescent processes running on different timescales. Clade probabilities in single populations are also computed, which can be useful for testing for taxonomic distinctiveness of an observed set of monophyletic lineages. The coalescence rates of multiple merger coalescent processes are functions of coalescent parameters. The effect of coalescent parameters on the probabilities studied depends on the coalescent process, and if the population is ancestral or derived. The probability of reciprocal monophyly tends to be somewhat lower, when associated with a Λ coalescent, under the null hypothesis that two groups come from the same population. However, even for fairly recent divergence times, the probability of monophyly tends to be higher as a function of the number of generations for coalescent processes that admit multiple mergers, and is sensitive to the parameter of one of the example processes. © 2012 Elsevier Inc..},

This generates predictions for diet choice, coexistence, and community structure of heterotroph communities. Tradeoffs in consumer resource-garnering traits influence community outcomes. With scarce resources, consumers forage opportunistically for complementary resources and may coexist via tradeoffs in resource encounter rates. In contrast to single currency models, stoichiometry permits multiple equilibria. These alternative stable states occur when tradeoffs in resource encounter rates are stronger than tradeoffs in elemental conversion efficiencies. With abundant resources consumers exhibit partially selective diets for essential resources and may coexist via tradeoffs in elemental conversion efficiencies. These results differ from single currency models, where adaptive diet selection is either opportunistic or selective. Interestingly, communities composed of efficient consumers share many of the same properties as communities based on substitutable resources. However, communities composed of relatively inefficient consumers behave similarly to plant communities as characterized by Tilman's consumer resource theory. The results of our model indicate that the effects of stoichiometry theory on community ecology are dependent upon both consumer foraging behavior and the nature of resource garnering tradeoffs. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

Recent theoretical studies of coevolving predator-prey systems have concentrated more on the stability of such systems than on the characteristics of cycles when they are unstable. Here I explore the characteristics of the cycles that arise due to coevolution in a system in which prey can increase their ability to escape from predators by becoming either significantly larger or significantly smaller in trait value (i.e.,a bidirectional trait axis). This is a reasonable model of body size evolution in some systems. The results show that antiphase population cycles and cryptic cycles (large population fluctuation in one species but almost no change in another species) can occur in the coevolutionary system but not systems where only a single species evolves. Previously, those dynamical patterns have only been theoretically shown to occur in single species evolutionary models and the coevolutionary model which do not involve a bi-directional axis of adaptation. These unusual dynamics may be observed in predator-prey interactions when the density dependence in the prey species is strong. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

In turn, the suite of varying individual infection histories will shape the population level dynamics of the disease. Exploring the consequences of precisely how immunity is acquired using mathematical models has proven challenging though: if n strains have circulated previously, there are 2n combinations of past infection to consider. However, by using an age-structured mathematical model of a disease with multiple strains, we can examine the population immune profile without explicitly keeping track of all possible infection histories. This framework allows previously unknown consequences of assumptions about immune acquisition to be observed. In particular, we see that 'original antigenic sin' can reduce immunity in some age groups: these immune blind spots could be responsible for the unexpectedly high severity of certain past influenza epidemics. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

Contrary to earlier models, these two attractors can exist also simultaneously. I investigate the robustness of the model by including delayed flowering, a common phenomenon in plants, and provide a full numerical bifurcation analysis of the generalized model. High fecundity implies strong competition within year classes and promotes coexistence, whereas high survival results in strong competition between year classes and promotes competitive exclusion. Delayed flowering tends to stabilize the interior equilibrium, but (unlike in density-independent matrix models) the population cycles are robust with respect to some delay in flowering. © 2012 Elsevier Inc..},

	abstract = {To maintain biodiversity conservation areas, we need to invest in activities, such as monitoring the condition of the ecosystem, preventing illegal exploitation, and removing harmful alien species. These require a constant supply of resources, the level of which is determined by the concern of the society about biodiversity conservation. In this paper, we study the optimal fraction of the resources to invest in activities for enhancing the social concern y(t) by environmental education, museum displays, publications, and media exposure. We search for the strategy that maximizes the time-integral of the quality of the conservation area x(t) with temporal discounting. Analyses based on dynamic programming and Pontryagin's maximum principle show that the optimal control consists of two phases: (1) in the first phase, the social concern level approaches to the final optimal value y*, (2) in the second phase, resources are allocated to both activities, and the social concern level is kept constant y(t)=y*. If the social concern starts from a low initial level, the optimal path includes a period in which the quality of the conservation area declines temporarily, because all the resources are invested to enhance the social concern. When the support rate increases with the quality of the conservation area itself x(t) as well as with the level of social concern y(t), both variables may increase simultaneously in the second phase. We discuss the implication of the results to good management of biodiversity conservation areas. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

Numerical simulations and bifurcation analysis are used to examine the impact of energy enrichment under nutrient and stoichiometric constraints.

The effect of incorporating partial panmixia into diallelic single-locus clines maintained by migration and selection in an unbounded unidimensional habitat is investigated. Migration and selection are both weak. The former is homogenous and isotropic; the latter has no dominance. The population density is uniform. A simple, explicit formula is derived for the maximum value β0 of the scaled panmictic rate β for which a cline exists. The former depends only on the asymptotic values of the scaled selection coefficient. If the two alleles have the same average selection coefficient, there exists a unique, globally asymptotically stable cline for every β≥0. Otherwise, if β≥β0, the allele with the greater average selection coefficient is ultimately fixed. If β<β0, there exists a unique, globally asymptotically stable cline, and some polymorphism is retained even infinitely far from its center. The gene frequencies at infinity are determined by a continuous-time, two-deme migration-selection model. An explicit expression is deduced for the monotone cline in a step-environment. These results differ fundamentally from those for the classical cline without panmixia. © 2012 Elsevier Inc..},

To improve this promising mechanism, here we propose an extended Public Goods game with rare but severe concerted punishment, in which once a defector is caught punishment is triggered and the cost of punishment is equally shared among the remainder of the group. Analytical results show that, when the probability for concerted punishment is above a threshold, cooperating is, while defecting is not, an evolutionarily stable strategy in finite populations, and that this way of punishment can considerably decrease the total cost of inhibiting defection, especially in large populations. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

We explored the effects of random movement strategies on the evolution of cooperation using an agent-based prisoner's dilemma model with mobile agents. This is the first systematic analysis of a model in which cooperators and defectors can use different random movement strategies, which we chose to fall on a spectrum between highly exploratory and highly restricted in their search tendencies. Because limited dispersal and restrictions to local neighborhood size are known to influence the ability of cooperators to effectively assort, we also assessed the robustness of our findings with respect to dispersal and local capacity constraints. We show that differences in patterns of movement can dramatically influence the likelihood of cooperator success, and that the effects of different movement patterns are sensitive to environmental assumptions about offspring dispersal and local space constraints. Since local interactions implicitly generate dynamic social interaction networks, we also measured the average number of unique and total interactions over a lifetime and considered how these emergent network dynamics helped explain the results. This work extends what is known about mobility and the evolution of cooperation, and also has general implications for social models with randomly moving agents. © 2012 Elsevier Inc..},

The following two cases are investigated. The first is the case in which the resource competed for and its competition type change depending on life stages from scramble to contest competition, or from contest to scramble competition. The second is the case in which individuals compete for two resources simultaneously with scramble and contest types, respectively. In both cases, population models are derived analytically, and in particular, the Hassell model is derived in the second case. The nature of reproduction curves and the stability properties of three population models derived are compared with each other.

Barriers to neutral gene flow are expected to increase with linkage to targets of local selection and with differences between demes in the frequencies of locally adapted alleles. This expectation is borne out under purifying and disruptive selection, regimes that promote monomorphism within demes. In contrast, overdominance within demes induces minimal barriers to neutral introgression even in the face of very large differences between demes in the frequencies of locally adapted alleles. Further, segregation distortion, a phenomenon observed in a number of interspecific hybrids, can in fact promote transmission by migrants to future generations at rates exceeding those of residents. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

It is well known that for the two-allele model there are only three existing patterns, depending on the relative fitness between the homozygotes and the heterozygote. For the three-allele model there are 14 existing patterns, and we shall show in this paper that for the four-allele model there are 117 existing patterns. We also describe the domains of attraction for coexisting asymptotically stable equilibria. The problem of finding existing patterns has been studied in the past, and it is an important problem because the results can be used to predict the long-term genetic makeup of a population. It should be pointed out that this continuous-time model is only an approximation to the corresponding discrete-time model.

Orphans suffer higher mortality than non-orphans, which simulates the need for daughters to receive maternal care in order to survive. The way that maternal care affects population dynamics and life-history evolution is then analysed for demographic regimes that encompass large ranges of daughter survival, mother survival and fertility. We provide stable age-distributions of orphans and non-orphans for each regime and perform sensitivity analyses on daughter survival, adult survival and fertility. The results show that natural selection will favour (i) faster daughter independence from maternal care, (ii) higher adult survival at all ages, and (iii)early reproduction to the detriment of late reproduction. We then build scenarios concerning the coevolution of daughter survival and maternal care with adult survival and fertility. We also incorporate grandmaternal care into the model. We show that (i) the acute altriciality of human babies, (ii) the increased maternal care resulting from emergence of complex sociality and (iii)the role played by grandmothers in caring for granddaughters may have led to the emergence of specific human life-history traits: a short reproductive period characterised by a reproductive senescence and menopause, as well as an extended lifespan characterised by a post-reproductive life. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

It is currently of particular concern as a possible mechanism for the spread of modified crop genes to wild populations. The hazard rate is the probability per time unit that such an escape takes place, given that it has not happened before. It is a quantitative measure of introgression risk that takes the stochastic elements inherent in introgression processes into account. We present a methodology to calculate the hazard rate for situations with time-varying gene flow from a crop to a large recipient wild population. As an illustration, several types of time-inhomogeneity are examined, including deterministic periodicity as well as random variation. Furthermore, we examine the effects of an extended fitness bottleneck of hybrids and backcrosses in combination with time-varying gene flow. It is found that bottlenecks decrease the hazard rate, but also slow down and delay its changes in reaction to changes in gene flow. Furthermore, we find that random variation in gene flow generates a lower hazard rate than analogous deterministic variation. We discuss the implications of our findings for crop management and introgression risk assessment. © 2012 A. Ghosh.},

Using these results, we study the behavior of several measures related to Wright's FST, including Slatkin's RST. Our analytical approximations for FST and RST show that familiar relationships between Nem and FST or RST hold when the migration and mutation rates are small. Using the exact expressions for FST and RST, our numerical results show that, when the migration and mutation rates are large, these relationships no longer hold. Our numerical results also show that the diversity measures most closely related to FST depend on mutation rates, mutational models (stepwise versus two-phase), migration rates, and population sizes. Surprisingly, RST is relatively insensitive to the mutation rates and mutational models. The differing behaviors of RST and FST suggest that properties of the among-population distribution of allele frequencies may allow the roles of mutation and migration in producing patterns of diversity to be distinguished, a topic of continuing investigation. © 2011.},

	abstract = {Periodic matrix models are frequently used to describe cyclic temporal variation (seasonal or interannual) and to account for the operation of multiple processes (e.g., demography and dispersal) within a single projection interval. In either case, the models take the form of periodic matrix products. The perturbation analysis of periodic models must trace the effects of parameter changes, at each phase of the cycle, on output variables that are calculated over the entire cycle. Here, we apply matrix calculus to obtain the sensitivity and elasticity of scalar-, vector-, or matrix-valued output variables. We apply the method to linear models for periodic environments (including seasonal harvest models), to vec-permutation models in which individuals are classified by multiple criteria, and to nonlinear models including both immediate and delayed density dependence. The results can be used to evaluate management strategies and to study selection gradients in periodic environments. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {In the absence of selection, the structure of equilibrium allelic diversity is described by the elegant sampling formula of Ewens. This formula has helped to shape our expectations of empirical patterns of molecular variation. Along with coalescent theory, it provides statistical techniques for rejecting the null model of neutrality. However, we still do not fully understand the statistics of the allelic diversity expected in the presence of natural selection. Earlier work has described the effects of strongly deleterious mutations linked to many neutral sites, and allelic variation in models where offspring fitness is unrelated to parental fitness, but it has proven difficult to understand allelic diversity in the presence of purifying selection at many linked sites. Here, we study the population genetics of infinitely many perfectly linked sites, some neutral and some deleterious. Our approach is based on studying the lineage structure within each class of individuals of similar fitness in the deleterious mutation-selection balance. Consistent with previous observations, we find that for moderate and weak selection pressures, the patterns of allelic diversity cannot be described by a neutral model for any choice of the effective population site. We compute precisely how purifying selection at many linked sites distorts the patterns of allelic diversity, by developing expressions for the likelihood of any configuration of allelic types in a sample analogous to the Ewens sampling formula. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

In particular competition for a growth-limiting resource and the dynamics of that resource in the environment modify the tradeoff between different effects of variability. Here we investigate theoretically a model system for variable populations under competition for a flowing resource that governs growth (chemostat model) and changes with time. This environment generally induces density-dependent selection among competing sub-populations. We characterize quantitatively the transient dynamics in this system, and find that equilibration between total population density and environment can occur separately and with a distinct timescale from equilibration between competing sub-populations. We analyze quantitatively the two opposing effects of heterogeneity-transient response to change, and fitness at equilibrium-and find the optimal strategy in a fluctuating environment. We characterize the phase diagram of the system in term of its optimal strategy and find it to be strongly dependent on the typical timescale of the environment and weakly dependent on the internal parameters of the population. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

This is done using the Ancestral Recombination-Selection Graph (ARSG) in a finite population in the limit of a large population size, which is also known as the Ancestral Influence Graph (AIG). An analytical expansion of the fixation probability with respect to population-scaled recombination rates and selection intensities is obtained. The coefficients of the expansion are expressed in terms of the initial state of the population and the epistatic interactions among the selected loci. Under the assumption of weak selection at tightly linked loci, the sign of the leading term, which depends on the signs of epistasis and initial linkage disequilibrium, determines whether an increase in recombination rates increases the chance of ultimate fixation of the new mutant. If mutants are advantageous, this is the case when epistasis is positive or null and the initial linkage disequilibrium is negative, which is an expected state in a finite population under directional selection. Moreover, this is also the case for a neutral mutant modifier coding for higher recombination rates if the same conditions hold at the selected loci. Under the same conditions, deleterious mutants are disfavored for ultimate fixation and neutral modifiers for higher recombination rates still favored. The recombination rates between the modifier locus and the selected loci do not come into play in the leading terms of the approximation for the fixation probability, but they do in higher-order terms. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

We also put forth an even simpler model, where all mutations originate from monomorphic states. Using this model we derive the sojourn times, conditional on the ancestral and fixed allele, and under equilibrium the distributions of fixed and polymorphic alleles and fixation rates. Furthermore, we also derive the distribution of small samples in the diffusion limit and provide convenient recurrence relations for calculating this distribution. This enables us to give formulas analogous to the Ewens-Watterson estimator of θ for biased mutation rates and selection.

	abstract = {The development of stochastic demography has largely been based on age structured populations, although other types of demographic structure, especially permanent and dynamic heterogeneity, are likely common in natural populations. The combination of stochasticity and demographic structure is a challenge for analyses of population dynamics and extinction risk, because the population structure will fluctuate around the stable structure and the population size shows transient fluctuations. However, by using a diffusion approximation for the total reproductive value, density-independent dynamics of structured populations can be described with only three population parameters: the expected population growth rate, the environmental variance and the demographic variance. These parameters depend on population structure via the state-specific vital rates and transition rates. Once they are found, the diffusion approximation represents a substantial reduction in model complexity.Here, we review and compare the key population parameters across a wide range of demographic structure, from the case of no structure to the most general case of dynamic heterogeneity, and for both discrete and continuous types. We focus on the demographic variance, but also show how environmental stochasticity can be included. This study brings together results from recent models, each considering a specific type of population structure, and places them in a general framework for structured populations. Comparison across different types of demographic structure reveals that the reproductive value is an essential concept for understanding how population structure affects stochastic dynamics and extinction risk. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {This paper is concerned with a model of "isolation with an initial period of migration", where a panmictic ancestral population split into n descendant populations which exchanged migrants symmetrically at a constant rate for a period of time and subsequently became completely isolated. In the limit as the population split occurred an infinitely long time ago, the model becomes an "isolation after migration" model, describing completely isolated descendant populations which arose from a subdivided ancestral population. The probability density function of the coalescence time of a pair of genes and the probability distribution of the number of pairwise nucleotide differences are derived for both models. Whilst these are theoretical results of interest in their own right, they also give an exact analytical expression for the likelihood, for data consisting of the numbers of nucleotide differences between pairs of DNA sequences where each pair is at a different, independent locus. The behaviour of the distribution of the number of pairwise nucleotide differences under these models is illustrated and compared to the corresponding distributions under the "isolation with migration" and "complete isolation" models. It is shown that the distribution of the number of nucleotide differences between a pair of DNA sequences from different descendant populations in the model of "isolation with an initial period of migration" can be quite different from that under the "isolation with migration model", even if the average migration rate over time (and hence the total number of migrants) is the same in both scenarios. It is also illustrated how the results can be extended to other demographic scenarios that can be described by a combination of isolated panmictic populations and "symmetric island" models. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

Predictions from such "static" models may only be of partial relevance to the evolution of advanced individual learning in modern humans, because modern humans have experienced rapid population growth and range expansion during "out-of-Africa." Here we model the spatial population dynamics of individual and social learners by a reaction-diffusion system. One feature of our model is the inclusion of the possibility that social learners may fail to find an exemplar to copy in regions where the population density is low. Due to this attenuation effect, the invasion speed of social learners is diminished, and various kinds of invasion dynamics are observed. Our primary findings are: (1) individual learners can persist indefinitely when invading environmentally homogeneous infinite space; (2) the occurrence of individual learners at the front may inhibit the spread of social learners. These results suggest that "out-of-Africa" may have driven the evolution of advanced individual learning ability in modern humans. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

For the case in which four alleles are sampled, two from each population, we condition on the configuration in which three distinct allele sizes are present, one of which is common to both populations, one of which is private to one population, and the third of which is private to the other population. Conditional on this configuration, we calculate the probability that the two private alleles occupy the two tails of the size distribution. This probability, which increases as a function of mutation rate and divergence time between the two populations, is seen to be greater than the value that would be predicted if there was no relationship between privacy and location in the allele size distribution. In accordance with the prediction of the model, we find that in pairs of human populations, the frequency with which private microsatellite alleles occur in the tails of the allele size distribution increases as a function of genetic differentiation between populations. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

In the infinite population limit, the stochastic dynamics yields a system of deterministic evolution equations for population densities; and for very large but finite systems a diffusion process is obtained. We report the emergence of a circular dynamics in the diffusion process, with an intrinsic frequency, near the endemic steady state.

	abstract = {Covariation between vital rates is recognized as an important pattern to be accounted for in demographic modeling. We recently introduced a model for estimating vital rates and their covariation as a function of known and unknown effects, using generalized linear mixed models (GLMM's) implemented in a hierarchical Bayesian framework (Evans etal., 2010) In particular, this model included a model-wide year effect (YEAR) influencing all vital rates, which we used to estimate covariation between vital rates due to exogenous factors not directly included in the model. This YEAR effect connected the GLMMs of vital rates into one large model; we refer to this as the "connected GLMMs" approach. Here we used a simulation study to evaluate the performance of a simplified version of this model, compared to separate GLMMs of vital rates, in terms of their ability to estimate correlations between vital rates. We simulated data from known relationships between vital rates and a covariate, inducing correlations among the vital rates. We then estimated those correlations from the simulated data using connected vs. separate GLMMs with year random effects. We compared precision and accuracy of estimated vital rates and their correlations under three scenarios of the pervasiveness of the exogenous effect (and thus true correlations). The two approaches provide equally good point estimates of vital rate parameters, but connected GLMMs provide better estimates of covariation between vital rates than separate GLMMs, both in terms of accuracy and precision, when the common influence on vital rates is pervasive. We discuss the situations where connected GLMMs might be best used, as well as further areas of investigation for this approach. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

The maximal number of equilibria and their classification based on stability have been the primary subjects of these studies, for example in the context of two-player games with multiple strategies. Herein, we address a different question using evolutionary game theory as a tool. If the payoff matrices are drawn randomly from an arbitrary distribution, what are the probabilities of observing a certain number of (stable) equilibria? We extend the domain of previous results for the two-player framework, which corresponds to a single diploid locus in population genetics, by addressing the full complexity of multi-player games with multiple strategies. In closing, we discuss an application and illustrate how previous results on the number of equilibria, such as the famous Feldman-Karlin conjecture on the maximal number of isolated fixed points in a viability selection model, can be obtained as special cases of our results based on multi-player evolutionary games. We also show how the probability of realizing a certain number of equilibria changes as we increase the number of players and number of strategies. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

In addition, the caricature system illustrates how large standard deviation and low kurtosis facilitate the formation of these spatiotemporal patterns.

	abstract = {In flowering plants, the haploid phase is reduced to the pollen grain and embryo sac. These reproductive tissues (gametophytes) are actually distinct individuals that have a different genome from the plant (sporophyte), and are more or less independent. The morphology of pollen grains, particularly the openings permitting pollen tube germination (apertures), is crucial for determining the outcome of pollen competition. Many species of flowering plants simultaneously produce pollen grains with different aperture numbers in a single individual (heteromorphism). In this paper, we show that the heteromorphic pollen aperture pattern depends on the genetic control of pollen morphogenesis. This points out a conflict of interest between genes expressed in the sporophyte and genes expressed in the gametophyte. More generally, such a conflict should exist whenever heteromorphism is an ESS resulting from a bet-hedging strategy. For pollen aperture, heteromorphism has been observed in about 40% of angiosperm species, suggesting that conflicting situations are the rule. In this context, the sporo-gametophytic conflict could be one of the factors that led to the reduction of the haploid phase in plants. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {The Wright-Fisher model of allele dynamics forms the basis for most theoretical and applied research in population genetics. Our understanding of genetic drift, and its role in suppressing the deterministic forces of Darwinian selection has relied on the specific form of sampling inherent to the Wright-Fisher model and its diffusion limit. Here we introduce and analyze a broad class of forward-time population models that share the same mean and variance as the Wright-Fisher model, but may otherwise differ. The proposed class unifies and further generalizes a number of population-genetic processes of recent interest, including the and Cannings processes. Even though these models all have the same variance effective population size, they encode a rich diversity of alternative forms of genetic drift, with significant consequences for allele dynamics. We characterize in detail the behavior of standard population-genetic quantities across this family of generalized models. Some quantities, such as heterozygosity, remain unchanged; but others, such as neutral absorption times and fixation probabilities under selection, deviate by orders of magnitude from the Wright-Fisher model. We show that generalized population models can produce startling phenomena that differ qualitatively from classical behavior - such as assured fixation of a new mutant despite the presence of genetic drift. We derive the forward-time continuum limits of the generalized processes, analogous to Kimura's diffusion limit of the Wright-Fisher process, and we discuss their relationships to the Kingman and non-Kingman coalescents. Finally, we demonstrate that some non-diffusive, generalized models are more likely, in certain respects, than the Wright-Fisher model itself, given empirical data from Drosophila populations. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

Here we study the evolution of bids in biological auctions. For each auction, n individuals are drawn at random from a population of size N. Each individual makes a bid which entails a cost. The winner obtains a benefit of a certain value. Costs and benefits are translated into reproductive success (fitness). Therefore, successful bidding strategies spread in the population. We compare two types of auctions. In "biological all-pay auctions", the costs are the bid for every participating individual. In "biological second price all-pay auctions", the cost for everyone other than the winner is the bid, but the cost for the winner is the second highest bid. Second price all-pay auctions are generalizations of the "war of attrition" introduced by Maynard Smith. We study evolutionary dynamics in both types of auctions. We calculate pairwise invasion plots and evolutionarily stable distributions over the continuous strategy space. We find that the average bid in second price all-pay auctions is higher than in all-pay auctions, but the average cost for the winner is similar in both auctions. In both cases, the average bid is a declining function of the number of participants, n. The more individuals participate in an auction the smaller is the chance of winning, and thus expensive bids must be avoided. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

In a univariate setting, past work has shown that epistasis reduces genetic variance (additive plus epistatic) in a population experiencing stabilizing selection. Here we show that in a multivariate setting, epistasis also reduces total genetic variation across the entire multivariate trait in a population experiencing stabilizing selection. But, we also show that the pattern of variation across the multivariate trait can be more even when epistasis occurs compared to when epistasis is absent, such that some character combinations will have more genetic variance when epistasis occurs compared to when epistasis is absent. In fact, a measure of generalized multivariate trait variation can be increased by epistasis under weak to moderate stabilizing selection conditions, as well as neutral conditions. Likewise, a measure of conditional evolvability can be increased by epistasis under weak to moderate stabilizing selection and neutral conditions. We investigate the nature of epistasis assuming a multivariate-normal model genetic effects and investigate the nature of epistasis underlying the biophysical properties of RNA. Increased multivariate diversity occurs for populations that are infinite in size, as well as populations that are finite in size.

Once in a given stage, an individual's ability to survive, reproduce or move to another stage are fixed for that stage. Some demographic models consider that environmental conditions may change, and thus the chances of reproducing, dying or developing to another stage depend on the current stage and environmental conditions. That is, models have evolved from a single transition matrix to a set of several transition matrices, each accounting for the properties of a given environment. These models require information on the transition between environments, which is in general assumed to be Markovian. Although great progress has been made in the analysis of these models, they present new challenges and some new parameters need to be calculated, mainly the ones related to how births are distributed among environments. These parameters may help in population management and to calculate unconditional life history parameters. We derive for the first time an expression for the long-run distribution of births across environments, and show that it does not depend only on the long-range frequency of different environments, but also on the set of all transition and fertility matrices. We also derive the long-run distribution of deaths across environments. We provide an example using a real data set of the dynamics of Saiga antelope.

This allows the male form to devote energy to the development of some costly male traits that help the males to compete for access to females. These costly male traits are sexually dimorphic.

	abstract = {Monomorphic loci evolve through a series of substitutions on a fitness landscape. Understanding how mutation, selection, and genetic drift drive this process, and uncovering the structure of the fitness landscape from genomic data are two major goals of evolutionary theory. Population genetics models of the substitution process have traditionally focused on the weak-selection regime, which is accurately described by diffusion theory. Predictions in this regime can be considered universal in the sense that many population models exhibit equivalent behavior in the diffusion limit. However, a growing number of experimental studies suggest that strong selection plays a key role in some systems, and thus there is a need to understand universal properties of models without . a priori assumptions about selection strength. Here we study time reversibility in a general substitution model of a monomorphic haploid population. We show that for . any time-reversible population model, such as the Moran process, substitution rates obey an exact scaling law. For several other irreversible models, such as the simple Wright-Fisher process and its extensions, the scaling law is accurate up to selection strengths that are well outside the diffusion regime. Time reversibility gives rise to a power-law expression for the steady-state distribution of populations on an arbitrary fitness landscape. The steady-state behavior is dominated by weak selection and is thus adequately described by the diffusion approximation, which guarantees universality of the steady-state formula and its applicability to the problem of reconstructing fitness landscapes from DNA or protein sequence data. © 2012 Elsevier Inc..},

For neutral genetic variation, the ratio of singletons to the total number of segregating sites is equivalent to the ratio of total length of external branches to the total length of the gene genealogy. A multinomial maximum likelihood method that takes into account more frequency classes than just the singletons is developed to estimate the parameter of another large offspring number model. The performance of these methods with regard to sample size, mutation rate, and bias, is investigated by simulation. The expected value of the ratio of the total length of external branches to the total length of the whole tree is, using simulation, shown to decrease for the Kingman coalescent as sample size increases, but can increase or decrease, depending on parameter values, for λ coalescents. Considering ratios of tree statistics, as opposed to considering lengths of various subtrees separately, can yield better insight into the dynamics of gene genealogies. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

Typically, interactions are mediated through the environment by molecules and proteins that are products of cell metabolism and physiology; they therefore reflect the internal dynamics of the single cell. In this work we aim to integrate single-cell properties of gene expression that affect indirect interactions between microorganisms under challenging conditions, into a quantitative model of population dynamics. Specifically we address the problem of a microbial population secreting a protein that can actively extract a growth-limiting resource, such as a simple sugar or iron, from the environment. The genes coding for the protein can undergo random epigenetic transitions between active and silenced states, and can be repressed by the product of their reaction. We model cooperative and competitive interactions between protein producing and non-producing phenotypes by nonlinear dynamical systems and analyze them both in terms of asymptotic states and of transient dynamics. Our model shows that phenotypic transitions allow a stable coexistence of the two phenotypes, and enables us to make predictions regarding the conditions required for such coexistence and the typical timescales of transient dynamics. It also shows how repression by the reaction product induces a feedback at the population-environment level that can result in limit cycle dynamics.

The application to genetic mark-recapture methodology in wildlife species can therefore be prone to misidentifications leading to both true non-recaptures' being falsely accepted as recaptures (Type I errors) and true recaptures' being undetected (Type II errors). Here we present a new likelihood method that allows every pairwise genotype comparison to be evaluated independently. We apply this method to determine the total number of recaptures by estimating and optimising the balance between Type I errors and Type II errors. We show through simulation that the standard error of recapture estimates can be minimised through our algorithms. Interestingly, the precision of our recapture estimates actually improved when we included individuals with missing genotypes, as this increased the number of pairwise comparisons potentially uncovering more recaptures. Simulations suggest that the method is tolerant to per locus error rates of up to 5% per locus and can theoretically work in datasets with as little as 60% of loci genotyped. Our methods can be implemented in datasets where standard mismatch analyses fail to distinguish recaptures. Finally, we show that by assigning a low Type I error rate to our matching algorithms we can generate a dataset of individuals of known capture histories that is suitable for the downstream analysis with traditional mark-recapture methods. © 2011.},

The effect of incorporating partial panmixia into single-locus clines maintained by migration and selection is investigated. In a diallelic, two-deme model without dominance, partial panmixia can increase or decrease both the polymorphic area in the plane of the migration rates and the equilibrium gene-frequency difference between the two demes. For multiple alleles, under the assumptions that the number of demes is large and both migration and selection are arbitrary but weak, a system of integro-partial differential equations is derived. For two alleles with conservative migration, (i) a Lyapunov functional is found, suggesting generic global convergence of the gene frequency; (ii) conditions for the stability or instability of the fixation states, and hence for a protected polymorphism, are obtained; and (iii) a variational representation of the minimal selection-migration ratio λ0 (the principal eigenvalue of the linearized system) for protection from loss is used to prove that λ0 is an increasing function of the panmictic rate and to deduce the effect on λ0 of changes in selection and migration. The unidimensional step-environment with uniform population density, homogeneous, isotropic migration, and no dominance is examined in detail: An explicit characteristic equation is derived for λ0; bounds on λ0 are established; and λ0 is approximated in four limiting cases. An explicit formula is also deduced for the globally asymptotically stable cline in an unbounded habitat with a symmetric environment; partial panmixia maintains some polymorphism even as the distance from the center of the cline tends to infinity. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {In this paper we present a model that maps epistatic effects onto a genealogical tree for a haploid population. Prior work has demonstrated that genealogical structure causes the genotypic values of individuals to covary. Our results indicate that epistasis can reduce genotypic covariance that is caused by genealogical structure. Genotypic effects (both additive and epistatic) occur along the branches of a genealogical tree, from the base of the tree to its tips. Epistasis reduces genotypic covariance because there is a reweighting of the contribution of branches to the states of genotypes compared to the additive case. Branches near the tips of a genealogical tree contribute proportionally more genetic effects with epistasis than without epistasis. Epistatic effects are most numerous at basal positions in a genealogical tree when a population is constant in size and experiencing no selection, optimizing selection, diversifying selection or directional selection, indicating that epistatic effects are typically old. For a population that is growing in size, epistatic effects are most numerous at midpoints in a genealogical tree, indicating epistatic effects are of moderate age. Our results are important in that they suggest epistatic effects may typically explain deep (old) divergences and broad patterns of divergence that exist in populations, except in growing populations. In a growing population, epistatic effects may cause more within group divergence higher up in a tree and less between group divergence that is deep in a tree. The distribution of the number of epistatic effects and the expected variance and covariance in the number of epistatic effects is also provided assuming neutrality. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

In a coupled chaos system describing the dynamics of individual-plant resource budgets, masting occurs when the resource depletion coefficient k (ratio of the reproductive expenditure to the excess resource reserve) is large. Here, we mathematically studied the condition for masting evolution. In an infinitely large population, we obtained a deterministic dynamical system, to which we applied the pairwise invasibility plot and convergence stability of evolutionary singularity analyses. We prove that plants reproducing at the same rate every year are not evolutionarily stable. The resource depletion coefficient k increases, and the system oscillates with a period of 2 years (high and low reproduction) if k< 1. Alternatively, k may evolve further and jump to a value >1, resulting in the sudden start of intermittent reproduction. We confirm that a high survivorship of young plants (seedlings) in the light-limited understory favors masting evolution, as previously suggested by computer simulations and field observations. The stochasticity caused by the finiteness of population size also promotes masting evolution. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we revisit the stabilizing role that predator dispersal and aggregation have in the top-down regulation of predator-prey systems in a heterogeneous environment. We consider an environment consisting of sites interconnected by dispersal, and propose a novel mechanism of stabilization for the case with a non-sigmoid functional response of predators. We assume that the carrying capacity of the prey is infinitely large in each site, and show that successful top-down regulation of this otherwise globally unstable system is made possible through an interplay between the unevenness of prey fitness across the sites and the rapid food-dependent migration of predators. We argue that this mechanism of stabilization is different from those previously reported in the literature: in particular, it requires a high degree of synchronicity in local oscillations of species densities across the sites. Prey outbreaks take place synchronously, but the unevenness of prey growth rates across the sites results in a pronounced difference in the species densities, and so the predator quickly disperses to the sites with the highest prey abundances. For this reason, the consumption of prey mostly takes place in the sites with high densities of prey, which assures an efficient suppression of outbreaks. Furthermore, when the total size of prey population is low, the distribution of both species among the sites becomes more even, and this prevents overconsumption of the prey by the predator. Finally, we put forward the hypothesis that this mechanism, when considered in a tri-trophic plankton community in the water column, can explain the stability of the nutrient-rich low-chlorophyll open ocean regions. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {The sample frequency spectrum of a segregating site is the probability distribution of a sample of alleles from a genetic locus, conditional on observing the sample to be polymorphic. This distribution is widely used in population genetic inferences, including statistical tests of neutrality in which a skew in the observed frequency spectrum across independent sites is taken as a signature of departure from neutral evolution. Theoretical aspects of the frequency spectrum have been well studied and several interesting results are available, but they are usually under the assumption that a site has undergone at most one mutation event in the history of the sample. Here, we extend previous theoretical results by allowing for at most two mutation events per site, under a general finite allele model in which the mutation rate is independent of current allelic state but the transition matrix is otherwise completely arbitrary. Our results apply to both nested and nonnested mutations. Only the former has been addressed previously, whereas here we show it is the latter that is more likely to be observed except for very small sample sizes. Further, for any mutation transition matrix, we obtain the joint sample frequency spectrum of the two mutant alleles at a triallelic site, and derive a closed-form formula for the expected age of the younger of the two mutations given their frequencies in the population. Several large-scale resequencing projects for various species are presently under way and the resulting data will include some triallelic polymorphisms. The theoretical results described in this paper should prove useful in population genomic analyses of such data. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {The relative role of dynamic and fixed heterogeneity in shaping the individual heterogeneity observed in most life-history traits remains difficult to quantify. In a recent work, . Tuljapurkar etal. (2009) suggested modeling individual heterogeneity in lifetime reproductive success by a null model building reproductive trajectories from a first-order Markov chain. According to this model, among-individual differences in reproductive trajectories would be generated by the stochastic transitions among reproductive states (such as breeder and non-breeder) due to dynamic heterogeneity. In this work, we analyze the individual variation in three reproductive metrics (reproductive status, fecundity, and reproductive success) in two populations of roe deer intensively monitored using Tuljapurkar etal. (2009)'s dynamic model. Moreover, we challenge the Tuljapurkar model previously used as a biological null model to test whether the observed distribution of reproductive success over the lifetime was generated by a stochastic process by modifying two steps of the previous model to build a full stochastic model. We show that a distribution generated by the full dynamic model proposed by Tuljapurkar etal. (2009) can be consistently interpreted as only generated from a stochastic biological process provided that the probabilities of transition among reproductive states used are independent of the current reproductive state and that the positive co-variation that usually occurs between survival and reproduction among individuals is removed. Only the reproductive status of roe deer females could be restricted to a stochastic process described by the full stochastic model, probably because most females (>90%) were breeders in a given year. The fecundity of roe deer females could not be adequately described by the full dynamic and full stochastic model, and the observed distribution of female reproductive success differed from the one generated by a full dynamic model in which each individual reproductive trajectory was independent of the individual lifespan (second step of the full dynamic model changed). While there was clear evidence that dynamic heterogeneity occurred and accounted for a large part of the observed among-individual variation in reproductive trajectories of roe deer females, a stochastic process did not provide a suitable model for all reproductive metrics. Consequently, models including additional fixed and dynamic traits need to be built in order to separate the relative role of fixed and dynamic heterogeneities in generating reproductive trajectories. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Population subdivision and migration are generally considered to be important causes of linkage disequilibrium (LD). We explore the combined effects of recombination and gene flow on the amount of LD, the maintenance of polymorphism, and the degree of local adaptation in a subdivided population by analyzing a diploid, deterministic continent-island model with genic selection on two linked loci (i.e., no dominance or epistasis). For this simple model, we characterize explicitly all possible equilibrium configurations. Simple and intuitive approximations for many quantities of interest are obtained in limiting cases, such as weak migration, weak selection, weak or strong recombination. For instance, we derive explicit expressions for the measures D(=p AB-p Ap B) and r 2 (the squared correlation in allelic state) of LD. They depend in qualitatively different ways on the migration rate. Remarkably high values of r 2 are maintained between weakly linked loci, especially if gene flow is low. We determine how the maximum amount of gene flow that admits preservation of the locally adapted haplotype, hence of polymorphism at both loci, depends on recombination rate and selection coefficients. We also investigate the evolution of differentiation by examining the invasion of beneficial mutants of small effect that are linked to an already present, locally adapted allele. Mutants of much smaller effect can invade successfully than predicted by naive single-locus theory provided they are at least weakly linked. Finally, the influence of linkage on the degree of local adaptation, the migration load, and the effective migration rate at a neutral locus is explored. We discuss possible consequences for the evolution of genetic architecture, in particular, for the emergence of clusters of tightly linked, slightly beneficial mutations and the evolution of recombination and chromosome inversions. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

In all cases predator interference increased the average number of alternative attractors, whereas at the same time it reduced the emergence of oscillatory or chaotic dynamics. Our findings demonstrate a contrasting effect of predator interference on the stability of a community: on the one hand it reduces cycles and chaos in the dynamics, on the other hand predator interference increases the likelihood that communities may undergo critical transitions between multiple stable states. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {A long standing question in evolutionary biology concerns the maintenance of adaptive combinations of traits in the presence of recombination. This problem may be solved if positive epistasis selects for reducing the rate of recombination between such traits, but this requires sufficiently strong epistasis. Here we use a model that we developed previously to analyze a frequency-dependent strategy game in asexual populations, to study how adaptive combinations of traits may be maintained in the presence of recombination when epistasis is too weak to select for genetic linkage. Previously, in the asexual case, our model demonstrated the evolution of adaptive associations between social foraging strategies and learning rules. We verify that these adaptive associations, which are represented by different two-locus haplotypes, can easily be broken by genetic recombination. We also confirm that a modifier allele that reduces the rate of recombination fails to evolve (due to weak epistasis). However, we find that under the same conditions of weak epistasis, there is an alternative mechanism that allows an association between traits to evolve. This is based on a genetic switch that responds to the presence of one social foraging allele by activating one of the two alternative learning alleles that are carried by all individuals. We suggest that such coordinated phenotypic expression by genetic switches offers a general and robust mechanism for the evolution of adaptive combinations of traits in the presence of recombination. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

It is assumed that the number of immigrants per age is limited. We consider two alternative policies. In the first one, we fix the total number of people who annually immigrate to a country. In the second one, we prescribe the size of the receiving country's population.

	abstract = {Understanding the processes generating fluctuations of natural populations lies at the very heart of academic ecology. It is also very important for applications such as fisheries management and pest control. We are interested in the effect of harvesting on population fluctuations and for that purpose we develop and analyze an age-structured model where recruitment is a stochastic process and the adult segment of the population is harvested. When a constant annual harvest is taken the coefficient of variation of the adult population increases for most parameter values due to the age truncation effect, i.e. an increased variability in a juvenescent population due to the removal of older individuals. However, if a constant proportion of the adults is harvested the age truncation effect is sometimes counteracted by a stabilizing dynamic effect of harvesting. Depending on parameter values mirroring different life histories, proportional harvest can either increase or decrease the relative fluctuations of an exploited population. When there is a demographic Allee effect the ratio of juveniles to adults may actually decrease with harvesting. We conclude that, depending on life history and harvest strategy, harvesting can either reinforce or dampen population fluctuations due to the relative importance of stabilizing dynamic effects and the age truncation effect. The strength of the latter is highly dependent on the fished population's endogenous, age-structured dynamics. More specifically, we predict that populations with strong and positively autocorrelated dynamics will show stronger age truncation effect, a testable prediction that offers a simple rule-of-thumb assessment of a population's vulnerability to exploitation. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

However, much this work has implicitly assumed that interactions take place in panmictic populations with complete dispersal, where interactions are between unrelated individuals. Here, we examine the consequences of limited dispersal and population structure for the evolution of a male phenotype that is associated with the males pre- and post-copulatory reproductive success, using an inclusive-fitness based analysis applied to group-structured populations. We show that: (i) the sex-specific timing of the dispersal phase of the life cycle can drive the evolution of sexual conflict; (ii) the inclusive fitness of a female in this conflict is determined solely by direct (i.e. personal) effects on its own competitive ability. Our analysis is supported by results from individual-based simulations of multi-level selection. Our results support the suggestion that kin selection can influence the evolution of sexual conflict, but reveal that such a role might be more complex than previously appreciated when sex-specific life histories are taken into consideration. We discuss the implications of our results for sexual conflict in various species of insects, but focus primarily on dipteran flies of the family Sepsidae. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Ecotones represent locations where vegetation change is likely to occur as a result of climate and other environmental changes. Using a model of an ecotone vulnerable to such future changes, we estimated the resilience of the ecotone to disturbances. The specific ecotone is that between two different vegetation types, salinity-tolerant and salinity-intolerant, along a gradient in groundwater salinity. In the case studied, each vegetation type, through soil feedback loops, promoted local soil salinity levels that favor itself in competition with the other type. Bifurcation analysis was used to study the system of equations for the two vegetation types and soil salinity. Alternative stable equilibria, one for salinity-tolerant and one for salinity intolerant vegetation, were shown to exist over a region of the groundwater salinity gradient, bounded by two bifurcation points. This region was shown to depend sensitively on parameters such as the rate of upward infiltration of salinity from groundwater into the soil due to evaporation. We showed also that increasing diffusion rates of vegetation can lead to shrinkage of the range between the two bifurcation points. Sharp ecotones are typical of salt-tolerant vegetation (mangroves) near the coastline and salt-intolerant vegetation inland, even though the underlying elevation and groundwater salinity change very gradually. A disturbance such as an input of salinity to the soil from a storm surge could upset this stable boundary, leading to a regime shift of salinity-tolerant vegetation inland. We showed, however, that, for our model as least, a simple pulse disturbance would not be sufficient; the salinity would have to be held at a high level, as a 'press', for some time. The approach used here should be generalizable to study the resilience of a variety of ecotones to disturbances. © 2012 .},

Viability coefficients with symmetrically opposing directional selection in each niche are assumed, and with a further simplification that the most and least favored haplotype in each niche shares no alleles in common, and that the selection coefficients monotonically increase or decrease with the number of alleles shared. This model always admits a fully polymorphic symmetric equilibrium, which may or may not be stable.We show that a stable symmetric equilibrium can become unstable via either a supercritical or subcritical pitchfork bifurcation. In the supercritical bifurcation, the symmetric equilibrium bifurcates to a pair of stable fully polymorphic asymmetric equilibria; in the subcritical bifurcation, the symmetric equilibrium bifurcates to a pair of unstable fully polymorphic asymmetric equilibria, which then connect to either another pair of stable fully polymorphic asymmetric equilibria through saddle-node bifurcations, or to a pair of monomorphic equilibria through transcritical bifurcations. As many as three fully polymorphic stable equilibria can coexist, and jump bifurcations can occur between these equilibria when model parameters are varied.In our Levene model, increasing recombination can act to either increase or decrease the genetic diversity of a population. By generating more hybrid offspring from the mating of purebreds, recombination can act to increase genetic diversity provided the symmetric equilibrium remains stable. But by destabilizing the symmetric equilibrium, recombination can ultimately act to decrease genetic diversity. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

The survivor's dilemma (shortly: SVD) game consists in the following: a group member either surely survives alone by fleeing, while its defensive mate may be killed; or tries to save its mate's life, risking to get killed. The dilemma is that, in every single attack, fleeing ensures maximal survival probability, but if its mate survives by fighting both, and they remain together, its risk to be killed at the next attack will be lower. We show that, if defense is successful enough, then the one-attack game is a prisoner's dilemma (PD), where fleeing is the strict ESS. We have additively decomposed the SVD game, according to the survival of the group mate of the focal prey, into two games: the aim of the ". collective game" is survival of the group of prey. Counter-wise, the aim of the ". hostile game" is survival alone (focal prey survives and its mate is killed by the predator). We obtain the following results: if the attack number is large enough, the multi-attack SVD game is dominated by the "collective game" in the sense that each individual can ensure its own maximal survival probability by maximizing the group survival probability in each attack. In the hostile game, the only strict ESS is the fleeing strategy. In the collective game there are two different cases: either defense is a unique strict ESS, or the collective game is bistable, i.e. fleeing and defense are local strict ESS's. If defense is the only strict ESS in the collective game, and the attack number is large enough, defense replaces fleeing strategy in the multi-attack SVD game. However, in the bistable case, defense cannot invade into the fleeing population. It is shown that, if the interaction between relatives is frequent enough, than defense can replace fleeing strategy, in spite of the fact that in the well-mixed population the collective game is bistable. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

Antiquity 69, 197-214] proposed a model designed to show that larger population size facilitates cumulative cultural evolution toward higher skill levels. In this model, each newborn attempts to imitate the most highly skilled individual of the parental generation by directly-biased social learning, but the skill level he/she acquires deviates probabilistically from that of the exemplar (cultural parent). The probability that the skill level of the imitator exceeds that of the exemplar can be regarded as the innovation rate. After reformulating Henrich's model rigorously, we introduce an overlapping-generations analog based on the Moran model and derive an approximate formula for the expected change per generation of the highest skill level in the population. For large population size, our overlapping-generations model predicts a much larger effect of population size than Henrich's discrete-generations model. We then investigate by way of Monte Carlo simulations the case where each newborn chooses as his/her exemplar the most highly skilled individual from among a limited number of acquaintances. When the number of acquaintances is small relative to the population size, we find that a change in the innovation rate contributes more than a proportional change in population size to the cumulative cultural evolution of skill level. © 2012 Elsevier Inc..},

The formula is in full agreement with all field studies in which various phenomena triggering insect outbreaks have been identified. The observed consequences of introductions and removals of insects are also well predicted by the minimal model. But, even more surprisingly, the model allows a simple and explicit condition for the synchronization of outbreaks in spatially extended forests to be derived analytically.

In matrix population models, populations are described with discrete classes of individuals (age, life history stage or size). To calibrate these models, longitudinal data are collected at the individual level to estimate demographic parameters. However, several sources of uncertainty can complicate parameter estimation, such as imperfect detection of individuals inherent to monitoring in the wild and uncertainty in assigning a state to an individual. Here, we show how recent statistical models can help overcome these issues. We focus on hidden process models that run two time series in parallel, one capturing the dynamics of the true states and the other consisting of observations arising from these underlying possibly unknown states. In a first case study, we illustrate hidden Markov models with an example of how to accommodate state uncertainty using Frequentist theory and maximum likelihood estimation. In a second case study, we illustrate state-space models with an example of how to estimate lifetime reproductive success despite imperfect detection, using a Bayesian framework and Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation. Hidden process models are a promising tool as they allow population biologists to cope with process variation while simultaneously accounting for observation error. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Clonal reproduction of diploids leads to an increase in heterozygosity over time. A single round of selfing will then create new homozygotic genotypes. Given the same allele frequencies, heritable genetic variation is larger when there are more extreme, i.e. homozygotic genotypes. So after a long clonal expansion, one round of selfing increases heritable genetic variation, but any fully or partially recessive deleterious alleles simultaneously impose a fitness cost. Here we calculate that the cost of selfing in the yeast Saccharomyces is experienced only by a minority of zygotes. This allows a round of selfing to act as an evolutionary capacitor to unlock genetic variation previously found in a cryptic heterozygous form. We calculate the evolutionary consequences rather than the evolutionary causes of sex. We explore a range of parameter values describing sexual frequencies, focusing especially on the parameter values known for wild Saccharomyces. Our results are largely robust to many other parameter value choices, so long as meiosis is rare relative to the strength of selection on heterozygotes. Results may also be limited to organisms with a small number of genes. We therefore expect the same phenomenon in some other species with similar reproductive strategies. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

Viruses with fewer epitopes have a higher survival probability, and are selected through evolution. However, mutations have a fitness cost and on evolutionary periods viruses maintain some epitopes. The number of epitopes in each viral protein is a balance between the selective advantage of having fewer epitopes and the reduced fitness following the epitope removing mutations. We discuss a bioinformatic analysis of the number of epitopes in various viral proteins and propose an optimization framework to explain these numbers. We show, using a genomic analysis and a theoretical optimization framework, that a critical factor affecting the number of presented epitopes is the expression stage in the viral life cycle of the gene coding for the protein. The early expression of epitopes can lead to the destruction of the host cell before budding can take place. We show that a lower number of epitopes is expected in early proteins even if late proteins have a much higher copy number. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

Quotas are established by the respective government agency and licenses are issued to hunters to harvest an animal of specified age or sex during the following autumn. Because the cost of aerial monitoring is high, we use a Management Strategy Evaluation to evaluate the costs and benefits of periodic aerial surveys in the context of moose management. Our on-the-fly "seat of your pants" alternative to independent monitoring is management based solely on the kill of moose by hunters, which is usually sufficient to alert the manager to declines in moose abundance that warrant adjustments to harvest strategies. Harvests are relatively cheap to monitor; therefore, data can be obtained each year facilitating annual adjustments to quotas. Other sources of "cheap" monitoring data such as records of the number of moose seen by hunters while hunting also might be obtained, and may provide further useful insight into population abundance, structure and health.

Our main analysis applies the theory of branching processes, but a parallel analysis using the inclusive-fitness approach is also provided. Our first two results are modifications of known inequalities describing selective advantages for behaviours expressed conditional upon social status. We find that altruistic subordinate individuals are favoured more readily than previously thought; spiteful dominant individuals, however, are favoured less readily. Secondly, we identify the condition under which unconditional altruism (performed by both dominant and subordinate) will be adaptive. Our third main result shows that increasing the strength of selection can also change the range of parameters over which costly social behaviours are favoured. We find that stronger selection makes it relatively easier for subordinate altruism to emerge, but more difficult for dominant spite and unconditional altruism to occur.

Our model combines state-structured local demography (specified by an integral or matrix projection model) with general dispersal distributions that may depend on the state of the individual or its parent. It allows very general patterns of stationary temporal variation in both local demography and in the frequency and distribution of dispersal distances. We show that expressions for the asymptotic spread rate and its sensitivity to parameters, which have been derived previously for less general models, continue to hold. Using these results we show that random temporal variability in dispersal can accelerate population spread. Demographic variability can further accelerate spread if it is positively correlated with dispersal variability, for example if high-fecundity years are also years in which juveniles tend to settle further away from their parents. A simple model for the growth and spread of patches of an invasive plant (perennial pepperweed, Lepidium latifolium) illustrates these effects and shows that they can have substantial impacts on the predicted speed of an invasion wave. Temporal variability in dispersal has received very little attention in both the theoretical and empirical literature on invasive species spread.

However, these parameters are poorly known, in large part because of the difficulty of designing and interpreting experiments to examine the rare and intrinsically stochastic process of mutation occurrence. We present a new approach to estimate the rate and selective advantage of beneficial mutations that underlie the adaptation of asexual populations. We base our approach on the analysis of experiments that track the effect of newly arising beneficial mutations on the dynamics of a neutral marker in evolving bacterial populations and develop efficient estimators of mutation rate and selective advantage. Using extensive simulations, we evaluate the accuracy of our estimators and conclude that they are quite robust to the use of relatively low experimental replication. To validate the predictions of our model, we compare theoretical and experimentally determined estimates of the selective advantage of the first beneficial mutation to fix in a series of ten replicate populations. We find that our theoretical predictions are not significantly different from experimentally determined selection coefficients. Application of our method to suitably designed experiments will allow estimation of how population evolvability depends on demographic and initial fitness parameters. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Sexually transmitted pathogens persist in populations despite the availability of biomedical interventions and knowledge of behavioural changes that would reduce individual-level risk. While behavioural risk factors are shared between many sexually transmitted infections, the prevalence of these diseases across different risk groups varies. Understanding this heterogeneity and identifying better control strategies depends on an improved understanding of the complex social contact networks over which pathogens spread. To date, most efforts to study the impact of sexual network structure on disease dynamics have focused on static networks. However, the interaction between the dynamics of partnership formation and dissolution and the dynamics of transmission plays a role, both in restricting the effective network accessible to the pathogen, and in modulating the transmission dynamics. We present a simple method to simulate dynamical networks of sexual partnerships. We inform the model using survey data on sexual attitudes and lifestyles, and investigate how the duration of infectiousness changes the effective contact network over which disease may spread. We then simulate several control strategies: screening, vaccination and behavioural interventions. Previous theory and research has advanced the importance of core groups for spread and control of STD. Our work is consistent with the importance of core groups, but extends this idea to consider how the duration of infectiousness associated with a particular pathogen interacts with host behaviours to define these high risk subpopulations. Characteristics of the parts of the network accessible to the pathogen, which represent the network structure of sexual contacts from the "point of view" of the pathogen, are substantially different from those of the network as a whole. The pathogen itself plays an important role in determining this effective network structure; specifically, we find that if the pathogen's duration of infectiousness is short, infection is more concentrated in high-activity, high-concurrency individuals even when all other factors are held constant. Widespread screening programmes would be enhanced by follow-up interventions targeting higher-risk individuals, because screening shortens the expected duration of infectiousness and causes a greater relative decrease in prevalence among lower-activity than in higher-activity individuals. Even for pathogens with longer durations of infectiousness, our findings suggest that targeting vaccination and behavioural interventions towards high-activity individuals provides comparable benefits to population-wide interventions. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Methods of calculating the distributions of the time to coalescence depend on the underlying model of population demography. In particular, the models assuming deterministic evolution of population size may not be applicable to populations evolving stochastically. Therefore the study of coalescence models involving stochastic demography is important for applications. One interesting approach which includes stochasticity is the O'Connell limit theory of genealogy in branching processes. Our paper explores how many generations are needed for the limiting distributions of O'Connell to become adequate approximations of exact distributions. We perform extensive simulations of slightly supercritical branching processes and compare the results to the O'Connell limits. Coalescent computations under the Wright-Fisher model are compared with limiting O'Connell results and with full genealogy-based predictions. These results are used to estimate the age of the so-called mitochondrial Eve, i.e., the root of the mitochondrial polymorphisms of the modern humans based on the DNA from humans and Neanderthal fossils. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

This formulation allows derivation of maximum likelihood estimates of the allele probabilities and θ together with computation of the profile log-likelihood, confidence intervals and hypothesis testing.

The population is divided into juvenile and adult individuals that consume different resources and do not interfere with each other. Over a broad range of external conditions (varying mortality and different resource levels), alternative stable states exist. These population states correspond to domination of juveniles and domination of adults, respectively. When mortality is varied, hysteresis between the alternative states only occurs if juveniles have more resources than adults. In the opposite case the juvenile-dominated state is stable for all values of mortality, but the adult-dominated state is not. When the population is modelled with more than one juvenile stage, the adult-dominated state becomes a periodic orbit due to a delay in the regulatory mechanism of the population dynamics. It is shown numerically that the stage-structured model converges to a model with continuous size structure for very large numbers of successive juvenile stages. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Complex systems in which balancing selection is prevalent, such as sets of human immune system genes, are known to contain components that interact epistatically. Therefore, current methods may not produce reliable inference on the strength of selection at these loci. In this paper, we address this problem by presenting statistical methods that can account for epistatic interactions in making inference about balancing selection. A theoretical result due to Fearnhead (2006) is used to build a multi-locus Wright-Fisher model of balancing selection, allowing for epistatic interactions among loci. Antagonistic and synergistic types of interactions are examined. The joint posterior distribution of the selection and mutation parameters is sampled by Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, and the plausibility of models is assessed via Bayes factors. As a component of the inference process, an algorithm to generate multi-locus allele frequencies under balancing selection models with epistasis is also presented. Recent evidence on interactions among a set of human immune system genes is introduced as a motivating biological system for the epistatic model, and data on these genes are used to demonstrate the methods. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

This extends the dual process construction for a multi-type Moran model with genic selection described in Etheridge and Griffiths (2009). We show that in the limit of infinite population size the non-neutral Moran models converge to a Markov jump process which we call the Λ-Fleming-Viot process with viability selection and we derive a coalescent dual for this process directly from the generator and as a limit from the Moran models. The dual is a branching-coalescing process similar to the Ancestral Selection Graph which follows the typed ancestry of genes backwards in time with real and virtual lineages. As an application, the transition functions of the non-neutral Moran and Λ-coalescent models are expressed as mixtures of the transition functions of the dual process. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

An innovation, such as a modification in an attribute of a handaxe, may be lost or may become a property of all handaxes, which we call "fixation of the innovation." Alternatively, several innovations may attain appreciable frequencies, in which case properties of the frequency distribution-for example, of handaxe measurements-is important. Here we apply the Moran model from the stochastic theory of population genetics to study the evolution of cultural innovations. We obtain the probability that an initially rare innovation becomes fixed, and the expected time this takes. When variation in cultural traits is due to recurrent innovation, copy error, and sampling from generation to generation, we describe properties of this variation, such as the level of heterogeneity expected in the population. For all of these, we determine the effect of the mode of social transmission: conformist, where there is a tendency for each naïve newborn to copy the most popular variant; pro-novelty bias, where the newborn prefers a specific variant if it exists among those it samples; one-to-many transmission, where the variant one individual carries is copied by all newborns while that individual remains alive. We compare our findings with those predicted by prevailing theories for rates of cultural change and the distribution of cultural variation. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

However, size-dependent sex changing plants often show size-independent reproductive success, presumably due to pollen limitation. Can the observed size-dependent sex change pattern be the ESS in this case? To answer this question, we analyze a game model of size-dependent sex expression in plants. We assume: (1) reproductive rate is perfectly independent of size; (2) mortality decreases with size in the same way for both sexes; (3) growth rates decrease at maturity, more for females than males. We show that the ESS is size-dependent sex expression: small individuals are vegetative, intermediate individuals are male, and large individuals are female. These results demonstrate that mortality is important in size-dependent sex allocation even when mortality rate is independent of sex.

	abstract = {With technological advances in genetic mapping studies more of the genes and polymorphisms that underlie Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) are now being identified. As the identities of these genes become known there is a growing need for an analysis framework that incorporates the molecular interactions affected by natural polymorphisms. As a step towards such a framework we present a molecular model of genetic variation in sporulation efficiency between natural isolates of the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The model is based on the structure of the regulatory pathway that controls sporulation. The model captures the phenotypic variation between strains carrying different combinations of alleles at known QTL. Compared to a standard linear model the molecular model requires fewer free parameters, and has the advantage of generating quantitative hypotheses about the affinity of specific molecular interactions in different genetic backgrounds. Our analyses provide a concrete example of how the thermodynamic properties of protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions naturally give rise to epistasis, the non-linear relationship between genotype and phenotype. As more causative genes and polymorphisms underlying QTL are identified, thermodynamic analyses of quantitative traits may provide a useful framework for unraveling the complex relationship between genotype and phenotype. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {Bacterial insertion sequences are the simplest form of autonomous mobile DNA. It is unknown whether they need to have beneficial effects to infect and persist in bacterial populations, or whether horizontal gene transfer suffices for their persistence. We address this question by using branching process models to investigate the critical, early phase of an insertion sequence infection. We find that the probability of a successful infection is low and depends linearly on the difference between the rate of horizontal gene transfer and the fitness cost of the insertion sequences. Our models show that the median time to extinction of an insertion sequence that dies out is very short, while the median time for a successful infection to reach a modest population size is very long. We conclude that horizontal gene transfer is strong enough to allow the persistence of insertion sequences, although infection is an erratic and slow process. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

With L diallelic loci, this algorithm is theoretically a factor of a constant times (3 / 8)L faster than standard computations with selection on diploids, and up to 16 recombining loci have been computed. This algorithm is then applied to model the opposing evolutionary forces of multilocus epistatic selection and recombination. Selection is assumed to favor haplotypes with specific alleles either all present or all absent. When the number of linked loci exceeds a critical value, a jump bifurcation occurs in the two-dimensional parameter space of the selection coefficient s and the recombination frequency r.

However, the introduction of intrinsic demographic stochasticity can reverse this conclusion. We present a simple model in which competition between the exploitation of resources and stochastic fluctuations leads to victory by either the faster or slower of two species depending on the environmental parameters. A simplified limiting case of the model, analyzed by closing the moment and correlation hierarchy, quantitatively predicts which species will win in the complete model under given parameters of spatial variation and average carrying capacity. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The combination of a variable environment and competition leads to the storage-effect coexistence mechanism (SE), which is a leading hypothesis for coexistence of desert annual plants. However, seed predation in such systems demands attention to coexistence mechanisms associated with predation. FDP is one such mechanism, which promotes coexistence by shifting predation to more abundant plant species, facilitating the recovery of species perturbed to low density. When present together, FDP and SE interact, undermining each other's effects. Predation weakens competition, and therefore weakens mechanisms associated with competition: here SE. However, the direct effect of FDP in promoting coexistence can compensate or more than compensate for this weakening of SE. On the other hand, the environmental variation necessary for SE weakens FDP. With high survival of dormant seeds, SE can be strong enough to compensate, or overcompensate, for the decline in FDP, provided predation is not too strong. Although FDP and SE may simultaneously contribute to coexistence, their combined effect is less than the sum of their separate effects, and is often less than the effect of the stronger mechanism when present alone. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

This phenomenon is known as the formation of a search image for a certain prey by a predator and is related to apostatic selection. Here, we study the evolution of a search image in the predator by formulating and analysing a mathematical model. The predator forages for two prey types and is able to form an independent search image for both prey. The results show that the evolutionary dynamics can be divided into two parts: a fast and a slow part. At first selection pressure will be strong towards a stable ratio of prey, which is the same as the ratio found for the unbeatable prey choice for predators with a Holling type II functional response. Following this, the slow dynamics will keep this ratio constant independent of the trait values, but the predator will slowly evolve towards a stronger search image and ultimately become a specialist predator or slowly evolve towards generalist with a weak search image. In conclusion, the formation of a search image causes the predator to control the prey densities such that the ratio of available prey is kept constant by the predator. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

A variety of more specific models, representing quite diverse biological situations, are covered by the Wildcard Model as particular cases. Two very different particular models that are subsumed by the Wildcard Model are the game theoretically motivated two-phenotype model of Lessard [Lessard, S.,1984. Evolutionary dynamics in frequency-dependent two-phenotype models, Theor. Popul. Biol. 25, 210-234], and the model of selection on a continuous trait due to intraspecific competition of Bürger [Bürger, R., 2005. A multilocus analysis of intraspecific competition and stabilizing selection on a quantitative trait. J. Math. Biol. 50 (4), 355-396] and Schneider [Schneider, K.A., 2006. A multilocus-multiallele analysis of frequency-dependent selection induced by intraspecific competition. J. Math. Biol. 52 (4), 483-523]. Both these models have been shown in the past to have a global Lyapunov function (LF) under appropriate genetic assumptions. We show that (i) the Wildcard Model in continuous time for a single multiallelic locus, or for multiple multiallelic loci in linkage equilibrium, has a global LF, of which the Lessard and Bürger-Scheneider LF are special cases in spite of their widely different biological interpretations; (ii) the LF of the Wildcard Model can be derived from an LF previously identified for a model of density- and frequency-dependent selection due to Lotka-Volterra competition, with one locus, multiple alleles, multiple species and continuous-time dynamics [Matessi, C., Jayakar, S.D., 1981. Coevolution of species in competition: A theoretical study. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 78 (2, part2), 1081-1084]. We extend the LF with density and frequency dependence to the multilocus case with linkage-equilibrium dynamics. As a possible application of our results, the optimization principle we established can be used as a tool in the study of long-term evolution of various models subsumed by the Wildcard Model based on explicit short-term dynamics. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

However, FDP undermines the competition-based coexistence mechanism called the storage effect (SEc), which relies on temporal environmental fluctuations that drive fluctuations in competition. Although environmental fluctuations also drive fluctuations in predation, a storage effect due to predation (SEp) may not arise due to a time lag between a change in the environment and the resulting change in the predation rate. Here we show how SEp can arise with multispecies FDP, and in a two-species setting with density-dependent frequency-dependence, partially compensating for the reduction in SEc, in the presence of predation. These outcomes occur when predatory behavior is flexible, and can accommodate to changes in prey abundances on a within-year time scale, leading to changes in predator preferences in response to prey abundances in a given year. When predator preferences are determined by average prey abundances over several years, FDP is still a strong coexistence mechanism but undermines SEc without creating SEp. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {The adverse effect of co-inheritance linkage of a large number of sites on adaptation has been studied extensively for asexual populations. However, it is insufficiently understood for multi-site populations in the presence of recombination. In the present work, motivated by our studies of HIV evolution in infected patients, we consider a model of haploid populations with infrequent recombination. We assume that small quantities of beneficial alleles preexist at a large number of sites and neglect new mutation. Using a generalized form of the traveling wave method, we show that the effectiveness of recombination is impeded and the adaptation rate is decreased by inter-sequence correlations, arising due to the fact that some pairs of homologous sites have common ancestors existing after the onset of adaptation. As the recombination rate per individual becomes smaller, site pairs with common ancestors become more frequent, making recombination even less effective. In addition, an increasing number of sites become identical by descent across large samples of sequences, causing reversion of the direction of evolution and the loss of beneficial alleles at these sites. As a result, within a 10-fold range of the recombination rate, the average adaptation rate falls from 90% of the infinite-recombination value down to 10%. The entire transition from almost maximum to almost zero may occur at very small recombination rates. Interestingly, the strong effect of linkage on the adaptation rate is predicted in the absence of average linkage disequilibrium (Lewontin's measure). © 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Environmental fluctuations often have different impacts on individuals that differ in size, age, or spatial location. To understand how population structure, environmental fluctuations, and density-dependent interactions influence population dynamics, we provide a general theory for persistence for density-dependent matrix models in random environments. For populations with compensating density dependence, exhibiting "bounded" dynamics, and living in a stationary environment, we show that persistence is determined by the stochastic growth rate (alternatively, dominant Lyapunov exponent) when the population is rare. If this stochastic growth rate is negative, then the total population abundance goes to zero with probability one. If this stochastic growth rate is positive, there is a unique positive stationary distribution. Provided there are initially some individuals in the population, the population converges in distribution to this stationary distribution and the empirical measures almost surely converge to the distribution of the stationary distribution. For models with overcompensating density-dependence, weaker results are proven. Methods to estimate stochastic growth rates are presented. To illustrate the utility of these results, applications to unstructured, spatially structured, and stage-structured population models are given. For instance, we show that diffusively coupled sink populations can persist provided that within patch fitness is sufficiently variable in time but not strongly correlated across space. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {We generalize a recently introduced graphical framework to compute the probability that haplotypes or genotypes of two individuals drawn from a finite, subdivided population match. As in the previous work, we assume an infinite-alleles model. We focus on the case of a population divided into two subpopulations, but the underlying framework can be applied to a general model of population subdivision. We examine the effect of population subdivision on the match probabilities and the accuracy of the product rule which approximates multi-locus match probabilities as a product of one-locus match probabilities. We quantify the deviation from predictions of the product rule by R, the ratio of the multi-locus match probability to the product of the one-locus match probabilities. We carry out the computation for two loci and find that ignoring subdivision can lead to underestimation of the match probabilities if the population under consideration actually has subdivision structure and the individuals originate from the same subpopulation. On the other hand, under a given model of population subdivision, we find that the ratio R for two loci is only slightly greater than 1 for a large range of symmetric and asymmetric migration rates. Keeping in mind that the infinite-alleles model is not the appropriate mutation model for STR loci, we conclude that, for two loci and biologically reasonable parameter values, population subdivision may lead to results that disfavor innocent suspects because of an increase in identity-by-descent in finite populations. On the other hand, for the same range of parameters, population subdivision does not lead to a substantial increase in linkage disequilibrium between loci. Those results are consistent with established practice. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

Here I examine this effect in terms of Fs t for a neutral allele by bringing together cytonuclear genomes with contrasting modes of inheritance. The relationships between cytonuclear disequilibrium and increment in Fs t are explored and confirmed through Monte Carlo simulations. Results show that the transient increment in Fs t for a neutral allele is not only related to the vectors of seed and pollen dispersal but also to the mode of its inheritance. Such increments can be substantial under certain conditions. Seed dispersal is more effective than pollen dispersal in changing the transient increment. The cumulative effects from multiple selective nuclear sites can amplify the transient increment in Fs t for a neutral paternal or maternal organelle allele. Selection on selective organelle sites facilitates the transient increment in Fs t for a neutral nuclear allele. Partial selfing can significantly reinforce the transient increment in Fs t. These theoretical insights highlight the roles of transient cytonuclear disequilibrium as a biological factor in evolving population differentiation and refine our practical interpretations of Fs t with cytonuclear markers. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

In the present study, we numerically analyze the consequences of relaxing this assumption. First, previous models assumed that assortative mating evolves in infinitesimal steps. Here, we show that the range of parameters for which speciation is possible increases when mutational steps are large. Second, it was assumed that the trait under frequency-dependent selection is determined by a single locus with two alleles and additive effects. As a consequence, the resultant intermediate phenotype is always heterozygous and can never breed true. To relax this assumption, here we add a second locus influencing the trait. We find three new possible evolutionary outcomes: evolution of three reproductively isolated species, a monomorphic equilibrium with only the intermediate phenotype, and a randomly mating population with a steep unimodal distribution of phenotypes. Both extensions of the original model thus increase the likelihood of competitive speciation. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

Cohort resonance is of particular interest because it involves selective sensitivity to specific time scales of environmental variability, including that of mean age of reproduction, and, more importantly, very low frequencies (i.e., trends). We present an age-structured model for two Pacific salmon species with environmental variability in survival rate and in individual growth rate, hence spawning age distribution. We use computed frequency response curves and analysis of the linearized dynamics to obtain two main results. First, the frequency response of the population is affected by the life history stage at which variability affects the population; varying growth rate tends to excite periodic resonance in age structure, while varying survival tends to excite low frequency fluctuation with more effect on total population size. Second, decreasing adult survival strengthens the cohort resonance effect at all frequencies, a finding that addresses the question of how fishing and climate change will interact. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {One predator-two prey community models are studied with an emphasis on individual variation in predator behavior. The predator behaves according to a well-known prey choice model. The behavioral model predicts that predators should always attack the primary prey (more profitable prey of the two), but only attack the alternative prey (less profitable prey of the two) when the density of the primary prey is below a threshold density. The predator that accepts the alternative prey does not discriminate between the primary and alternative prey (all-or-nothing preference for the alternative prey). However, empirical studies do not result in clear all-or-nothing responses. Previous models examined the relaxation of the all-or-nothing response by assuming partial preference (e.g., predators preferentially forage on the primary prey even when they also attack the alternative prey). In this study, I consider individual variation in two predator traits (prey density perception and handling time) as the sources of the variation in the threshold density, which can make empirical data appear deviated from the expectation. I examine how community models with partial preference and individual variation differ in their dynamics and show that the differences can be substantial. For example, the dynamics of a model based on individual variation can be more stable (e.g., stable in a wider parameter region) than that of a model based on partial preference. As the general statistical property (Jensen's inequality) is a main factor that causes the differences, the results of the study have general implications to the interpretation of models based on average per-capita rates. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

The geometric-mean fitness, over(w, ̃) (ρ), depends only on the vector of gene frequencies, ρ; it is nondecreasing, and the single-generation change is zero only on the set, Λ, of gametic frequencies at gene-frequency equilibrium. The internal gene-frequency equilibria are the stationary points of over(w, ̃) (ρ). If the equilibrium points over(ρ, ̂) of ρ (t) (where t denotes time in generations) are isolated, as is generic, then ρ (t) converges as t → ∞ to some over(ρ, ̂). Generically, ρ (t) converges to a local maximum of over(w, ̃) (ρ). Write the vector of gametic frequencies, p, as (ρ, d)T, where d represents the vector of linkage disequilibria. If over(ρ, ̂) is a local maximum of over(w, ̃) (ρ), then the equilibrium point (over(ρ, ̂), 0)T is asymptotically stable. If either there are only two loci or there is no dominance, then d (t) → 0 globally as t → ∞.

If underdominance and overdominance are excluded, and if at each locus, the degree of dominance is deme independent for every pair of alleles, then the following results also hold. There exists exactly one stable gene-frequency equilibrium (point or manifold), and it is globally attracting. If an internal gene-frequency equilibrium exists, it is globally asymptotically stable. On Λ, (i) the number of demes, Γ, is a generic upper bound on the number of alleles present per locus; and (ii) if every locus is diallelic, generically at most Γ - 1 loci can segregate.

An individual's fitness depends on its strategy choice or ecotype (predators decide which prey species to pursue and prey decide what proportion of their time to spend in the refuge) as well as on the population sizes of all three species. It is shown that, when there is a single prey species with a refuge or two prey species with no refuge compete only indirectly (i.e. there is only apparent competition between prey species), that stable resident systems where all individuals in each species have the same ecotype cannot be destabilized by the introduction of mutant ecotypes that are initially selectively neutral. In game-theoretic terms, this means that stable monomorphic resident systems, with ecotypes given by a Nash equilibrium, are both ecologically and evolutionarily stable. However, we show that this is no longer the case when the two indirectly-competing prey species have a refuge. This illustrates theoretically that two ecological factors, that are separately stabilizing (apparent competition and refuge use), may have a combined destabilizing effect from the evolutionary perspective. These results generalize the concept of an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) to models in evolutionary ecology. Several biological examples of predator-prey systems are discussed from this perspective. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Here we develop an analytical model of a temporal niche dynamic as a tool to examine how natural fluctuations in pest (enemy) levels may determine coexistence in competing annual plant species when one but not the other is affected by the pest. We show that the probability and speed with which the resistant drives out the sensitive species, coexists with it, or is driven out by its sensitive competitor depends on the cost of pest-resistance to the unaffected species, the frequency of high pest levels in the habitat and the competitive advantage of the sensitive species when the pest is not actively present.

	abstract = {Plankton population dynamics in the upper layer of the ocean depends on upwelling processes that bring nutrients from deeper waters. In turn, these depend on the structure of the vertical velocity field. In coastal areas and in oceanic regions characterized by the presence of strong submarine topographic features, the variable bottom topography induces significant effects on vertical velocities and upwelling/downwelling patterns. As a consequence, large plankton and fish abundances are frequently observed above seamounts, canyons and steep continental shelves. In this work, the dynamics of an NPZ (nutrient-phytoplankton-zooplankton) system is numerically studied by coupling the ecosystem model with a quasi two-dimensional (2D) fluid model with topography. At variance with classical 2D approaches, this formulation allows for an explicit expression of the vertical motions produced when fluid columns are squeezed and stretched as they experience changes of depth. Thus, input or output of nutrients at the surface are associated with fluid motion over the bottom topography. We examine the dynamics of a cyclonic vortex over two basic topographies: a steep escarpment and a submarine mountain. We show that plankton abundance over the escarpment is modulated by the passing of topographic Rossby waves, generated by the vortex-topography interaction. In such configuration, advection effects driven by the flow over the escarpment are of limited relevance for the dynamics of biological fields. By contrast, we find that the flow resulting from the interaction of a vortex with a seamount is sufficiently strong and persistent to allow for a remarkable increase of nutrients, and a corresponding enhancement of phytoplankton and zooplankton concentrations. Over the seamount, advection effects associated with trapped flow perturbations around the summit play an essential role. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {We analytically study a deterministic model for the spread of drug resistance among human malaria parasites. The model incorporates all major characteristics of the complex malaria transmission cycle and accounts for the fact that only a fraction α of infected hosts receive drug treatment. Furthermore, the model incorporates that hosts can be co-infected. The number m of parasites co-infecting a host is either a constant or, more generally, follows a given frequency distribution.Although the model is formulated in a multilocus setup, for our results we assume that drug resistance is caused by a single locus with two alleles - a sensitive one and a resistant one. We assume that the resistant allele has a selective advantage only in treated hosts and pays metabolic costs, which causes this allele to be deleterious in untreated hosts. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the fixation of the resistant allele. Moreover, provided the resistant allele will sweep through the population, we derive a formula for the time until it reaches a given frequency and in particular for the time until quasi-fixation.Furthermore, we establish an analytical solution for allele frequency changes at a linked neutral biallelic locus due to the rapid increase in frequency of the resistant allele. Our solution describes a local reduction in heterozygosity among parasite chromosomes around the resistant allele, the effect commonly referred to as the hitchhiking effect, as a function of α and m. The result therefore allows the investigation of selective sweep patterns under specific demographic settings. We find that the hitchhiking effect is similar but different from the standard model of genetic hitchhiking that assumes random mating and homogeneous selection. In particular, the process of recombination and selection cannot be decoupled. We further explain why standard hitchhiking theory cannot be applied to drug resistance in malaria. Furthermore, we will show that a genome-wide reduction in relative heterozygosity can occur provided a fraction of hosts is infected by a single parasite haplotype.Finally, we show how to incorporate host heterogeneity, and generalize our results to this biologically more realistic case. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

With general functions for intraspecific and interspecific direct competition, we derived necessary and sufficient conditions (except for a critical case that rarely occurs in a biological sense) that determine the number of stably coexisting species. From these conditions, we found that the number of coexisting species is determined just by the invasibility of each species into subcommunities with a smaller number of species. In addition, using a combination of rigorous mathematical theory and a simple graphical method, we can demonstrate how the stronger intraspecific direct competition facilitates species invasion, leading to a larger number of coexisting species. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {The dynamics of semi-arid plant communities are determined by the interplay between competition and facilitation among plants. The sign and strength of these biotic interactions depend on plant traits. However, the relationships between plant traits and biotic interactions, and the consequences for plant communities are still poorly understood. Our objective here was to investigate, with a modelling approach, the role of plant reproductive traits on biotic interactions, and the consequences for processes such as plant succession and invasion. The dynamics of two plant types were modelled with a spatially-explicit integrodifferential model: (1) a plant with seed dispersal (colonizer of bare soil) and (2) a plant with local vegetative propagation (local competitor). Both plant types were involved in facilitation due to a local positive feedback between vegetation biomass and soil water availability, which promoted establishment and growth. Plants in the system also competed for limited water. The efficiency in water acquisition (dependent on reproductive and growth plant traits) determined which plant type dominated the community at the steady state. Facilitative interactions between plant types also played an important role in the community dynamics, promoting establishment in the driest conditions and recovery from low biomass. Plants with vegetative propagation took advantage of the ability of seed dispersers to establish on bare soil from a low initial biomass. Seed dispersers were good invaders, maintained high biomass at intermediate and high rainfall and showed a high ability in taking profit from the positive feedback originated by plants with vegetative propagation under the driest conditions. However, seed dispersers lost competitiveness with an increasing investment in fecundity. All together, our results showed that reproductive plant traits can affect the balance between facilitative and competitive interactions. Understanding this effect of plant traits on biotic interactions provides insights in processes such as plant succession and shrub encroachment. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

Despite the small number of fitted parameters, model simulations are in good agreement with the observed average HAV incidence in all regions. Our results suggest that the mass vaccination program introduced in one Italian region only (Puglia, the one with the highest endemicity level) could have played a role in the decline of HAV incidence in the country as a whole. The only notable exception is represented by Campania, a Southern region showing a high endemicity level, which is not substantially affected by HAV dynamics in Puglia.

	abstract = {The fixation of mutant alleles has been studied with models assuming various spatial population structures. In these models, the structure of the metapopulation that we call the "landscape" (number, size and connectivity of subpopulations) is often static. However, natural populations are subject to repetitive population size variations, fragmentation and secondary contacts at different spatiotemporal scales due to geological, climatic and ecological processes. In this paper, we examine how such dynamic landscapes can alter mutant fixation probability and time to fixation. We consider three stochastic landscape dynamics: (i) the population is subject to repetitive bottlenecks, (ii) to the repeated alternation of fragmentation and fusion of demes with a constant population carrying capacity, (iii) idem with a variable carrying capacity. We show by deriving a variance, a coalescent and a harmonic mean population effective size, and with simulations that these landscape dynamics generate repetitive founder effects which counteract selection, thereby decreasing the fixation probability of an advantageous mutant but accelerate fixation when it occurs. For models (ii) and (iii), we also highlight an antagonistic "refuge effect" which can strongly delay mutant fixation. The predominance of either founder effects or refuge effects determines the time to fixation and mainly depends on the characteristic time scales of the landscape dynamics. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {In models of pathogen interaction and evolution discrete genotypes in the form of bit strings may be mapped to points in a discrete phenotype space based on similarity in antigenic structure. Cross-immunity between strains, that is the reduction in susceptibility to strain A conferred to a host by infection with strain B, can then be defined for pairs of points in the antigenic space by a specified function. Analysis of an SIR type model shows that, if two strains are at equilibrium, the shape of the cross-immunity function has a strong influence on the invasion and coexistence of a third strain and, consequently, the expected evolutionary pathway. A function that is constant except for discontinuities at the end points is expected to result in the accumulation of diversity until a pair of discordant strains occurs that can, depending on parameter values, exclude all other strains. For a function of the form f (h) = hq, where h is the antigenic distance between two strains, invasion and coexistence is always possible if q ≤ 1 and little antigenic structure is expected in the pathogen population. However, if q > 1 invasion and coexistence may be impossible, depending on parameter values, and the pathogen population is expected to show significant antigenic structuring. In addition to illuminating the role of cross-immunity in pathogen evolution, this analysis indicates that the choice of cross-immunity function, the representation of immunity acquired from multiple previous infections and the number of elements used to characterize the antigenic space must be carefully considered in the development and interpretation of more sophisticated models of pathogen dynamics and evolution. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {We consider models of the interactions between human population dynamics and cultural evolution, asking whether they predict sustainable or unsustainable patterns of growth. Phenomenological models predict either unsustainable population growth or stabilization in the near future. The latter prediction, however, is based on extrapolation of current demographic trends and does not take into account causal processes of demographic and cultural dynamics. Most existing causal models assume (or derive from simplified models of the economy) a positive feedback between cultural evolution and demographic growth, and predict unlimited growth in both culture and population. We augment these models taking into account that: (1) cultural transmission is not perfect, i.e., culture can be lost; (2) culture does not always promote population growth. We show that taking these factors into account can cause radically different model behavior, such as population extinction rather than stability, and extinction rather than growth. We conclude that all models agree that a population capable of maintaining a large amount of culture, including a powerful technology, runs a high risk of being unsustainable. We suggest that future work must address more explicitly both the dynamics of resource consumption and the cultural evolution of beliefs implicated in reproductive behavior (e.g., ideas about the preferred family size) and in resource use (e.g., environmentalist stances). © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

We explore here the effects of distributed development on the stability of these systems, for a random parasitism model incorporating an invulnerable host stage, and a negative binomial model that displays generation cycles. A shifted gamma distribution was used to model the distribution of development time for both host and parasitoid stages, using the range of parameter values suggested by a literature survey. For the random parasitism model, the addition of biologically plausible levels of developmental variability could potentially double the area of stable parameter space beyond that generated by the invulnerable host stage. Only variability in host development time was stabilizing in this model. For the negative binomial model, development variability reduced the likelihood of generation cycles, and variability in host and parasitoid was equally stabilizing. One source of stability in these models may be aggregation of risk, because hosts with varying development times have different vulnerabilities. High levels of variability in development time occur in many insects and so could be a common source of stability in host-parasitoid systems. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

We model organism movement using a diffusion framework in which the foraging population is divided into two subpopulations engaged in intensive and extensive search modes respectively. Movement in the intensive search mode (ISM) is modeled by diffusion, and movement in the extensive search mode (ESM) is modeled by advection. We show that our model provides a superior fit to organism movement data than more traditional diffusion or diffusion-advection models in which the forager population is considered homogeneous.

	abstract = {Although perturbations from a stable equilibrium must ultimately vanish, they can grow initially, and the maximum initial growth rate is called reactivity. Reactivity thus identifies systems that may undergo transient population surges or drops in response to perturbations; however, we lack biological and mathematical intuition about what makes a system reactive. This paper presents upper and lower bounds on reactivity for an arbitrary linearized model, explores their strictness, and discusses their biological implications. I find that less stable systems (i.e. systems with long transients) have a smaller possible range of reactivities for which no perturbations grow. Systems with more species have a higher capacity to be reactive, assuming species interactions do not weaken too rapidly as the number of species increases. Finally, I find that in discrete time, reactivity is determined largely by mean interaction strength and neither discrete nor continuous time reactivity are sensitive to food web topology. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

For the scalings that take the genetic-drift into account, the continuous model is given by a singular diffusion equation, together with two conservation laws that are already present at the discrete level. For scalings that take into account only natural selection, we obtain a hyperbolic singular equation that embeds the Replicator Dynamics and satisfies only one conservation law.

	abstract = {Metapopulation extinction risk is the probability that all local populations are simultaneously extinct during a fixed time frame. Dispersal may reduce a metapopulation's extinction risk by raising its average per-capita growth rate. By contrast, dispersal may raise a metapopulation's extinction risk by reducing its average population density. Which effect prevails is controlled by habitat fragmentation. Dispersal in mildly fragmented habitat reduces a metapopulation's extinction risk by raising its average per-capita growth rate without causing any appreciable drop in its average population density. By contrast, dispersal in severely fragmented habitat raises a metapopulation's extinction risk because the rise in its average per-capita growth rate is more than offset by the decline in its average population density. The metapopulation model used here shows several other interesting phenomena. Dispersal in sufficiently fragmented habitat reduces a metapopulation's extinction risk to that of a constant environment. Dispersal between habitat fragments reduces a metapopulation's extinction risk insofar as local environments are asynchronous. Grouped dispersal raises the effective habitat fragmentation level. Dispersal search barriers raise metapopulation extinction risk. Nonuniform dispersal may reduce the effective fraction of suitable habitat fragments below the extinction threshold. Nonuniform dispersal may make demographic stochasticity a more potent metapopulation extinction force than environmental stochasticity. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

We measured the number, cycle length and domains of attraction of the various attractors produced by the model. The domains of attraction tended to be smaller, and the cycles longer, for systems with larger number of alleles. Fitnesses that parametrized negative frequency-dependent selection were more likely to allow cycling, and these cycles also had larger domains of attraction. Aperiodic trajectories were detected only in cases with 4 or 5 alleles. The genetic cycles produced by the model do not have periods as short as those predicted in ecological models with cycling (such as predator-prey population cycles, etc.). Consequently, in a real-world system, PIM allele-frequency cycling is likely to be indistinguishable from stable equilibria when observed over short time scales. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {For the Levene model with soft selection in two demes, the maintenance of polymorphism at two diallelic loci is studied. Selection is nonepistatic and dominance is intermediate. Thus, there is directional selection in every deme and at every locus. We assume that selection is in opposite directions in the two demes because otherwise no polymorphism is possible. If at one locus there is no dominance, then a complete analysis of the dynamical and equilibrium properties is performed. In particular, a simple necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of an internal equilibrium and sufficient conditions for global asymptotic stability are obtained. These results are extended to deme-independent degree of dominance at one locus. A perturbation analysis establishes structural stability within the full parameter space. In the absence of genotype-environment interaction, which requires deme-independent dominance at both loci, nongeneric equilibrium behavior occurs, and the introduction of arbitrarily small genotype-environment interaction changes the equilibrium structure and may destroy stable polymorphism. The volume of the parameter space for which a (stable) two-locus polymorphism is maintained is computed numerically. It is investigated how this volume depends on the strength of selection and on the dominance relations. If the favorable allele is (partially) dominant in its deme, more than 20% of all parameter combinations lead to a globally asymptotically stable, fully polymorphic equilibrium. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Our analysis allows us to make two main technical points. First, we present a method to define invasion fitness in class-structured viscous populations, which allows us to apply adaptive dynamics methodology. Second, we show that ordinary pair approximation introduces an important quantitative bias in the evolutionary model, even on random networks. We propose a correction to the ordinary pair approximation that yields quantitative accuracy, and discuss how the bias associated with this approach is precisely what allows us to identify subtle aspects associated with the evolutionary dynamics of spatially structured populations. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

I study the effects of environmental change on the evolution of the effectiveness and accuracy of individual and social learning (individual and social learning levels) and the number of pieces of information learned individually and socially (individual and social learning capacities) by analyzing a mathematical model. I show that individual learning capacity decreases and social learning capacity increases when the environment becomes more stable; both decrease when the environment becomes milder. I also show that individual learning capacity increases when individual learning level increases or social learning level decreases, while social learning capacity increases when individual or social learning level increases. The evolution of high learning levels can be triggered when the environment becomes severe, but a high social learning level can evolve only when a high individual learning level can simultaneously evolve with it. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Evolutionary branching has been suggested as a mechanism to explain ecological speciation processes. Recent studies indicate however that demographic stochasticity and environmental fluctuations may prevent branching through stochastic competitive exclusion. Here we extend previous theory in several ways; we use a more mechanistic ecological model, we incorporate environmental fluctuations in a more realistic way and we include environmental autocorrelation in the analysis. We present a single, comprehensible analytical result which summarizes most effects of environmental fluctuations on evolutionary branching driven by resource competition. Corroborating earlier findings, we show that branching may be delayed or impeded if the underlying resources have uncorrelated or negatively correlated responses to environmental fluctuations. There is also a strong impeding effect of positive environmental autocorrelation, which can be related to results from recent experiments on adaptive radiation in bacterial microcosms. In addition, we find that environmental fluctuations can lead to cycles of repeated branching and extinction. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Using the example of rhizobia-legume interaction, the relationships were studied between EMS and Functional Integrity of Symbiosis (FIS) which is represented as a measure for concordance of changes in the partners' genotypic frequencies under the environmental fluctuations represented by the minor deviations of the systemic model parameters. The FIS indices correlate positively with EMS values suggesting an enhancement of FIS via the natural selection operating in the partners' populations in favor of high EMS. Due to this selection, nodular habitats may be closed for colonization by the non-beneficial bacterial strains and the Genotypic Specificity of Mutualism (GSM) in partners' interactions is enhanced: the selective advantage of host-specific vs non-host-specific mutualists is increasing. The novelty of our model is to suggest a selective background for macroevolutionary events reorganizing the structure and functions of symbiotic systems and to present its evolution as a result of shifting the equilibrium between different types of mutualists under the impacts of the symbiosis-stipulated modes of natural selection. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

There are, nevertheless, few results on multilocus models when both random genetic drift and natural selection affect the evolutionary dynamics. In this paper we describe a formalism to calculate systematic perturbation expansions of moments of allelic states around neutrality in populations of constant size. This allows us to evaluate multilocus fixation probabilities (long-term limits of the moments) under arbitrary strength of selection and gene action. We show that such fixation probabilities can be expressed in terms of selection coefficients weighted by mean first passages times of ancestral gene lineages within a single ancestor. These passage times extend the coalescence times that weight selection coefficients in one-locus perturbation formulas for fixation probabilities. We then apply these results to investigate the Hill-Robertson effect and the coevolution of helping and punishment. Finally, we discuss limitations and strengths of the perturbation approach. In particular, it provides accurate approximations for fixation probabilities for weak selection regimes only (N s ≤ 1), but it provides generally good prediction for the direction of selection under frequency-dependent selection. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Comparison of simulation results for random mating with those for a harem system (locally, a single male sires all offspring) reveal that even extreme variance in local male reproductive success (extreme male competition) does not induce male-biased dispersal. The latter evolves if the between-patch variance in reproductive success is larger for males than females. This can emerge due to demographic stochasticity if the habitat patches are small. More generally, members of a group of individuals experiencing higher spatio-temporal variance in fitness expectations may evolve to disperse with greater probability than others. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {Diffusion is one of the most frequently used assumptions to explain dispersal. Diffusion models and in particular reaction-diffusion equations usually lead to solutions moving at constant speeds, too slow compared to observations. As early as 1899, Reid had found that the rate of spread of tree species migrating to northern environments at the beginning of the Holocene was too fast to be explained by diffusive dispersal. Rapid spreading is generally explained using long distance dispersal events, modelled through integro-differential equations (IDEs) with exponentially unbounded (EU) kernels, i.e. decaying slower than any exponential. We show here that classical reaction-diffusion models of the Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piskunov type can produce patterns of colonisation very similar to those of IDEs, if the initial population is EU at the beginning of the considered colonisation event. Many similarities between reaction-diffusion models with EU initial data and IDEs with EU kernels are found; in particular comparable accelerating rates of spread and flattening of the solutions. There was previously no systematic mathematical theory for such reaction-diffusion models with EU initial data. Yet, EU initial data can easily be understood as consequences of colonisation-retraction events and lead to fast spreading and accelerating rates of spread without the long distance hypothesis. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

I show first, that incorporating neutral mutations significantly increases the number of point mutations in a given evolutionary walk when compared to estimates from previous adaptive walk models. Second, that incorporating neutral mutants into such a walk significantly increases the final fitness encountered on that walk - indeed evolutionary walks including neutral steps often reach the global optimum in this model. Third, and perhaps most importantly, evolutionary paths of this kind are often extremely winding in their nature and have the potential to undergo multiple mutations at a given sequence position within a single walk; the potential of these winding paths to mislead phylogenetic reconstruction is briefly considered. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

Within this algorithm we compute, for two individuals randomly sampled from the population, the correlation between times to the most recent common ancestor and the linkage probability corresponding to two different loci with recombination rate R between them. These quantities characterise the linkage between the two loci in question. We find that the sequential Markov coalescent method approximates the coalescent well in general in models with demographic structure. An exception is the case where individuals are sampled from populations separated by reduced gene flow. In this situation, the correlations may be significantly underestimated.

	abstract = {Feldman and Karlin conjectured that the number of isolated fixed points for deterministic models of viability selection and recombination among n possible haplotypes has an upper bound of 2n - 1. Here a proof is provided. The upper bound of 3n - 1 obtained by Lyubich et al. (2001) using Bézout's Theorem (1779) is reduced here to 2n through a change of representation that reduces the third-order polynomials to second order. A further reduction to 2n - 1 is obtained using the homogeneous representation of the system, which yields always one solution 'at infinity'. While the original conjecture was made for systems of selection and recombination, the results here generalize to viability selection with any arbitrary system of bi-parental transmission, which includes recombination and mutation as special cases. An example is constructed of a mutation-selection system that has 2n - 1 fixed points given any n, which shows that 2n - 1 is the sharpest possible upper bound that can be found for the general space of selection and transmission coefficients. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {Dispersal is a key mechanism to help populations propagate across space and thus is important in helping to understand spatial patterns. However, it is often difficult to quantify empirically as it requires intensive and detailed field study. Here we describe a method for estimating the effective dispersal distance of tropical plant populations. The method integrates a simple spatially explicit, individual-based dynamic model and spatial statistical analysis. The model is partly parameterized from spatial point pattern data as well as time series data from a 50 ha tropical forest plot in Barro Colorado Island (BCI) in Panama. Correlation between our estimated dispersal distances and those from inverse modeling based on field studies to date on BCI raises some questions about the match between our methods and those previously used. The method we propose can be generalized to any population for which spatial point pattern data are available. Additional field studies would be useful to further validate our method.

For larger values of the timescale of the young trees the two-dimensional approximation breaks down, and a broader parameter interval with mixed-mode oscillations appear, replacing the simple canard explosion. The analysis only relies on simple and generic properties of the model, and is expected to be applicable in a larger class of multiple timescale dynamical models. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

This fact has been exploited successfully in the use of the Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV) to better control wild-type polio viruses. In this work we analyze general LAVV vaccination models for infections that confer lifelong immunity. We consider both standard (continuous) vaccination strategies and pulse vaccination programs (where mass vaccination is carried out at regular intervals). For continuous vaccination, we provide a complete global analysis of a very general compartmental ordinary differential equation LAVV model. We find that the threshold vaccination level required for the eradication of wild-type virus depends on the basic reproduction numbers of both the wild-type and vaccine viruses, but is otherwise independent of the distributions of the durations in each of the sequence of stages of disease progression (e.g., latent, infectious, etc.). Furthermore, even for vaccine viruses with reproduction numbers below one, which would naturally fade from the population upon cessation of vaccination, there can be a significant reduction in the threshold vaccination level. The dependence of the threshold vaccination level on the virus reproduction numbers largely generalizes to the pulse vaccination model. For shorter pulsing periods there is negligible difference in threshold vaccination level as compared to continuous vaccination campaigns. Thus, we conclude that current policy in many countries to employ annual pulsed OPV vaccination does not significantly diminish the benefits of contact vaccination. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Food production requires labor; thus, dependence of survival and fertility on food involves dependence of a population's future on its current state. We use a perturbation approach to analyze the effects of random environmental variation on this nonlinear, age-structured system. We show that in expanding populations, direct environmental effects dominate induced population fluctuations, so environmental variability has little effect on mean hunger levels, although it does decrease population growth. The growth rate determines the time until population is limited by space. This limitation introduces a tradeoff between population density and well-being, so population effects become more important than the direct effects of the environment: environmental fluctuation increases mortality, releasing density dependence and raising average well-being for survivors. We discuss the social implications of these findings for the long-term fate of populations as they transition from expansion into limitation, given that conditions leading to high well-being during growth depress well-being during limitation. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Communication is also dichotomized according to whether individuals are innately able to send and receive relevant signals or they have to acquire those signals culturally. We develop two-locus haploid models that represent the coevolutionary nature of the evolution of communication, and derive the conditions under which communicators can invade a population of non-communicators and those under which a population of communicators is evolutionarily stable against the invasion by non-communicators for each of the three classes of communication. Analysis of the models reveals that interaction among siblings enables the invasion of communication and that the optimal probability of interaction with siblings depends on the class of communication and the mode of signal transmission. In addition, cultural exploiting communication is more likely to invade a population of non-communicators than is genetic exploiting communication under certain circumstances. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {The maintenance of genetic variation in a spatially heterogeneous environment has been one of the main research themes in theoretical population genetics. Despite considerable progress in understanding the consequences of spatially structured environments on genetic variation, many problems remain unsolved. One of them concerns the relationship between the number of demes, the degree of dominance, and the maximum number of alleles that can be maintained by selection in a subdivided population. In this work, we study the potential of maintaining genetic variation in a two-deme model with deme-independent degree of intermediate dominance, which includes absence of G x E interaction as a special case. We present a thorough numerical analysis of a two-deme three-allele model, which allows us to identify dominance and selection patterns that harbor the potential for stable triallelic equilibria. The information gained by this approach is then used to construct an example in which existence and asymptotic stability of a fully polymorphic equilibrium can be proved analytically. Noteworthy, in this example the parameter range in which three alleles can coexist is maximized for intermediate migration rates. Our results can be interpreted in a specialist-generalist context and (among others) show when two specialists can coexist with a generalist in two demes if the degree of dominance is deme independent and intermediate. The dominance relation between the generalist allele and the specialist alleles play a decisive role. We also discuss linear selection on a quantitative trait and show that G x E interaction is not necessary for the maintenance of more than two alleles in two demes. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

For two-species discrete-time competition and predator-prey models, we use this concept to find broad easily checked sufficient conditions for the rigorous concept of permanent coexistence. With these results, permanent coexistence becomes a tractable concept for many discrete-time population models. To understand how these conditions apply to nonpoint attractors, we generalize the concept of relative nonlinearity and use it to show how population fluctuations affect the long-term low-density growth rate ("the invasion rate") of a species when it is invading the system consisting of the other species ("the resident") at a single-species attractor. The concept of relative nonlinearity defines circumstances when this invasion rate is increased or decreased by resident population fluctuations arising from a nonpoint attractor. The presence and sign of relative nonlinearity is easily checked in models of interacting species. When relative nonlinearity is zero or positive, fluctuations cannot decrease the invasion rate. It follows that permanence is then determined by invasibility of the resident's fixed points. However, when relative nonlinearity is negative, invasibility, and hence permanent coexistence, can be undermined by resident population fluctuations. These results are illustrated with specific two-species competition and predator-prey models of generic forms. © 2010.},

The selected case study concerns colon and rectum cancer, which originates in colorectal crypts. Cells inside the crypts are assumed to be organized according to a compartmental-like arrangement and to be homogeneously mixing. A mathematical model for cancer progression is proposed here. This model describes the generation of multiple clonal sub-populations of cells at different progression stages in a single crypt. Asymptotic analysis and simulations are developed with an exploratory aim. The obtained results offer some insights into the role played by mutation, proliferation and differentiation phenomena on cancer dynamics. In particular, the acquisition of an additional growing power and a reduction for cellular differentiation seem more likely to be the driving force behind carcinogenesis rather than an increase in the mutation rate. The mutation rate instead seems to affect progression dynamics and intra-tumor heterogeneity. The role played by cells, at different differentiation stages, in the onset and progression of colorectal cancer is highlighted. The results support the fact that stem cells play a key role in cancer development and the idea that transit-amplifying cells could also take on an active role in carcinogenesis. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

Convergence to a structured coalescent process results when assuming that migration follows a coalescent timescale which can be much shorter than the usual Wright-Fisher timescale. Three different limit processes are possible depending on the coalescent timescale, two of which allow multiple mergers of ancestral lines. The expected time to most recent common ancestor, and the expected total size of the genealogy, of balanced and unbalanced samples can be very similar, even when migration is low, if the coalescent process allows multiple mergers.

	abstract = {Evolution and the maintenance of polymorphism under the multilocus Levene model with soft selection are studied. The number of loci and alleles, the number of demes, the linkage map, and the degree of dominance are arbitrary, but epistasis is absent or weak. We prove that, without epistasis and under mild, generic conditions, every trajectory converges to a stationary point in linkage equilibrium. Consequently, the equilibrium and stability structure can be determined by investigating the much simpler gene-frequency dynamics on the linkage-equilibrium manifold. For a haploid species an analogous result is shown. For weak epistasis, global convergence to quasi-linkage equilibrium is established. As an application, the maintenance of multilocus polymorphism is explored if the degree of dominance is intermediate at every locus and epistasis is absent or weak. If there are at least two demes, then arbitrarily many multiallelic loci can be maintained polymorphic at a globally asymptotically stable equilibrium. Because this holds for an open set of parameters, such equilibria are structurally stable. If the degree of dominance is not only intermediate but also deme independent, and loci are diallelic, an open set of parameters yielding an internal equilibrium exists only if the number of loci is strictly less than the number of demes. Otherwise, a fully polymorphic equilibrium exists only nongenerically, and if it exists, it consists of a manifold of equilibria. Its dimension is determined. In the absence of genotype-by-environment interaction, however, a manifold of equilibria occurs for an open set of parameters. In this case, the equilibrium structure is not robust to small deviations from no genotype-by-environment interaction. In a quantitative-genetic setting, the assumptions of no epistasis and intermediate dominance are equivalent to assuming that in every deme directional selection acts on a trait that is determined additively, i.e., by nonepistatic loci with dominance. Some of our results are exemplified in this quantitative-genetic context. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

The model quantifies the sources of mortality in these classical problems into vitality-dependent and independent parts, and characterizes the vitality-dependent part in terms of initial and evolving heterogeneities. Three temporal scales express the balance of these factors: a time scale of death from senescence, a time scale of accidental mortality and a crossover time between evolving vs. initial heterogeneity.

Unconditional cooperators who help others at a cost to themselves are exploited by defectors who enjoy the benefits without any help in return. It has been argued that cooperation can be established in repeated dyadic interactions if cooperators punish defectors by withholding future cooperation. In social interactions involving more than two individuals, however, withholding future cooperation may result in penalizing not only defectors but also other cooperators. Hence, in such social interactions, it is unclear whether cooperation is most likely to evolve when cooperators are intolerant of any defectors. Here we show, by analyzing a stochastic model of n-player Prisoner's Dilemma, that the evolution of cooperation can be more likely when cooperators tolerate some defection than when they have no such generosity. We also specify the optimal level of generosity that most likely facilitates the evolution of cooperation. © 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Partial panmixia can be regarded as the limiting case of long-distance migration. The effect of incorporating partial panmixia into neutral models of geographical variation is investigated. The monoecious, diploid population is subdivided into randomly mating colonies that exchange gametes independently of genotype. The gametes fuse wholly at random, including self-fertilization. Generations are discrete and nonoverlapping; the analysis is restricted to a single locus; every allele mutates to new alleles at the same rate. Introducing some panmixia intensifies sufficiently weak migration. A general formula is derived for the migration effective population number, Ne, and Ne is evaluated explicitly in a number of models with nonconservative migration. Usually, Ne increases as the panmictic rate, b, increases; in particular, this result holds for two demes, and generically if the underlying migration is either sufficiently weak or panmixia is sufficiently strong. However, in an analytic model, there exists an open set of parameters for which Ne decreases as b increases. Migration is conservative in the island and circular-habitat models, which are studied in detail. In the former, including some panmixia simply alters the underlying migration rate, increasing (decreasing) it if it is less (greater) than the panmictic value. For the circular habitat, the probability of identity in allelic state at equilibrium is calculated in a nonlocal, continuous-space, continuous-time approximation. In both models, by an efficient, general method, the expected homozygosity, effective number of alleles, and differentiation of gene frequencies are evaluated and discussed; their monotonicity properties with respect to all the parameters are determined; and in the model of infinitely many sites, the mean coalescence times and nucleotide diversities are studied similarly. For the probability of identity at equilibrium in the unbounded stepping-stone model in arbitrarily many dimensions, introducing some panmixia merely replaces the mutation rate by a larger parameter. If the average probability of identity is initially zero, as for identity by descent, then the same conclusion holds for all time. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

Directed social learning protects them from copying non-adaptive information. So far, the strategies of animals, leading to directed social learning, are assumed to rely on (possibly indirect) inferences about the demonstrator's success. As an alternative to this assumption, we propose a strategy that only uses self-established estimates of the pay-offs of behavior. We evaluate the strategy in a number of agent-based simulations. Critically, the strategy's success is warranted by the inclusion of an incremental learning mechanism. Our findings point out new theoretical opportunities to regulate social learning for animals. More broadly, our simulations emphasize the need to include a realistic learning mechanism in game-theoretic studies of social learning strategies, and call for re-evaluation of previous findings. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The impacts of such asymmetries on metapopulation persistence are seldom considered, especially rarely in theoretical studies. Considering three classical models (the island, the stepping stone and the distance-dependent model), we explore how metapopulation persistence is affected by (i) asymmetry in dispersal strength, in which the colonization rate between two patches differs in direction, and (ii) asymmetry in connectivity, in which the overall colonization pattern displays asymmetry (circulating or dendritic networks). Viability can be drastically reduced when directional bias in dispersal strength is higher than 25%. Re-colonization patterns that allow for strong local connectivity provide the highest persistence compared to systems that allow circulation. Finally, asymmetry has relatively weak effects when metapopulations maintain strong general connectivity. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

The protozoa Toxoplasma gondii may be transmitted to DHs either via predation of infected IHs through a complex life cycle (CLC) or directly from a contaminated environment through a simple life cycle (SLC). This parasite is also present in contrasting host density environments. We tested the hypothesis that the relative contributions of the CLC and SLC along an urban-rural gradient depend on the IH supply. We built and analysed a deterministic model of the T. gondii transmission cycle. The SLC relative contribution is important only in urban-type environments, i.e., with low predation rate on IHs. In contrast, the parasite is predominantly transmitted through a CLC in suburban and rural environments. The association of the two cycles enables the parasite to spread in situations of low IH availability and low DH population size for which each cycle alone is insufficient. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

Most introgression studies ignore these random effects, and consequently fail to accurately assess the risk of introgression. This paper presents a methodology for quantifying stochastic introgression processes, based on multitype branching process models.

Furthermore, continuous transitions between different community compositions can become discontinuous and bistability or tristability can occur.

While much experimental effort is being devoted to the identification of the functional effects of individual mutations, mathematical modeling of tumor progression generally considers constant fitness increments as mutations are accumulated.

Assumptions regarding migration type (e.g. source-sink, resident pre-emption, or balanced dispersal) and patterns (e.g. stepping-stone versus island dispersal) have large impacts when demes differ in sizes or selective pressures. The effects of fragmentation, as well as the spatial localization of newly arising mutations, also strongly depend on migration type and patterns. Migration rate also matters: depending on the migration type, fixation probabilities at an intermediate migration rate may lie outside the range defined by the low- and high-migration limits when demes differ in sizes. Given the extreme sensitivity of fixation probability to characteristics of dispersal, we underline the importance of making explicit (and documenting empirically) the crucial ecological/ behavioral assumptions underlying migration models. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Spatially explicit models relating to plant populations have developed little since Felsenstein (1975) pointed out that if limited seed dispersal causes clustering of individuals, such models cannot reach an equilibrium. This paper aims to resolve this issue by modifying the Neyman-Scott cluster point process. The new point processes are dynamic models with random immigration, and the continuous increase in the clustering of individuals stops at some level. Hence, an equilibrium state is achieved, and new individual-based spatially explicit neutral coalescent models are established. By fitting the spatial structure at equilibrium to individual spatial distribution data, we can indirectly estimate seed dispersal and effective population density. These estimates are improved when genetic data are available, and become even more sophisticated if spatial distribution and genetic data pertaining to the offspring are also available. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The model produces a catalog of central place effects predicting how distance from a central place influences the costs and benefits of foraging, load-size, quitting harvest rates, and giving-up densities. In the model, we separate between costs that are load-size dependent, i.e. a direct effect of the size of the load, and load-size independent effects, such as correlations between distance and patch qualities. We also distinguish between predictions of between- and within-environment comparisons. Foraging costs, giving-up densities and quitting harvest rates should almost always increase with distance with these effects amplified by increases in metabolic costs, predation risk and load-costs. With respect to load-size: when comparing foraging in patches within an environment, we should often expect smaller loads to be taken from distant patches (negative distance-load correlation). However, when comparing between environments, there should be a positive correlation between average distance and load-size. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

However, a cooperative strategy Tit for Tat (TFT0) that stops cooperation after the first iteration when there is at least one defector in the group, can invade a world of loners, even in sizable groups, if both the TFT0 and the defector strategies arise at the same frequency by mutation.},

We show how the pattern of diversification through the Cenozoic can be combined with a model for speciation to give a distribution for the age of the primates. The primate fossil record, the number of extant primate species, and information about the structure of the primate phylogenetic tree are combined to provide an estimate for the joint distribution of the primate and anthropoid divergence times. To take this information into account, we derive the structure of the birth-and-death process conditioned to have a subtree originate at a particular point in time. This process has a size-biased law and has an immortal line running from the root of the tree to the root of the subtree, with species on the spine having modified offspring and length distributions. We conclude that it is not possible, with this model, to rule out a Cretaceous origin for the primates. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Among the processes known to produce discord between single-gene phylogenies, two of the best studied in a phylogenetic context are hybridization and incomplete lineage sorting. Much recent attention has focused on the development of methods for estimating species phylogenies in the presence of incomplete lineage sorting, but phylogenetic models that allow for hybridization have been more limited. Here we propose a model that allows incongruence in single-gene phylogenies to be due to both hybridization and incomplete lineage sorting, with the goal of determining the contribution of hybridization to observed gene tree incongruence in the presence of incomplete lineage sorting. Using our model, we propose methods for estimating the extent of the role of hybridization in both a likelihood and a Bayesian framework.

	abstract = {The Public Goods Game is one of the most popular models for studying the origin and maintenance of cooperation. In its simplest form, this evolutionary game has two regimes: defection goes to fixation if the multiplication factor r is smaller than the interaction group size N, whereas cooperation goes to fixation if the multiplication factor r is larger than the interaction group size N. Hauert et al. [Hauert, C., Holmes, M., Doebeli, M., 2006a. Evolutionary games and population dynamics: Maintenance of cooperation in public goods games. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B 273, 2565-2570] have introduced the Ecological Public Goods Game by viewing the payoffs from the evolutionary game as birth rates in a population dynamic model. This results in a feedback between ecological and evolutionary dynamics: if defectors are prevalent, birth rates are low and population densities decline, which leads to smaller interaction groups for the Public Goods game, and hence to dominance of cooperators, with a concomitant increase in birth rates and population densities. This feedback can lead to stable co-existence between cooperators and defectors. Here we provide a detailed analysis of the dynamics of the Ecological Public Goods Game, showing that the model exhibits various types of bifurcations, including supercritical Hopf bifurcations, which result in stable limit cycles, and hence in oscillatory co-existence of cooperators and defectors. These results show that including population dynamics in evolutionary games can have important consequences for the evolutionary dynamics of cooperation. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

For the basic model, we present new analysis on the existence and stability of equilibria. Then, we use numerical simulations of the model to illustrate the behavior of the system. We apply the model to Canadian reported data on tuberculosis and observe a good agreement between the model prediction and the data. For the extended model, which incorporated the recruitment of the latent and infectious in immigrants to the basic model, we find that the usual threshold condition does not apply and a unique equilibrium exists for all parameter values. This indicates that the disease does not disappear and becomes endemic in host areas. This finding is also supported by numerical simulations with the extended model. Our study suggests that immigrants have a considerable influence on the overall transmission dynamics behavior of tuberculosis. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The problem of density dependence appears in all approaches to the modelling of population dynamics. It is pertinent to classic models (i.e., Lotka-Volterra's), and also population genetics and game theoretical models related to the replicator dynamics. There is no density dependence in the classic formulation of replicator dynamics, which means that population size may grow to infinity. Therefore the question arises: How is unlimited population growth suppressed in frequency-dependent models? Two categories of solutions can be found in the literature. In the first, replicator dynamics is independent of background fitness. In the second type of solution, a multiplicative suppression coefficient is used, as in a logistic equation. Both approaches have disadvantages. The first one is incompatible with the methods of life history theory and basic probabilistic intuitions. The logistic type of suppression of per capita growth rate stops trajectories of selection when population size reaches the maximal value (carrying capacity); hence this method does not satisfy selective neutrality. To overcome these difficulties, we must explicitly consider turn-over of individuals dependent on mortality rate. This new approach leads to two interesting predictions. First, the equilibrium value of population size is lower than carrying capacity and depends on the mortality rate. Second, although the phase portrait of selection trajectories is the same as in density-independent replicator dynamics, pace of selection slows down when population size approaches equilibrium, and then remains constant and dependent on the rate of turn-over of individuals. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The random walk or diffusive approach to dispersal has yielded important results for biology and mathematics, yet it has been inadequate in explaining all phenomenological features. Ranges can terminate non-smoothly absent a complementary shift in the characteristics of the environment. Also unexplained is the absence of a species from nearby areas of adequate, or even abundant, resources. In this paper, I show how local searching behavior-keyed to a density-dependent fitness-can limit the speed and extent of a species' spread. In contrast to standard diffusive processes, pseudo-rational movement facilitates the clustering of populations. It also can be used to estimate the speed of an expanding population range, explain expansion stall, and provides a mechanism by which a population can colonize seemingly removed regions - biogeographic islands in a continental framework. Finally, I discuss the effect of resource degradation and different resource impact/utilization curves on the model. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {We constructed a reaction-diffusion model of the development of resistance to transgenic insecticidal Bt crops in pest populations. Kostitzin's demo-genetic model describes local interactions between three competing pest genotypes with alleles conferring resistance or susceptibility to transgenic plants, the spatial spread of insects being modelled by diffusion. This new approach makes it possible to combine a spatial demographic model of population dynamics with classical genetic theory. We used this model to examine the effects of pest dispersal and of the size and shape of the refuge on the efficiency of the "high-dose/refuge" strategy, which was designed to prevent the development of resistance in populations of insect pests, such as the European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis Hübner (Lepidoptera, Crambidae). We found that, with realistic combinations of refuge size and pest dispersal, the development of resistance could be considerably delayed. With a small to medium-sized farming area, contiguous refuge plots are more efficient than a larger number of smaller refuge patches. We also show that the formal coupling of classical Fisher-Haldane-Wright population genetics equations with diffusion terms inaccurately describes the development of resistance in a spatially heterogeneous pest population, notably overestimating the speed with which Bt resistance is selected in populations of pests targeted by Bt crops. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

We constructed a spatially-explicit simulation model to explore how predator and prey behavioral traits and patterns of resource distribution influence spatial overlap between predators, prey, and prey resources. Predator and prey spatial association primarily followed the ideal free distribution. Departures from this model were intriguing, especially from the interactions of predator and prey behavior. When prey weakly avoided conspecifics, they associated more highly with resources when predators were present. Predators increased the rate of prey movement between patches, which increased their ability to sample their environment and aggregate in patches with high resources. When prey strongly avoided each other, predators decreased prey association with resources. That is, an increased rate of prey movement increased the probability that prey would interact and avoid each other without regard to the distribution of resources. More generally, a more highly clumped distribution of resources acted as a spatial anchor that generally increased prey, predator, and resource association. Prey tended to congregate with resources and predators generally congregated with prey. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Stochasticity in the metapopulation and landscape dynamics gives negative contributions to patch occupancy, the former being more important at high occupancy and the latter at low occupancy. Positive landscape correlations always benefit the metapopulation, but are only significant when the correlation length is comparable to, or smaller than, the dispersal range. Our analytical results allow us to consider the importance of spatial kernels in all generality. We find that the shape of the landscape correlation function is typically unimportant, and that the variance is overwhelmingly the most important property of the colonisation kernel. However, short-range singularities in either the colonisation kernel or landscape correlations can give rise to qualitatively different behaviour. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The most common explanations have been the Moran effect (synchronous external stochastic influences) and the effect of dispersal among populations. Since ecological systems are typically subject to large spatially varying perturbations which destroy synchrony, a plausible mechanism explaining synchrony must produce rapid convergence to synchrony. We analyze the dynamics through time of the synchronizing effects of dispersal and, consequently, determine whether dispersal can be the mechanism which produces synchrony. Specifically, using methods new to ecology, we analyze a two patch predator-prey model, with identical weak dispersal between the patches. We find that a difference in time scales (i.e. one population has dynamics occurring much faster than the other) between the predator and prey species is the most important requirement for fast convergence to synchrony. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Using a perturbation method for processes with multiple time scales, we show that as the number of demes tends to infinity, the overall frequency converges to a diffusion process that is also the diffusion approximation for a finite, panmictic population subject to temporally fluctuating selection. We find that the coefficients of this process have a complicated dependence on deme size and migration rate, and that changes in these demographic parameters can determine both the balance between the dispersive and stabilizing effects of environmental variation and whether selection favors alleles with lower or higher fitness variance. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {Antagonistic coevolution between hosts and parasites is known to affect selection on recombination in hosts. The Red Queen Hypothesis (RQH) posits that genetic shuffling is beneficial for hosts because it quickly creates resistant genotypes. Indeed, a large body of theoretical studies have shown that for many models of the genetic interaction between host and parasite, the coevolutionary dynamics of hosts and parasites generate selection for recombination or sexual reproduction. Here we investigate models in which the effect of the host on the parasite (and vice versa) depend approximately multiplicatively on the number of matched alleles. Contrary to expectation, these models generate a dynamical behavior that strongly selects against recombination/sex. We investigate this atypical behavior analytically and numerically. Specifically we show that two complementary equilibria are responsible for generating strong linkage disequilibria of opposite sign, which in turn causes strong selection against sex. The biological relevance of this finding stems from the fact that these phenomena can also be observed if hosts are attacked by two parasites that affect host fitness independently. Hence the role of the Red Queen Hypothesis in natural host parasite systems where infection by multiple parasites is the rule rather than the exception needs to be reevaluated. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Experiments suggest that in many cases the single patch dynamics of predator-prey or host-parasite systems is extinction prone, and stability is achieved only when the spatial structure of the population is expressed via desynchronization between patches. A few mechanisms have been suggested so far to explain the inability of dispersal to synchronize the system. Here we compare a recently discovered mechanism, based on the dependence of the angular velocity on the oscillation amplitude, with other, already known conditions for desynchronization. Using a toy model composed of diffusively coupled oscillators we suggest a classification scheme for stability mechanisms, a scheme that allows for either a priori (based on the system parameters) or a posteriori (based on local measurements) identification of the dominant process that yields desynchronization. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {Limited migration results in kin selective pressure on helping behaviors under a wide range of ecological, demographic and life-history situations. However, such genetically determined altruistic helping can evolve only when migration is not too strong and group size is not too large. Cultural inheritance of helping behaviors may allow altruistic helping to evolve in groups of larger size because cultural transmission has the potential to markedly decrease the variance within groups and augment the variance between groups. Here, we study the co-evolution of culturally inherited altruistic helping behaviors and two alternative cultural transmission rules for such behaviors. We find that conformist transmission, where individuals within groups tend to copy prevalent cultural variants (e.g., beliefs or values), has a strong adverse effect on the evolution of culturally inherited helping traits. This finding is at variance with the commonly held view that conformist transmission is a crucial factor favoring the evolution of altruistic helping in humans. By contrast, we find that under one-to-many transmission, where individuals within groups tend to copy a "leader" (or teacher), altruistic helping can evolve in groups of any size, although the cultural transmission rule itself hitchhikes rather weakly with a selected helping trait. Our results suggest that culturally determined helping behaviors are more likely to be driven by "leaders" than by popularity, but the emergence and stability of the cultural transmission rules themselves should be driven by some extrinsic factors.},

This model is among the most frequently cited papers on the topic of "dishonest" signaling and supports the view that signals may be "dishonest" as long as they are "honest on average". Using genetic algorithms, we demonstrate that another solution exists to the game, an evolutionarily stable set of Nash equilibria in which members of the set never signal and all donors give their resource. Payoffs to players using this set of strategies is greater those when playing the "dishonest" signaling ESS. We demonstrate that a random population is far more likely to evolve to this non-communicating strategy set than the "dishonest" signaling ESS. We also discuss the dynamics of biological game theory models and the advances of genetic algorithms as a heuristic solution method for these models. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {We present a mathematical model for malaria treatment and spread of drug resistance in an endemic population. The model considers treated humans that remain infectious for some time and partially immune humans who are also infectious to mosquitoes although their infectiousness is always less than their non immune counterparts. The model is formulated by considering delays in the latent periods in both mosquito and human populations and in the period within which partial immunity is lost. Qualitative analysis of the model including positivity and boundedness of solutions is performed. Analysis of the reproductive numbers shows that if the treated humans become immediately uninfectious to mosquitoes then treatment will always reduce the number of sensitive infections. If however treated humans are infectious then for treatment to effectively reduce the number of sensitive infections, the ratio of the infectious period of the treated humans to the infectious period of the untreated humans multiplied by the ratio of the transmission rate from a treated human to the transmission rate of an untreated human should be less than one. Our results show that the spread of drug resistance with treatment as a control strategy depends on the ratio of the infectious periods of treated and untreated humans and on the transmission rates from infectious humans with resistant and sensitive infections. Numerical analysis is performed to assess the effects of treatment on the spread of resistance and infection. The study provides insight into the possible intervention strategies to be employed in malaria endemic populations with resistant parasites by identifying important parameters. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

The common currency in the model is the production of food, on which age-specific rates of birth and death depend. There is a single non-trivial equilibrium population at which productivity balances caloric needs. One of the most powerful controls on equilibrium hunger level is fertility control. Gains against hunger are accompanied by decreases in population size. Increasing worker productivity does increase equilibrium population size but does not improve welfare at equilibrium.

The steady state solution applies to any constant fitness landscape under a dynamic of successive fixations, each of which occurs on the background of the population's most recent common ancestor. Because this dynamic neglects the effects of polymorphism in the population beyond the mutant allele under consideration, the steady state solution provides a decent approximation of evolutionary dynamics when the population mutation rate is low (N u ≪ 1). To demonstrate the method, I apply it to two examples: Fisher's geometric model (FGM), and a simple model of molecular evolution. Since recent papers have studied the steady state behavior of FGM under this dynamic, I analyze its behavior in detail and compare the results with previous work. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

In this work we analyze the role of allometric scaling of host vital and epidemiological rates in a Susceptible-Exposed-Infected (SEI) model. Our analysis shows that the transmission coefficient threshold for the disease to establish in the population scales allometrically (exponent = 0.45) with host size as well as the threshold at which limit cycles occur. In contrast, the threshold of the basic reproduction number for sustained oscillations to occur is independent of the host size and is always greater than 5. In the case of rabies, we show that the oscillation periods predicted by the model match those observed in the field for a wide range of host sizes. The population dynamics of the SEI model is also analyzed in the case of pathogens affecting multiple coexisting hosts with different body sizes. Our analyses show that the basic reproduction number for limit cycles to occur depends on the ratio between host sizes, that the oscillation period in a multihost community is set by the smaller species dynamics, and that intermediate interspecific disease transmission can stabilize the epidemic occurrence in wildlife communities. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

If aggressive interactions between the juveniles are not included in the model, evolution is simply optimizing, and the optimal reproductive strategy is always a single Dirac δ-peak within the season. If aggressive interactions between the juveniles are included, an evolutionarily stable strategy can consist of not only one or two δ-peaks, but also of continuous reproduction during the season.

We investigate the influence of different population demographies on the evolution of longevity, and show how these can be linked to adaptive radiations. We present a range of models to explore the intraspecific and interspecific density effects on longevity and, consequently, diversification. We show how the magnitude, type, and timing of mutation can also affect fitness, invasion and diversification. We argue that fitness of alternative strategies under a range of different demographic structures leads to flat, as opposed to rugged, landscapes and that these flat fitness surfaces are important in the evolution of lifespan and senescence. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {We investigate the effect of parasitoid phenology on host-parasitoid population cycles. Recent experimental research has shown that parasitized hosts can continue to interact with their unparasitized counterparts through competition. Parasitoid phenology, in particular the timing of emergence from the host, determines the duration of this competition. We construct a discrete-time host-parasitoid model in which within-generation dynamics associated with parasitoid timing is explicitly incorporated. We found that late-emerging parasitoids induce less severe, but more frequent, host outbreaks, independent of the choice of competition model. The competition experienced by the parasitized host reduces the parasitoids' numerical response to changes in host numbers, preventing the 'boom-bust' dynamics associated with more efficient parasitoids. We tested our findings against experimental data for the forest tent caterpillar (Malacosoma disstria Hübner) system, where a large number of consecutive years at a high host density is synonymous with severe forest damage.

	abstract = {Complex traits often involve interactions between different genetic loci. This can lead to sign epistasis, whereby mutations that are individually deleterious or neutral combine to confer a fitness benefit. In order to acquire the beneficial genotype, an asexual population must cross a fitness valley or plateau by first acquiring the deleterious or neutral intermediates. Here, we present a complete, intuitive theoretical description of the valley-crossing process across the full spectrum of possible parameter regimes. We calculate the rate at which a population crosses a fitness valley or plateau of arbitrary width, as a function of the mutation rates, the population size, and the fitnesses of the intermediates. We find that when intermediates are close to neutral, a large population can cross even wide fitness valleys remarkably quickly, so that valley-crossing dynamics may be common even when mutations that directly increase fitness are also possible. Thus the evolutionary dynamics of large populations can be sensitive to the structure of an extended region of the fitness landscape - the population may not take directly uphill paths in favor of paths across valleys and plateaus that lead eventually to fitter genotypes. In smaller populations, we find that below a threshold size, which depends on the width of the fitness valley and the strength of selection against intermediate genotypes, valley-crossing is much less likely and hence the evolutionary dynamics are less influenced by distant regions of the fitness landscape. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {Without the top-down effects and the external/physical forcing, a stable coexistence of two phytoplankton species under a single resource is impossible - a result well known from the principle of competitive exclusion. Here I demonstrate by analysis of a mathematical model that such a stable coexistence in a homogeneous media without any external factor would be possible, at least theoretically, provided (i) one of the two species is toxin producing thereby has an allelopathic effect on the other, and (ii) the allelopathic effect exceeds a critical level. The threshold level of allelopathy required for the coexistence has been derived analytically in terms of the parameters associated with the resource competition and the nutrient recycling. That the extra mortality of a competitor driven by allelopathy of a toxic species gives a positive feed back to the algal growth process through the recycling is explained. And that this positive feed back plays a pivotal role in reducing competition pressures and helping species succession in the two-species model is demonstrated. Based on these specific coexistence results, I introduce and explain theoretically the allelopathic effect of a toxic species as a 'pseudo-mixotrophy'-a mechanism of 'if you cannot beat them or eat them, just kill them by chemical weapons'. The impact of this mechanism of species succession by pseudo-mixotrophy in the form of alleopathy is discussed in the context of current understanding on straight mixotrophy and resource-species relationship among phytoplankton species. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

To analyze this model we use two different approaches: a discrete approach that is based on the Master equation for a one step jump process and a continuous approach based on the approximation of the discrete jump process with the Kolmogorov-Fokker-Planck forward and backward equations. The discrete and continuous approaches are applied to analyze the species abundance distributions and the time to species extinction. Moreover, with the aid of the continuous approach a realistic classification of the behavior of species in local communities is developed. The species abundance dynamics at the edge between two distinct habitats is compared with those located in the homogeneous interior habitats using species abundance distributions and the first time to species extinction. We show that the structure of the links between local community and the metacommunity plays an important role on species persistence. Specifically, species at the edge between two distinct metacommunities have higher extinction rate than those in the interior habitats connected only to one metacommunity. Moreover, the same species might be persistent in the homogeneous interior habitat, but its probability of extinction from the edge local community could be very high. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {The mathematical model for evolution of the plant-microbe facultative mutualistic interactions based on the partners' symbiotic feedbacks is constructed. Using the example of rhizobia-legume symbiosis, we addressed these feedbacks in terms of the metabolic (C ↔ N) exchange resulting in the parallel improvements of the partners' fitness (positive feedbacks). These improvements are correlated to the symbiotic efficiency dependent on the ratio of N2-fixing bacterial strains ("genuine mutualists") to the non- N2-fixing strains ("symbiotic cheaters") in the root nodules. The computer experiments demonstrated that an interplay between the frequency-dependent selection (FDS) and the Darwinian (frequency-independent) selection pressures implemented in the partners' populations ensures an anchoring or even domination for the newly generated host-specific mutualists (which form N2-fixing nodules only with one of two available plant genotypes) more successfully than for the non-host-specific mutualists (which form N2-fixing nodules with both plant genotypes). The created model allows us to consider the mutualistic symbiosis as a finely balanced polymorphic system wherein the equilibrium in bacterial population may be shifted in favor of "genuine mutualists" due to the partner-stipulated selection for an improved symbiotic efficiency implemented in the plant population. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {We explore the impact of plant toxicity on the dynamics of a plant-herbivore interaction, such as that of a mammalian browser and its plant forage species, by studying a mathematical model that includes a toxin-determined functional response. In this functional response, the traditional Holling Type 2 response is modified to include the negative effect of toxin on herbivore growth, which can overwhelm the positive effect of biomass ingestion at sufficiently high plant toxicant concentrations. Two types of consumption decisions of the herbivore are considered. One of these (Case 1) incorporates the adaptation of the herbivore to control its rate of consumption of plant items when that is likely to lead to levels of toxicity that more than offset the marginal gain to the herbivore of consuming more plant biomass, while the other (Case 2) simply assumes that, although the herbivore's rate of ingestion of plant biomass is negatively affected by increasing ingestion of toxicant relative to the load it can safely deal with, the herbivore is not able to prevent detrimental or even lethal levels of toxicant intake. A primary result of this work is that these differences in behavior lead to dramatically different outcomes, summarized in bifurcation diagrams. In Case 2, a wide variety of dynamics may occur due to the interplay of Holling Type 2 dynamics and the effect of the plant toxicant. These dynamics include the occurrence of bistability, in which both a periodic solution and the herbivore-extinction equilibrium are attractors, as well the possibility of a homoclinic bifurcation. Whether the herbivore goes to extinction in the bistable case depends on initial conditions of herbivore and plant biomasses. For relatively low herbivore resource acquisition rates, the toxicant effect increases the likelihood of 'paradox of enrichment' type limit cycle oscillations, but at higher resource acquisition rates, the toxicant may decrease the likelihood of these cycles. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Further, we analyse these relationships in the presence of biases in cultural learning and find that the introduction of new variants typically increases cultural diversity substantially in the short term, but may decrease long-term diversity. Independent invention generally supports higher levels of cultural diversity than refinement. Repeated patterns of innovation through refinement generate characteristic oscillating trends in diversity, with increasing trends towards greater average diversity observed for medium but not low innovation rates. Conformity weakens the relationship between innovation and diversity.

	abstract = {The first-order effect of selection on the probability of fixation of an allele, with respect to an intensity of selection s > 0 in a diploid population of fixed finite size N, undergoing discrete, non-overlapping generations, is shown to be given by the sum of the average effects of that allele on the coefficient of selection in the current generation and all future generations, given the population state in the current generation. This projected average allelic effect is a weighted sum of average allelic effects in allozygous and autozygous offspring in the initial generation, with weights given in terms of expected coalescence times, under neutrality, for the lineages of two or three gametes chosen at random in the same generation. This is shown in the framework of multiple alleles at one locus, with genotypic values determining either viability or fertility differences, and with either multinomial or exchangeable reproduction schemes. In the limit of weak selection in a large population such that N s tends to zero, the initial average allelic effects in allozygous offspring and autozygous offspring have the same weight on the fixation probability only in the domain of application of the Kingman coalescent. With frequency-dependent selection in a linear-game-theoretic context with two phenotypes determined by additive gene action, the first-order effect on the fixation probability is a combination of two effects of frequency-independent selection, one in a haploid population, the other in a diploid population. In the domain of application of the Kingman coalescent as the population size goes to infinity and N s to zero, the first effect is three times more important than the second effect. This explains the one-third law of evolutionary dynamics in this domain, and shows how this law can be extended beyond this domain. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The algorithm built with three or more markers allows the characterization of crossover interference in meiosis and high-order disequilibria among different genes, thus providing a powerful tool for illustrating a detailed picture of genetic diversity and organization in natural populations.

In our model, the photosynthesis and respiration terms are explicitly linked to physiological attributes of the plants and are forced with the primary climatic drivers: atmospheric CO2, air temperature, and precipitation. Under future climate scenarios, our simulations show that the system's fate depends on whether the enhancements to photosynthesis due to elevated atmospheric CO2 outweigh the increases in respiration due to higher air temperatures and the increases in water stress due to lower rainfall. A scalar measure is proposed to quantify this balance between the changes in the three climate drivers.

The utility of the simulations rely on the ability to replicate those aspects of the social structure that are relevant to epidemic transmission. One approach is to generate networks with desired social properties. Recent research by Keeling and his colleagues has generated simulated networks with a range of properties, and examined the impact of these properties on epidemic processes occurring over the network. However, published work has included only limited analysis of the algorithm itself and the way in which the network properties are related to the algorithm parameters. This paper identifies some relationships between the algorithm parameters and selected network properties (mean degree, degree variation, clustering coefficient and assortativity). Our approach enables users of the algorithm to efficiently generate a network with given properties, thereby allowing realistic social networks to be used as the basis of epidemic simulations. Alternatively, the algorithm could be used to generate social networks with a range of property values, enabling analysis of the impact of these properties on epidemic behaviour. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

We analyse the expected time to absorption and fixation in the 'quasi-neutral' case: both types have the same carrying capacity, achieved through a trade-off of birth and death rates. Such types would be competitively neutral in a classical, fixed-population Wright-Fisher model. Nonetheless, we find that absorption times are skewed compared to the Wright-Fisher model. The absorption time is longer than the Wright-Fisher prediction when the initial proportion of the type with higher birth rate is large, and shorter when it is small. By contrast, demographic stochasticity has no effect on the fixation or absorption times of truly neutral alleles in a large population.

	abstract = {Natural infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, as well as cross-immune reactions with the constituent of standard vaccines, attenuated M. bovis, and other species of mycobacteria confer partial immunity to subsequent M. tuberculosis infection. It has been shown in the past that the immune response to mycobacteria found naturally in the environment reduces the benefit of vaccination as assessed by means of vaccine efficacy. In this paper we show that efficacy is a poor measure of the potential success of new anti-tuberculous vaccines due to its inability to account for the relative weight of reinfection in disease dynamics. We advocate instead the use of vaccine effectiveness when evaluating the impact of new control methods against infections that confer partial immunity. Through the study of a simple model that incorporates cross-reactive responses to environmental mycobacteria (EM) and reinfection, we show how the particulars of the relation between EM abundance and vaccine effectiveness depend on the degree of protection conferred respectively by natural infection, vaccination and EM. The relative importance of reinfection as a transmission mechanism comes up as the most important source of variability in vaccine effectiveness. Our results suggest that control efforts should be placed in reducing the importance of reinfection through diminishing transmission rates. Vaccines that overcome preexisting immunity to other mycobacteria will still have varying degrees of success depending on the underlying rate of TB transmission. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {Genetic drift in finite populations ultimately leads to the loss of genetic variation. This paper examines the rate of neutral gene loss for a range of population structures defined by a graph. We show that, where individuals reside at fixed points on an undirected graph with equal degree nodes, the mean time to loss differs from the panmictic value by a positive additive term that depends on the number of individuals (not genes) in the population. The effect of these spatial structures is to slow the time to fixation by an amount that depends on the way individuals are distributed, rather than changing the apparent number of genes available to be sampled. This relationship breaks down, however, for a broad class of spatial structures such as random, small-world and scale-free networks. For the latter structures there is a counter-intuitive acceleration of fixation proportional to the level of ploidy. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Rao's quadratic entropy (QE) is a diversity index that includes the abundances of categories (e.g. alleles, species) and distances between them. Here we show that, once the distances between categories are fixed, QE can be maximized with a reduced number of categories and by several different distributions of relative abundances of the categories. It is shown that Rao's coefficient of distance (DISC), based on QE, can equal zero between two maximizing distributions, even if they have no categories in common. The consequences of these findings on the relevance of QE for understanding biological diversity are evaluated in three case studies. The behaviour of QE at its maximum is shown to be strongly dependent on the distance metric. We emphasize that the study of the maximization of a diversity index can bring clarity to what exactly is measured and enhance our understanding of biological diversity. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

We investigate the claim that the possible evolutionary behaviour can be predicted directly from the population dynamics, without the need for calculation, by applying three criteria - one based on the form of the density dependent rates and two on the role played by the evolving parameters. Taking a general continuous time model, with broad ecological range, we show that the claim is true. Initially, we assume that individuals enter in class 1 and move through population classes sequentially; later we relax these assumptions and find that the criteria still apply. However, when we consider models where the evolving parameters appear non-linearly in the dynamics, we find some aspects of the criteria fail; useful but weaker results on possible evolutionary behaviour now apply. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

We consider the performance of such 'pseudo-spatial' models as a function of R0, the locality in disease transmission, farm distribution and geographically-targeted control when an arbitrary number of spatial kernels are incorporated. One advantage of mapping complex spatial models onto simpler deterministic approximations lies in the ability to potentially obtain a better analytical understanding of disease dynamics and the effects of control.

Gamete size dimorphism may be an adaptation that increases gamete encounter rates when large zygotes are selected, and we show this in a mechanistically general individual selection model. We use the Vance survival function without specific allometric assumptions to model the zygote fitness dependence on its size, and hence obtain ecological and life-history correlates of isogamy and anisogamy, which we successfully compare with data from Volvocales. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Recent studies using SI models without acquired immunity have demonstrated that predation can suppress infectious disease levels. The authors recently showed that incorporating immunity (SIR models) can produce a "hump"-shaped relationship between disease prevalence and predation pressure; thus, low to moderate levels of predation can boost prevalence in hosts with acquired immunity. Here we examine the robustness of this pattern to realistic extensions of a basic SIR model, including density-dependent host regulation, predator saturation, interference, frequency-dependent transmission, predator numerical responses, and explicit resource dynamics. A non-monotonic relationship between disease prevalence and predation pressure holds across all these scenarios. With saturation, there can also be complex responses of mean host abundance to increasing predation, as well as bifurcations leading to unstable cycles (epidemics) and pathogen extinction at larger predator numbers. Firm predictions about the relationship between prevalence and predation thus require one to consider the complex interplay of acquired immunity, host regulation, and foraging behavior of the predator. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {The coancestry coefficient, also known as the population structure parameter, is of great interest in population genetics. It can be thought of as the intraclass correlation of pairs of alleles within populations and it can serve as a measure of genetic distance between populations. For a general class of evolutionary models it determines the distribution of allele frequencies among populations. Under more restrictive models it can be regarded as the probability of identity by descent of any pair of alleles at a locus within a random mating population. In this paper we review estimation procedures that use the method of moments or are maximum likelihood under the assumption of normally distributed allele frequencies. We then consider the problem of testing hypotheses about this parameter. In addition to parametric and non-parametric bootstrap tests we present an asymptotically-distributed chi-square test. This test reduces to the contingency-table test for equal sample sizes across populations. Our new test appears to be more powerful than previous tests, especially for loci with multiple alleles. We apply our methods to HapMap SNP data to confirm that the coancestry coefficient for humans is strictly positive. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

To make the results more applicable, we used in this study a general two-sample model, which assumes two longitudinal samples were taken from the same measurably evolving population. Inspired by the HIV study, we also studied a two-sample-two-stage model, which is a special case of two-sample model and assumes a treatment after the first sampling instantaneously changes the population size.

We present equilibrium conditions and derive approximations for the equilibrium population growth rate, food availability, and other food-dependent measures of population well-being. We examine how the approximations respond to environmental changes and to human choices, and find that the impact of environmental quality depends upon whether it manifests through agricultural yield or maximum (food-independent) survival rates. Human choices can complement or offset environmental effects: greater labor investments increase both population growth and well-being, and therefore can counteract lower agricultural yield, while fertility control decreases the growth rate but can increase or decrease well-being. Finally we establish equilibrium stability criteria, and argue that the potential for loss of local stability at low population growth rates could have important consequences for populations that suffer significant environmental or demographic shocks. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

The monoecious, diploid population is subdivided into finitely many panmictic colonies that exchange adult migrants independently of genotype. Underdominance and overdominance are excluded. If the degree of dominance is deme independent for every pair of alleles, then under the Levene model, the qualitative evolution of the gene frequencies (i.e., the existence and stability of the equilibria) is the same as without dominance. In particular: (i) the number of demes is a generic upper bound on the number of alleles present at equilibrium; (ii) there exists exactly one stable equilibrium, and it is globally attracting; and (iii) if there exists an internal equilibrium, it is globally asymptotically stable. Analytic examples demonstrate that if either the Levene model does not apply or the degree of dominance is deme dependent, then the above results can fail.

	abstract = {The Ideal Free Distribution (IFD), introduced by Fretwell and Lucas in [Fretwell, D.S., Lucas, H.L., 1970. On territorial behavior and other factors influencing habitat distribution in birds. Acta Biotheoretica 19, 16-32] to predict how a single species will distribute itself among several patches, is often cited as an example of an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS). By defining the strategies and payoffs for habitat selection, this article puts the IFD concept in a more general game-theoretic setting of the "habitat selection game". Within this game-theoretic framework, the article focuses on recent progress in the following directions: (1) studying evolutionarily stable dispersal rates and corresponding dispersal dynamics; (2) extending the concept when population numbers are not fixed but undergo population dynamics; (3) generalizing the IFD to multiple species. For a single species, the article briefly reviews existing results. It also develops a new perspective for Parker's matching principle, showing that this can be viewed as the IFD of the habitat selection game that models consumer behavior in several resource patches and analyzing complications involved when the model includes resource dynamics as well. For two species, the article first demonstrates that the connection between IFD and ESS is now more delicate by pointing out pitfalls that arise when applying several existing game-theoretic approaches to these habitat selection games. However, by providing a new detailed analysis of dispersal dynamics for predator-prey or competitive interactions in two habitats, it also pinpoints one approach that shows much promise in this general setting, the so-called "two-species ESS". The consequences of this concept are shown to be related to recent studies of population dynamics combined with individual dispersal and are explored for more species or more patches. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Modeling linkage disequilibrium and identifying recombination hotspots using single-nucleotide polymorphism data. Genetics 165 (4), 2213-2233]. The approach developed here may be used for efficient approximate likelihood-based analyses of unlinked data. However our copying model also considers the effects of recombination. Hence, a more important application is to loosely-linked haplotype data, for which efficient statistical models explicitly featuring non-equilibrium population structure have so far been unavailable. Thus, in addition to the information in allele frequency differences about the timing of the population split, the method can also extract information from the lengths of haplotypes shared between the populations. There are a number of challenges posed by extracting such information, which makes parameter estimation difficult. We discuss how the approach could be extended to identify haplotypes introduced by migrants. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Here I show that this method fails when the interval between observations is not matched by the timing of density impacts on growth. Time series overestimate instantaneous density impacts at low density and underestimate them at high density. More generally, logistic growth produces a deterministically decelerating decline in per capita growth with density if the interval between measures of population size exceeds any lag in density response. Deceleration arises independently out of stochastic density fluctuations, and under-compensating regulation. These multiple influences lead to the conclusion that sequential density estimates provide insufficient information on their own to reveal the identity of non-logistic growth processes. They can yield estimates of density compensation, however, which may suggest time lags in density dependence. Analysis of an empirical time series illustrates the issues. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {Many studies of evolutionarily stable strategies (ESS) for technical reasons make the simplification that reproduction is clonal. A post-hoc justification is that in the simplest eco-evolutionary models more realistic genetic assumptions, such as haploid sexual or diploid sexual cases, yield results compatible with the clonal ones. For metapopulations the technical reasons were even more poignant thanks to the lack of accessible fitness proxies for the diploid case. However, metapopulations are also precisely the sort of ecological backdrop for which one expect discrepancies between the evolutionary outcomes derived from clonal reproduction and diploid genetics, because substantially many mutant homozygotes appear locally even though the mutant is rare globally. In this paper we devise a fitness proxy applicable to the haploid sexual and diploid sexual case, in the style of Metz and Gyllenberg [Metz, J.A.J., Gyllenberg, M., 2001. How should we define fitness in structured metapopulation models? Including an application to the calculation of ES dispersal strategies. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B 268, 499-508], that can cope with local population fluctuations due to environmental and demographic stochasticity. With the use of this fitness proxy we find that in dispersal evolution the studied clonal model is equivalent with the haploid sexual model, and that there are indeed many differences between clonal and diploid ESS dispersal rates. In a homogenous landscape the discrepancy is but minor (less than 2%), but the situation is different in a heterogeneous landscape: Not only is the quantitative discrepancy between the two types of ESSs appreciable (around 10%-20%), but more importantly, at the same parameter values, evolutionarily stability properties may differ. It is possible, that the singular strategy is evolutionarily stable in the clonal case but not in the diploid case, and vice versa. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The agents in this game become able, after some time, to predict the a priori best option as a result of an evolution-driven learning process. We show that a self-segregated social structure can emerge from this process, i.e., extreme learning strategies are always favoured while intermediate learning strategies tend to die out. This result may contribute to understanding some levels of organization and cooperative behaviour in ecological and social systems. We use the ideas and results reported here to discuss an issue of current interest in ecology: the mistimings in egg laying observed for some species of bird as a consequence of their slower rate of adaptation to climate change in comparison with that shown by their prey.

	abstract = {Models of infectious diseases are characterized by a phase transition between extinction and persistence. A challenge in contemporary epidemiology is to understand how the geometry of a host's interaction network influences disease dynamics close to the critical point of such a transition. Here we address this challenge with the help of moment closures. Traditional moment closures, however, do not provide satisfactory predictions close to such critical points. We therefore introduce a new method for incorporating longer-range correlations into existing closures. Our method is technically simple, remains computationally tractable and significantly improves the approximation's performance. Our extended closures thus provide an innovative tool for quantifying the influence of interaction networks on spatially or socially structured disease dynamics. In particular, we examine the effects of a network's clustering coefficient, as well as of new geometrical measures, such as a network's square clustering coefficients. We compare the relative performance of different closures from the literature, with or without our long-range extension. In this way, we demonstrate that the normalized version of the Bethe approximation-extended to incorporate long-range correlations according to our method-is an especially good candidate for studying influences of network structure. Our numerical results highlight the importance of the clustering coefficient and the square clustering coefficient for predicting disease dynamics at low and intermediate values of transmission rate, and demonstrate the significance of path redundancy for disease persistence. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Whittaker first proposed to measure the variation in species composition among plots or β-diversity as the ratio between regional diversity (γ-diversity) and average local diversity (α-diversity). More recently, an alternative way of partitioning diversity for which β-diversity is obtained as the difference between γ-diversity and average α-diversity has become very popular for linking the structure of species assemblages to ecosystem functioning in a spatially explicit manner. Unfortunately, additive β-diversity computed from species presences and absences suffers from the major drawback of being dependent on regional species richness. For instance, if the separation between β-diversity and γ-diversity is incomplete, so that variation in species composition is affected by species richness, then differences in β-diversity values among different sets of plots could reflect differences in the species count rather than any fundamental difference in species composition among the plots. Based on the above observation, in this paper I will first propose a basic requirement for β-diversity measures that adequately captures our intuitive notion of independence of species richness. Next, I will show that additive β-diversity computed from species presence and absence scores can be interpreted within the framework of fuzzy set theory. Finally, based on this unusual "fuzzy" interpretation of additive β-diversity, I will introduce two families of parametric β-diversity measures whose members have varying sensitivities to the presence of rare and frequent species. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

However, when insect populations are clustered as a result of limited dispersal, genetic control efficiency can be enhanced. In developing the model, we relax a key assumption of previous theoretical studies of genetic control: that released genetic control insects remain homogenously distributed irrespective of the spatial structure of the wild type populations. Here, this behavior (termed the 'coverage proportion') is parameterized and its properties are explored.

	abstract = {A coalescent dual process for a multi-type Moran model with genic selection is derived using a generator approach. This leads to an expansion of the transition functions in the Moran model and the Wright-Fisher diffusion process limit in terms of the transition functions for the coalescent dual. A graphical representation of the Moran model (in the spirit of Harris) identifies the dual as a strong dual process following typed lines backwards in time. An application is made to the harmonic measure problem of finding the joint probability distribution of the time to the first loss of an allele from the population and the distribution of the surviving alleles at the time of loss. Our dual process mirrors the Ancestral Selection Graph of [Krone, S. M., Neuhauser, C., 1997. Ancestral processes with selection. Theoret. Popul. Biol. 51, 210-237; Neuhauser, C., Krone, S. M., 1997. The genealogy of samples in models with selection. Genetics 145, 519-534], which allows one to reconstruct the genealogy of a random sample from a population subject to genic selection. In our setting, we follow [Stephens, M., Donnelly, P., 2002. Ancestral inference in population genetics models with selection. Aust. N. Z. J. Stat. 45, 395-430] in assuming that the types of individuals in the sample are known. There are also close links to [Fearnhead, P., 2002. The common ancestor at a nonneutral locus. J. Appl.

	abstract = {Historical records show that culture can increase exponentially in time, e.g., in number of poems, musical works, scientific discoveries. We model how human capacities for creativity and cultural transmission may make such an increase possible, suggesting that: (1) creativity played a major role at the origin of human culture and for its accumulation throughout history, because cultural transmission cannot, on its own, generate exponentially increasing amounts of culture; (2) exponential increase in amount of culture can only occur if creativity is positively influenced by culture. The evolution of cultural transmission is often considered the main genetic bottleneck for the origin of culture, because natural selection cannot favor cultural transmission without any culture to transmit. Our models suggest that an increase in individual creativity may have been the first step toward human culture, because in a population of creative individuals there may be enough non-genetic information to favor the evolution of cultural transmission. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Under indirect reciprocity, an individual who helps others gets returns indirectly from others who know her good reputation. Recently, many studies have discussed the effect of reputation criteria based only on the former actions of the others (first-order information) and of those based also on the former reputation of opponents of the others (second-order information) on the evolution of indirect reciprocity. In this study, we investigate the evolutionary stability of the indirectly reciprocal strategy (discriminating strategy: DIS), which cooperates only with opponents who have good reputations, in n (> 2)-person games where more than two individuals take part in a single group (interaction). We show that in n-person games, DIS is an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) even under the image-scoring reputation criterion, which is based only on first-order information and where cooperations (defections) are judged to be good (bad). This result is in contrast to that of 2-person games where DIS is not an ESS under reputation criteria based only on first-order information. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Here, we examine the r2 measure of LD and its mathematical relationship to allele frequencies, quantifying the constraints on its maximum value. Assuming independent uniform distributions for the allele frequencies of two biallelic loci, we find that the mean maximum value of r2 is ∼0.43051, and that r2 can exceed a threshold of 4/5 in only ∼14.232% of the allele frequency space. If one locus is assumed to have known allele frequencies-the situation in an association study in which LD between a known marker locus and an unknown trait locus is of interest-we find that the mean maximum value of r2 is greatest when the known locus has a minor allele frequency of ∼0.30131. We find that in 1/4 of the space of allowed values of minor allele frequencies and haplotype frequencies at a pair of loci, the unconstrained maximum r2 allowing for the possibility of recombination between the loci exceeds the constrained maximum assuming that no recombination has occurred. Finally, we use rmax2 to examine the connection between r2 and the D′ measure of linkage disequilibrium, finding that r2 / rmax2 = D′ 2 for ∼72.683% of the space of allowed values of (pa, pb, pa b). Our results concerning the properties of r2 have the potential to inform the interpretation of unusual LD behavior and to assist in the design of LD-based association-mapping studies. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {Genetic influx into a population often does not correspond to the real migration rate (m) of individuals, due to class structure within the population. The effective migration rate (me) is a concept to measure gene flow in such a situation. The ratio of the effective migration rate to the real migration rate (frac(me, m)) is called the gene flow factor, and represents the degree of gene flow modification. Prior authors proposed different definitions of the effective migration rate. These may be categorized into two groups: the neutral effective migration rate and the selective effective migration rate. In this article, we construct a general model of a class-structured population with a mainland-island structure. Using the model, we prove that the gene flow factor of the neutral effective migration rate converges to the mean reproductive value of immigrants if the limit is taken with the real migration rate converging to zero. This limit theorem provides a novel interpretation of gene flow and can be used to derive approximation formulae of the neutral effective migration rate. We illustrate this method analyzing two examples, sex ratio distortion due to extrinsic factors and hybrid zones with underdominance. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

In practice, population models have substantial parameter uncertainty, and it might be difficult to quantify the effect of this uncertainty on the leading eigenvalue. For a large class of matrices and integral operators A, we give sufficient conditions for an eigenvalue to be the leading eigenvalue. By preselecting the leading eigenvalue to be equal to 1, this allows us to easily identify, which combination of parameters, within the confines of their uncertainty, lead to asymptotic growth, and which lead to asymptotic decay. We then apply these results to the analysis of uncertainty in both a matrix model and an integral model for a population of thistles.

	abstract = {The rate at which mutations occur in nature is itself under natural selection. While a general reduction of mutation rates is advantageous for species inhabiting constant environments, higher mutation rates can be advantageous for those inhabiting fluctuating environments that impose on-going directional selection. Analogously, species involved in antagonistic co-evolutionary arms races, such as hosts and parasites, can also benefit from higher mutation rates. We use modifier theory, combined with simulations, to investigate the evolution of mutation rate in such a host-parasite system. We derive an expression for the evolutionary stable mutation rate between two alleles, each of whose fitness depends on the current genetic composition of the other species. Recombination has been shown to weaken the strength of selection acting on mutation modifiers, and accordingly, we find that the evolutionarily attracting mutation rate is lower when recombination between the selected and the modifier locus is high. Cyclical dynamics are potentially commonplace for loci governing antagonistic species interactions. We characterize the parameter space where such cyclical dynamics occur and show that the evolution of large mutation rates tends to inhibit cycling and thus eliminates further selection on modifiers of the mutation rate. We then find using computer simulations that stochastic fluctuations in finite populations can increase the size of the region where cycles occur, creating selection for higher mutation rates. We finally use simulations to investigate the model behaviour when there are more than two alleles, finding that the region where cycling occurs becomes smaller and the evolutionarily attracting mutation rate lower when there are more alleles. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Solutions for all three categories can coexist, with switch-like transitions among their attractors showing that varying dosages and frequencies of insecticide applications and the numbers of parasitoids released are crucial. Periodic solutions also exist for models with unfixed moments for which the maximum amplitude of the host is less than the economic threshold. The dosages and frequencies of IPM interventions for these solutions are much reduced in comparison with the pest-eradication periodic solution.

We show analytically why the optimal life history of a species with determinate growth is likely to have this shape. An organism allocates energy among somatic growth, fertility and maintenance/survival at each age. Adults may transfer energy to juveniles, who can then use more energy than they produce. Optimal juvenile mortality declines from birth to maturity, either to protect the increasingly valuable cumulative investments by adults in juveniles or to exploit the compounding effects of early investment in somatic growth, since early growth raises subsequent energy production, which in turn supports further growth. Optimal adult mortality rises after maturity as expected future reproduction declines as in Hamilton, but intergenerational transfers lead to postreproductive survival as in Lee. Here the Hamilton and transfer effects are divided by probabilities of survival in contrast to the fitness impact measures, which are relevant for mutation-selection balance. If energetic efficiency rises strongly with adult experience, then adult mortality could initially be flat or declining. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {It is well known that two predators with different functional responses can coexist on one prey when the system exhibits nonequilibrium dynamics. In this paper, we investigate under which conditions such coexistence is evolutionarily stable, and whether the two predators may evolve from a single ancestor via evolutionary branching. We assume that predator strategies differ in handling time, and hence in the shape of their Holling type II functional response. Longer handling times are costly in terms of lost foraging time, but allow the predator to extract more nutrients from the prey and therefore to produce more offspring per consumed prey. In the analysis, we apply a new method to accommodate arbitrary trade-off functions between handling time and offspring production. Contrary to previous results obtained assuming a particular trade-off [Kisdi, E. and Liu, S., 2006. J. Evol. Biol. 19, 49-58], we find that evolutionary branching of handling time is possible, although it does not appear to be very likely and can be excluded for a class of trade-offs. Evolutionarily stable coexistence of two predators occurs under less restrictive conditions, which are always satisfied when the trade-off function has two strongly concave parts connected by a convex piece. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The field of spatial modelling in ecology is more recent but a number of key advances have been made. In this paper, we use state-of-the-art approximation techniques, supported by simulations, in order to investigate the role of recovery and immunity in spatially structured populations. Our approach is to use correlation models, namely pair-wise models, to capture the spatial relationships of contacts and interactions between individuals. We use the pair-wise framework to address a number of key ecological questions; including, the persistence of endemic limit cycles and regions of parasite-driven extinction-features which differentiate spatial from non-spatial models-and the effects on invasion fitness. We demonstrate a loss of limit cycle behaviour, in addition to an increase in the critical transmissibility and extinction thresholds, when recovery is included. This approach allows for a better analytical understanding of the dynamics of host-parasite interactions and demonstrates the importance of recovery and immunity in local interactions. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {The effect of population structure on the probability of fixation of a newly introduced mutant under weak selection is studied using a coalescent approach. Wright's island model in a framework of a finite number of demes is assumed and two selection regimes are considered: a beneficial allele model and a linear game among offspring. A first-order approximation of the fixation probability for a single mutant with respect to the intensity of selection is deduced. The approximation requires the calculation of expected coalescence times, under neutrality, for lineages starting from two or three sampled individuals. The results are obtained in a general setting without assumptions on the number of demes, the deme size or the migration rate, which allows for simultaneous coalescence or migration events in the genealogy of the sampled individuals. Comparisons are made with limit cases as the deme size or the number of demes goes to infinity or the migration rate goes to zero for which a diffusion approximation approach is possible. Conditions for selection to favor a mutant strategy replacing a resident strategy in the context of a linear game in a finite island population are addressed. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

This paper develops a stochastic model to quantitatively describe and analyze mating systems on a continuous scale from strict monogamy to extreme polygyny. The variance in male mating success is shown to increase with increased differences among males, with decreased interdependence of mating events, with increased population size, and with an increased number of females per male. The latter condition decreases the opportunity for sexual selection. It is found that different combinations of mating system characteristics can lead to the same variance in male mating success, although the distribution differs. This emphasizes the importance of using a model of this type to study mating systems, rather than relying solely on the variance in reproductive success as a descriptor of different systems. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

If some environments are encountered only rarely, selection may not be strong enough for optimal switching probabilities to evolve. Here we calculate the evolution of switching probabilities in a finite population by analyzing fixation probabilities of alleles specifying switching rules. We calculate the conditions required for the evolution of phenotypic switching as a form of bet-hedging as a function of the population size N, the rate θ at which a rare environment is encountered, and the selective advantage s associated with switching in the rare environment. We consider a simplified model in which environmental switching and phenotypic switching are one-way processes, and mutation is symmetric and rare with respect to the timescale of fixation events. In this case, the approximate requirements for bet-hedging to be favored by a ratio of at least R are that sN>log(R) and θ N > sqrt(R) . © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The results presented here have more general implications as they indicate that the behavior of ecosystem models in the presence of advection can be very different from that occurring for homogeneous conditions.

One important issue has been the manner in which density-dependence acting on the host population through resource competition influences the likelihood of population cycles.

We find that host density-dependence can influence the persistence of the host-pathogen interaction, the likelihood of population cycles and the stability of the host-pathogen interaction. In particular, over-compensatory density-dependence is likely to lead to host-pathogen cycles while under-compensatory density-dependence can promote stability.

It is interesting to observe that by varying the quality and quantity of additional food we can not only control and limit the prey, but also limit and eradicate the predators. In the context of biological pest control, the results caution the manager on the choice of quality and quantity of the additional food used for this purpose. An arbitrary choice may have opposite effects leading to increase in pest concentration and eradication of the predator. This study offers insight into the possible management strategies that involve manipulation of quality and supply level of additional food to predators, for the benefit of biological control.

	abstract = {Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) has been shown to evolve from a relatively slowly replicating and mildly cytopathic virus early in the infection (SIVMneCL8) to a faster replicating and more cytopathic virus at later stages of the infection (SIVMne170). It has recently been demonstrated that the early and mildly cytopathic variant SIVMneCL8 out-competed the late and highly cytopathic strain SIVMne170 in cell culture experiments, because the fitness disadvantage derived from the higher cytopathicity was not matched by a sufficient increase in the viral replication rate. However, in another set of experiments where the life span of cells in culture was artificially limited, the late and more cytopathic virus won the competition, because under this condition cytopahticity was not an important determinant of viral fitness. It was hypothesized that the limited life span experiment reflected the immune-mediated high turnover environment in vivo more accurately, and that the presence of immune responses accounts for the selection of the cytopathic strain SIVmne170 during later stages of the infection. This paper investigates the effect of immune responses, in particular cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses, on the competition dynamics between these two SIV strains with the help of mathematical models. Model analysis and parameter estimates derived from previously published data on SIV growth kinetics suggest that the SIV-specific CTL response might not be the driving force that leads to the selection of the cytopathic strain SIVMne170 during later stages of the infection. This implies that more complex evolutionary mechanisms might have to be invoked in order to explain the emergence of these strains in vivo. One possibility is that the ability of multiple virus particles to infect the same cell (coinfection) might be a pre-requisite for the emergence of the cytopathic strain SIVMne170 as the disease progresses. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Here we consider the case of introgression of insecticide resistance in the whitefly, Bemisia tabaci. B. tabaci is a species complex consisting of a range of biotypes, known to have a high degree of inter-biotype reproductive isolation. In areas where insecticide resistant and susceptible biotypes of B. tabaci coexist, introgression of the resistance gene will have considerable consequences for whitefly control. Using a stochastic branching process model we calculate the relative importance of life-history traits in determining the probability of introgression given that a hybridization event has occurred. We show that a fitness cost expressed through the average number of eggs laid, has the largest effect on the introgression probability as compared to fitness costs expressed through other life-history parameters. These results change when we consider a reproductive isolation mechanism, for which we show that the fitness cost expressed through the male survival and mating probability have the largest effect on the probability of introgression. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {The Allee effect means reduction in individual fitness at low population densities. There are many discrete-time population models with an Allee effect in the literature, but most of them are phenomenological. Recently, Geritz and Kisdi [2004. On the mechanistic underpinning of discrete-time population models with complex dynamics. J. Theor. Biol. 228, 261-269] presented a mechanistic underpinning of various discrete-time population models without an Allee effect. Their work was based on a continuous-time resource-consumer model for the dynamics within a year, from which they derived a discrete-time model for the between-year dynamics. In this article, we obtain the Allee effect by adding different mate finding mechanisms to the within-year dynamics. Further, by adding cannibalism we obtain a higher variety of models. We thus present a generator of relatively realistic, discrete-time Allee effect models that also covers some currently used phenomenological models driven more by mathematical convenience. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

We study a more realistic, Rosenzweig-MacArthur, model that includes a carrying capacity for the prey, and saturating functional response for the predator. We show that dispersal delays can stabilize the predator-prey equilibrium point despite the presence of a Type II functional response that is known to be destabilizing.

Fundamental to the method is an approximation to the conditional probability of the allelic type of an additional gene, given those currently in the sample. As noted by Li and Stephens, the product of these conditional probabilities for a sequence of draws that gives the frequency of allelic types in a sample is an approximation to the likelihood, and can be used directly in inference. The aim of this note is to demonstrate the high level of accuracy of "product of approximate conditionals" (PAC) likelihood when used with microsatellite data. Results obtained on simulated microsatellite data show that this strategy leads to a negligible bias over a wide range of the scaled mutation parameter θ. Furthermore, the sampling variance of likelihood estimates as well as the computation time are lower than that obtained with importance sampling on the whole range of θ. It follows that this approach represents an efficient substitute to IS algorithms in computer intensive (e.g. MCMC) inference methods in population genetics. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {The significance of migration load in driving the evolution of recipient populations has long been documented in population genetics, but its effects have not been linked to the formation of biased sex ratios in natural populations. In this study, we develop a single-locus model to demonstrate how the migration load can shape the primary and secondary sex ratios in dioecious plants where sexual dimorphism is determined by the sex chromosomes (the XX-XY or similar systems). Our results show that migration load can generate an array of sex ratios (from the female- to male-biased primary/secondary sex ratios), depending on the selection systems at the gametophyte and sporophyte stages and on the sex ratio in the migrating seeds. Ovule abortion and the purging of maladaptive genes from the immigrating pollen at the gametophyte stage can alter the primary sex ratio and indirectly alter the secondary sex ratio. The presence of maladaptive sex-linked genes from the migrating pollen and seeds of males facilitates the outcome of the female-biased secondary sex ratios, while the presence of maladaptive sex-linked genes from the migrating seeds of females can lead to the male-biased secondary sex ratios. The detrimental effects of the Y-chromosome from the migrating pollen and seeds can enhance the formation of female-biased primary and secondary sex ratios. These theoretical predictions highlight an alternative approach to the existing sex-ratio theories for interpreting the formation of biased sex ratios in the populations that are subject to the impacts of maladaptive genes from immigrants. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {Large scale genomic surveys are partly motivated by the idea that the neutral genetic variation of a population may be used to reconstruct its migration history. However, our ability to trace back the colonization pathways of a species from their genetic footprints is limited by our understanding of the genetic consequences of a range expansion. Here, we study, by means of simulations and analytical methods, the neutral dynamics of gene frequencies in an asexual population undergoing a continual range expansion in one dimension. During such a colonization period, lineages can fix at the wave front by means of a "surfing" mechanism [Edmonds, C.A., Lillie, A.S., Cavalli-Sforza, L.L., 2004. Mutations arising in the wave front of an expanding population. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 101, 975-979]. We quantify this phenomenon in terms of (i) the spatial distribution of lineages that reach fixation and, closely related, (ii) the continual loss of genetic diversity (heterozygosity) at the wave front, characterizing the approach to fixation. Our stochastic simulations show that an effective population size can be assigned to the wave that controls the (observable) gradient in heterozygosity left behind the colonization process. This effective population size is markedly higher in the presence of cooperation between individuals ("pushed waves") than when individuals proliferate independently ("pulled waves"), and increases only sub-linearly with deme size. To explain these and other findings, we develop a versatile analytical approach, based on the physics of reaction-diffusion systems, that yields simple predictions for any deterministic population dynamics. Our analytical theory compares well with the simulation results for pushed waves, but is less accurate in the case of pulled waves when stochastic fluctuations in the tip of the wave are important. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

One necessary requisite to obtain this result is an asymmetry between partners in such a way that one of them (actor) proposes the cooperation and elects the partner, whereas the other (receiver) never rejects the offer because cooperation always reports benefits. The advantage of individuals possessing allele for preferential assortment is due to receiving more offers of mutually beneficial cooperation when there is linkage disequilibrium between the assortment locus and the cultural tags. An especially favorable scenario for the evolution of such preference is a subdivided metapopulation. In this case, the homogeneity within populations and the divergence between populations is favored, facilitating the existence of ethnic groups. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Superparasitism refers to a female parasitoid laying an egg in a host already parasitized by a conspecific. In solitary species, only one offspring per host is expected to complete development, hence the game. Hosts are often clumped in patches and several females exploiting such an aggregate of resource make its state change over time, hence the dynamical character of the game. Two coupled questions arise: (i) Is it worth accepting a parasitized host? (ii) When to leave the host patch? Through these decisions (i) the competition for healthy hosts and (ii) the trade-off between leaving in quest of a better patch and staying to make the patch less profitable for other parasitoids (this is a way to lower superparasitism likely to occur after having left the patch) are addressed. The aim of this work is to characterize a strategy that would be evolutionarily relevant in such a situation, as it directly concerns females' reproductive success. Investigating a (synchronous) nonzero-sum two-player differential game allows us to characterize candidate dynamic evolutionarily stable policies in terms of both oviposition and patch-leaving decisions. For that matter, the game is (in the most part of the parameter space) completely solved if the probability that superparasitism succeeds is assumed to be close to one-half, a fair value under direct competition. The strategic equilibrium consists, for each females, in (i) superparasitizing consistently upon arrival on the patch, and (ii) leaving when the loss of fitness due to superparasitism likely to occur after its departure is reduced to zero. The competing females are thus expected to leave the patch as they arrived: synchronously. Superparasitism does not necessarily lead to a war of attrition. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The model is defined as a two-dimensional birth-and-death process for allele number. Changes in allele number occur through density-independent death events and birth events whose per capita rate decreases linearly with the total population density. Uniquely for models of this type, the latter is determined by these same birth-and-death events. This provides a framework for investigating both the effects of fluctuation in total population number through demographic stochasticity, and deterministic density-dependent changes in mean density, on allele fixation. We analyze this model using a combination of asymptotic analytic approximations supported by numerics. We find that for advantageous mutants demographic stochasticity of the resident population does not affect the fixation probability, but that deterministic changes in total density do. In contrast, for deleterious mutants, the fixation probability increases with increasing resident population fluctuation size, but is relatively insensitive to initial density. These phenomena cannot be described by simply using a harmonic mean effective population size. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

We show that, in a suitable regime, the effects of randomness in damage segregation at fissioning are indistinguishable from those of randomness in the mechanism of damage accumulation during the organism's lifetime. Moreover, the optimal population growth is achieved for a particular finite, non-zero level of combined randomness from these two sources. In particular, when damage accumulates deterministically, optimal population growth is achieved by a moderately unequal division of damage between the daughters, while too little or too much division is sub-optimal.

	abstract = {The estimation of relatedness structure in natural populations using molecular marker data has become an important tool in population biology, resulting in a variety of estimation procedures for specific sampling scenarios. In this article a general approach is proposed, in which the detailed relationship structure, typically a pedigree graph or partition, is considered to be the object of inference. This makes available tools used in complex model selection theory which have demonstrated effectiveness. An important advantage of this approach is that it permits a fully Bayesian approach to the problem, providing a principled and accessible way to measure statistical error. The approach is demonstrated by applying the minimum description length principle. This technique is used in model selection to provide a rational way of comparing models of varying complexity. We show how the resulting score may be interpreted and applied as a Bayesian posterior density. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

We use these results to compute the probabilities of four different patterns of conditional identity and non-identity at the three loci under recombination and gene conversion.

	abstract = {Linking dispersal and range expansion of invasive species has long challenged theoretical and quantitative ecologists. Subtle differences in dispersal can yield large differences in geographic spread, with speeds ranging from constant to rapidly increasing. We developed a stage-structured integrodifference equation (IDE) model of the California sea otter range expansion that occurred between 1914 and 1986. The non-spatial model, a linear matrix population model, was coupled to a suite of candidate dispersal kernels to form stage-structured IDEs. Demographic and dispersal parameters were estimated independent of range expansion data. Using a single dispersal parameter, α, we examined how well these stage-structured IDEs related small scale demographic and dispersal processes with geographic population expansion. The parameter α was estimated by fitting the kernels to dispersal data and by fitting the IDE model to range expansion data. For all kernels, the α estimate from range expansion data fell within the 95% confidence intervals of the α estimate from dispersal data. The IDE models with exponentially bounded kernels predicted invasion velocities that were captured within the 95% confidence bounds on the observed northbound invasion velocity. However, the exponentially bounded kernels yielded range expansions that were in poor qualitative agreement with range expansion data. An IDE model with fat (exponentially unbounded) tails and accelerating spatial spread yielded the best qualitative match. This model explained 94% and 97% of the variation in northbound and southbound range expansions when fit to range expansion data. These otters may have been fat-tailed accelerating invaders or they may have followed a piece-wise linear spread first over kelp forests and then over sandy habitats. Further, habitat-specific dispersal data could resolve these explanations. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

We focus on the growth of fixation times with the number of subpopulations, and variation of fixation probabilities and times with initial distributions of mutants. A general formula for the fixation probability for arbitrary initial condition is derived by extending a duality relation between forwards- and backwards-time properties of the model from a panmictic to a subdivided population. From this we obtain new formulæ (formally exact in the limit of extremely weak migration) for the mean fixation time from an arbitrary initial condition for Wright's island model, presenting two cases as examples. For more general models of population subdivision, formulæ are introduced for an arbitrary number of mutants that are randomly located, and a single mutant whose position is known. These formulæ contain parameters that typically have to be obtained numerically, a procedure we follow for two contrasting clustered models. These data suggest that variation of fixation time with the initial condition is slight, but depends strongly on the nature of subdivision. In particular, we demonstrate conditions under which the fixation time remains finite even in the limit of an infinite number of demes. In many cases-except this last where fixation in a finite time is seen-the time to fixation is shown to be in precise agreement with predictions from formulæ for the asymptotic effective population size. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Sewall Wright observed that Fst = frac(1, 1 + 2 Nm) in a haploid diallelic infinite island model, where N is the effective population size of each deme and m is the migration rate. In demonstrating this result, Wright relied on the infinite size of the population. Natural populations are not infinite and therefore they change over time due to genetic drift. In a finite population, Fst becomes a random variable that evolves over time. In this work we ask, given an initial population state, what are the dynamics of the mean and variance of Fst under the finite island model? In application both of these quantities are critical in the evaluation of Fst data. We show that after a time of order N generations the mean of Fst is slightly biased below frac(1, 1 + 2 Nm). Further we show that the variance of Fst is of order frac(1, d) where d is the number of demes in the population. We introduce several new mathematical techniques to analyze coalescent genealogies in a dynamic setting. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The model is defined as a two-dimensional birth-and-death process with density-independent death rates, and birth rates that are a linearly decreasing function of total population density. We treat the 'quasi-neutral case' where both types have the same equilibrium population densities. This condition results in birth rates that are proportional to death rates. This can be viewed as a life history trade-off. The deterministic dynamics possesses a stable manifold of mixtures of the two types. We show that the fixation probability is asymptotically equal to the fixation probability at the point where the deterministic flow intersects this manifold. The deterministic dynamics predicts an increase in the proportion of the type with higher birth rate in growing populations (and a decrease in shrinking populations). Growing (shrinking) populations therefore intersect the manifold at a higher (lower) than initial proportion of this type. On the center manifold, the fixation probability is a quadratic function of initial proportion, with a disadvantage to the type with higher birth rate. This disadvantage arises from the larger fluctuations in population density for this type. These results are asymptotically exact and have relevance for allele fixation, models of species abundance, and epidemiological models. Crown Copyright © 2007.},

The SIRS models incorporate three routes of transmission (direct, vertical and indirect via free-living infectious units in the environment). With deterministic models we are able to understand the effects of different routes of transmission and other epidemiological factors on infection dynamics. In particular, vertical transmission has little influence on this dynamics, whereas the higher the indirect (direct) transmission rate the greater the tendency to persistent oscillation (stable endemic states). We show that the sustained cycles are also prone to demographic effect, i.e., persistent oscillation becomes impossible in the managed case (in the sense of balanced recruitment and death rates) by comparing with results in unmanaged populations (exponential population dynamics). Further, approximations of quasi-stationary distributions are derived for stochastic versions of the proposed models based on a diffusion approximation to the infection process. The effect of transmission parameters on the ratio of mean to standard deviation of the approximating distribution, used to judge the validity of the approximations and the expected time until fade out of infection, is further discussed. We conclude that strengthening any route of transmission may or may not reduce the expected time to fade out of infection, depending on the population dynamics. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

We consider a neutral coalescent model of two populations, where a derived population is founded as an offshoot of an ancestral population. For a given locus, using both recursive and nonrecursive approaches, we compute the probability distribution of the number of genetic founding lineages that have given rise to the derived population. This number of genetic founding lineages is defined as the number of ancestral individuals that contributed at the locus to the present-day derived population, and is formulated in terms of interspecific coalescence events. The effects of sample size and divergence time on the probability distribution of the number of founding lineages are studied in detail. For 99.99% of the loci in the derived population to each have one founding lineage, the two populations must be separated for ≥ 9.9 N generations. However, only ∼ 0.87 N generations must pass since divergence for 99.99% of the loci to have < 6 founding lineages. Our results are useful as a prior expectation on the number of founding lineages in scenarios that involve the evolution of one population from the splitting of an ancestral group, such as in the colonization of islands, the formation of polyploid species, and the domestication of crops and livestock from wild ancestors. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

It was pointed out recently that these two types of models are very similar in essence. In this paper, we present a method to construct multilocus models in the infinite island model of population structure (where deme size may be arbitrarily small). This method allows one to compute recursions on allele frequencies, and different types of genetic associations (including associations between different individuals from the same deme), and incorporates selection. Recursions can be simplified using quasi-equilibrium approximations; however, we show that quasi-equilibrium calculations for associations that are different from zero under neutrality must include a term that has not been previously considered. The method is illustrated using simple examples. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In Rosenzweig-MacArthur models of predator-prey dynamics, Allee effects in prey usually destabilize interior equilibria and can suppress or enhance limit cycles typical of the paradox of enrichment. We re-evaluate these conclusions through a complete classification of a wide range of Allee effects in prey and predator's functional response shapes. We show that abrupt and deterministic system collapses not preceded by fluctuating predator-prey dynamics occur for sufficiently steep type III functional responses and strong Allee effects (with unstable lower equilibrium in prey dynamics). This phenomenon arises as type III functional responses greatly reduce cyclic dynamics and strong Allee effects promote deterministic collapses. These collapses occur with decreasing predator mortality and/or increasing susceptibility of the prey to fall below the threshold Allee density (e.g. due to increased carrying capacity or the Allee threshold itself). On the other hand, weak Allee effects (without unstable equilibrium in prey dynamics) enlarge the range of carrying capacities for which the cycles occur if predators exhibit decelerating functional responses. We discuss the results in the light of conservation strategies, eradication of alien species, and successful introduction of biocontrol agents. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Different environments are known to have different colours and models have shown that colour can have important impacts upon population persistence and dynamics. This study advances current knowledge about the impact of environmental colour using a trophic model (consumer-resource) experiencing environmental noise (temperature) in a biologically realistic manner-derived mechanistically from metabolic scaling theory. The model demonstrates that the variability of consumers and resources can respond differently to changing environmental colour, depending upon (i) their relative ability to track and over or undercompensate for environmental changes and (ii) the relative sensitivity of their equilibria to environmental changes. These results form the basis with which to interpret differences and facilitate comparisons of the variability of ecological communities across gradients of environmental colour. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

In-host models can provide quantitative predictions of immune status and can thus offer valuable insights into the factors that influence transmission between individuals and the effectiveness of vaccination protocols with respect to individual immunity. Here we develop an in-host model of measles infection. The model explicitly considers the effects of immune system memory and CD8 T-cells, which are key to measles clearance. The model is used to determine the effects of waning immunity through vaccination and infection, the effects of booster exposures or vaccines on the level of immunity, and the immune system characteristics that result in measles transmission (R0 > 1) even if an individual has no apparent clinical symptoms. We find that the level of immune system CD8 T-cells at the time of exposure to measles determines whether an individual will experience a measles infection or simply a boost in immunity. We also find that the infected cell dynamics are a good indicator of measles transmission and the degree of symptoms that will be experienced. Our results indicate that the degree of immunity in adults is independent of the source of exposure in early childhood, be it vaccine or natural infection. Crown Copyright © 2007.},

Previous theoretical research has demonstrated that these two types of endosymbionts cannot stably coexist within a single unstructured host population if no doubly infected host individuals occur. Here, we analyse a model of two host subpopulations connected by migration. We demonstrate that coexistence of MK- and CI-inducing endosymbionts is possible if migration rates are sufficiently low. In particular, our results suggest that for coexistence to be possible, migration rates into the subpopulation infected predominantly with MK-inducing endosymbionts must be considerably low, while migration rates from the MK- to the CI-infected subpopulation can be very high. We also analyse how the presence of MK- and CI-inducing endosymbionts affects host gene flow between the two subpopulations. Employing the concept of the 'effective migration rate', we demonstrate that compared with an uninfected subdivided population, gene flow is increased towards the MK-infected island, but decreased towards the CI-infected island. We discuss our results with respect to the butterfly Hypolimnas bolina, in which infection polymorphism of CI- and MK-inducing Wolbachia has been reported across South-Pacific island populations. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {The term Darwinian fitness refers to the capacity of a variant type to invade and displace the resident population in competition for available resources. Classical models of this dynamical process claim that competitive outcome is a deterministic event which is regulated by the population growth rate, called the Malthusian parameter. Recent analytic studies of the dynamics of competition in terms of diffusion processes show that growth rate predicts invasion success only in populations of infinite size. In populations of finite size, competitive outcome is a stochastic process-contingent on resource constraints-which is determined by the rate at which a population returns to its steady state condition after a random perturbation in the individual birth and death rates. This return rate, a measure of robustness or population stability, is analytically characterized by the demographic parameter, evolutionary entropy, a measure of the uncertainty in the age of the mother of a randomly chosen newborn. This article appeals to computational and numerical methods to contrast the predictive power of the Malthusian and the entropic principles. The computational analysis rejects the Malthusian model and is consistent with of the entropic principle. These studies thus provide support for the general claim that entropy is the appropriate measure of Darwinian fitness and constitutes an evolutionary parameter with broad predictive and explanatory powers. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

In this paper, I calculate an approximation for a spatiotemporal population distribution as the result of a filter function convolved with the environmental variation. I find that there is no straightforward connection between spatial or temporal scales inherent to an organism's life history, such as mean lifetime or dispersal distance, and the population's sensitivity to variation at different scales. Rather, life history traits interact sensitively with the way environmental variation affects the organism. I comment on the implications for variation-mediated coexistence. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

In this paper, random graphs with a given degree distribution and a given expected number of triangles are constructed. By using these random graphs we analyze the spread of two types of infection on a network: infections with a fixed infectious period and infections for which an infective individual will infect all of its susceptible neighbors or none.

This article introduces a new nonparametric method, which provides a two-dimensional representation of a structural parameter called the genetical bandwidth, which describes genetic structure around arbitrary spatial locations in a study area. This parameter corresponds to the shortest distance to areas of significant allele variation, and its computation is based on the Womble's systemic function. A simulation study and application to data sets taken from the literature give evidence that the method is particularly demonstrative when the fine-scale structure is stronger than the large-scale structure, and that it is generally able to locate genetic boundaries or clines precisely. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

We compare predictions from each of the models for three variables that are of basic and applied interest: elk survival, aggregation, and use of habitat outside YNP. Our results suggest that despite low overall forage depletion in the winter, frequency-dependence is crucial to the predictions for elk movement and distribution. Furthermore, frequency-dependence interacts with mass-dependence in the predicted outcome of elk decision-making.

For large populations, the distribution of haplotype frequencies for two linked loci under the classical Wright-Fisher model is almost impossible to compute because of numerical reasons. However the Wright-Fisher process can in such cases be approximated by a diffusion process and the transition density can then be deduced from the Kolmogorov equations. As no exact solution has been found for these equations, we developed a numerical method based on finite differences to solve them. It applies to transient states and models including selection or mutations. We show by several tests that this method is accurate for computing the conditional joint density of haplotype frequencies given that no haplotype has been lost. We also prove that it is far less time consuming than other methods such as Monte Carlo simulations. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

I mainly focus on the relationship between the strength of conformity bias that evolves and environmental stability, which is one of the most important factors in the evolution of social learning. Using the evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) approach, I show that conformity always evolves when environmental stability and the cost of adopting a wrong behavior are small, though environmental stability and the cost of individual learning both negatively affect the strength of conformity. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

These authors primarily considered the case N = 10 and used simulations to reach their conclusions. Here we investigate this model in more detail, considering systems of different sizes with and without recombination, and with selection for convergence instead of to a specified limit. For the simpler evolutionary model lacking recombination, we analyze the system as a neutral network. This allows us to describe the equilibrium distribution networks within genotype space. Our results show that, given a sufficiently large population size, the qualitative observation that systems evolve to be robust, is itself robust, as it does not depend on the details of the model. In simple terms, robust systems have more viable offspring, so the evolution of robustness is merely selection for increased fecundity, an observation that is well known in the theory of neutral networks. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

When migration is either sufficiently weak or sufficiently strong relative to selection, the equilibria are described, convergence of the gene frequencies is demonstrated, and sufficient conditions for the increase of a suitably defined mean fitness are offered. If the selection pattern is the same in every colony and such that in a panmictic population there is a globally asymptotically stable, internal (i.e., completely polymorphic) equilibrium point, then under certain weak assumptions on migration, the gene frequencies in the subdivided population converge globally to that equilibrium point.

	abstract = {Seasonal oscillations in birth rates are ubiquitous in human populations. These oscillations might play an important role in infectious disease dynamics because they induce seasonal variation in the number of susceptible individuals that enter populations. We incorporate seasonality of birth rate into the standard, deterministic susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) and susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) epidemic models and identify parameter regions in which birth seasonality can be expected to have observable epidemiological effects. The SIR and SEIR models yield similar results if the infectious period in the SIR model is compared with the "infected period" (the sum of the latent and infectious periods) in the SEIR model. For extremely transmissible pathogens, large amplitude birth seasonality can induce resonant oscillations in disease incidence, bifurcations to stable multi-year epidemic cycles, and hysteresis. Typical childhood infectious diseases are not sufficiently transmissible for their asymptotic dynamics to be likely to exhibit such behaviour. However, we show that fold and period-doubling bifurcations generically occur within regions of parameter space where transients are phase-locked onto cycles resembling the limit cycles beyond the bifurcations, and that these phase-locking regions extend to arbitrarily small amplitude of seasonality of birth rates. Consequently, significant epidemiological effects of birth seasonality may occur in practice in the form of transient dynamics that are sustained by demographic stochasticity. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

This stage-structured model is derived as an approximation to a physiologically structured population model, which accounts for a complete size-distribution of the consumer population and which is based on assumptions about the energy budget and size-dependent life history of individual consumers. The approximation ensures that under equilibrium conditions predictions of both models are completely identical. In addition we find that under non-equilibrium conditions the stage-structured model gives rise to dynamics that closely approximate the dynamics exhibited by the size-structured model, as long as adult consumers are superior foragers than juveniles with a higher mass-specific ingestion rate. When the mass-specific intake rate of juvenile consumers is higher, the size-structured model exhibits single-generation cycles, in which a single cohort of consumers dominates population dynamics throughout its life time and the population composition varies over time between a dominance by juveniles and adults, respectively. The stage-structured model does not capture these dynamics because it incorporates a distributed time delay between the birth and maturation of an individual organism in contrast to the size-structured model, in which maturation is a discrete event in individual life history. We investigate model dynamics with both semi-chemostat and logistic resource growth. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The trait is under a mixture of frequency-dependent disruptive selection induced by intraspecific competition and frequency-independent stabilizing selection. Moreover, the trait is restricted to a finite range by constraints on the particular loci. Our investigations are based on explicit analytical results (provided by Bürger [2005. A multilocus analysis of intraspecific competition and stabilizing selection on a quantitative trait. J. Math. Biol. 50, 355-396]; Schneider [2006.

We show that the population always reaches a long-term equilibrium (LTE), i.e., an equilibrium that is resistant against perturbations of mutations of sufficiently small effect. In general, several LTEs can coexist. They can be calculated explicitly, and we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for their existence. In the case that more than one LTE exists, we exemplify numerically that the evolutionary outcome depends crucially on the initial genetic architecture, on the joint distribution of mutational effects across loci, and on the particular realization of the mutation process. Therefore, long-term evolution cannot be predicted from the ecology alone. We further show that a partial order exists for the LTEs. The set of LTEs has a 'largest' element, an LTE which is reached during long-term evolution if the effects of the occurring mutant alleles are sufficiently large. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {Many herbivore populations fluctuate temporally, but the causes of those fluctuations remain unclear. Plant inducible resistance can theoretically cause herbivore population fluctuations, because herbivory may induce plant changes that reduce the survival or reproduction of later-feeding herbivores. Herbivory can also simply reduce the quantity of food available for later feeders and this, too, can cause population fluctuations. Inducible resistance and food limitation often occur simultaneously, yet whether they jointly facilitate or suppress herbivore fluctuations remains largely unexplored. We present models that suggest that food limitation and inducible resistance may have synergistic effects on herbivore population dynamics. The population-level response of the food plant to herbivory and the details of how inducible resistance affects herbivore performance both influence the resulting herbivore dynamics. Our results identify some biological properties of plant-herbivore systems that might determine whether or not cycles occur, and suggest that future empirical and theoretical population dynamics studies should account for the effects of both food limitation and inducible resistance. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {The article shows that heritable quality differentials are consistent with the Zahavi Handicap Principle (the Truthful Signalling Hypothesis (TSH)). Earlier analyses have assumed non-heritable quality. The crucial innovation is the Malthusian equi-marginal principle: under selection pressures the relative numbers of higher- and lower-quality organisms will change until, in equilibrium, not the average but the marginal levels of quality will be equalized. Assuming kin selection, each male maximizes his own reproductive success and signals until the marginal value of more signalling is zero. We further require evolutionary stability; displacements to higher or lower population sizes must be restored to equilibrium. The article proposes an alternative to Fisher's [1958. The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection. Dover Publications, Inc., New York [Original publication 1929]] and Hamilton and Zuk's [1982. Heritable true fitness and bright birds: a role for parasites? Science 218, 384-387] suggestions. The model is solvable for ranges of parameters that constitute the stable region. We particularly consider the unit signalling costs of the high- and low-quality males, where it has been widely believed that for a TSH equilibrium the former must be lower than the latter. This article confirms our earlier result that this is not a necessary condition for a truthful signalling equilibrium, though the unit signalling costs of the high-quality males cannot be too much larger. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Traveling-wave theory is a semi-deterministic description of an evolving population, where the bulk of the population is modeled using deterministic equations, but the class of the highest-fitness genotypes, whose evolution over time determines loss or gain of fitness in the population, is given proper stochastic treatment. We derive improved methods to model the highest-fitness class (the stochastic edge) for both Muller's ratchet and adaptive evolution, and calculate analytic correction terms that compensate for inaccuracies which arise when treating discrete fitness classes as a continuum. We show that traveling-wave theory makes excellent predictions for the rate of mutation accumulation in the case of Muller's ratchet, and makes good predictions for the speed of adaptation in a very broad parameter range. We predict the adaptation rate to grow logarithmically in the population size until the population size is extremely large. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The former acts to increase interspecific competition while the latter favors facilitation. The net interspecific interaction is determined by the relative strength of the two feedbacks. The model is used to highlight new mechanisms of plant-interaction change by studying factors that tilt the balance between the two feedbacks. Factors addressed in this study include environmental stresses and patch dynamics of the woody species.

Preservation is the event that eventually every chromosome in the population is a descendant of the one which initially carried the duplicate. For a haploid population in which the absence of all copies of the gene is lethal, the probability of preservation has recently been estimated via a diffusion approximation. That approximation is shown to carry over to the case of diploids and arbitrary strong selection against the absence of the gene. The techniques used lead to some new results. In the large population limit, it is shown that the relative probability that descendants of a small number of individuals carrying multiple copies of the gene fix in the population is proportional to the number of copies carried. The probability of preservation is approximated when chromosomes carrying two copies of the gene are subject to additional, fully non-functionalizing mutations, thereby modelling either an additional cost of replicating a longer genome, or a partial duplication of the gene. In the latter case the preservation probability depends only on the mutation rate to null for the duplicated portion of the gene. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

We show that, at sufficiently small r, the clones dominating fitness classes, at the moment of their birth, are nearly the best fit in a population. New progeny clones are mostly generated by parental genomes whose fitness falls within a narrow interval in the middle of the high-fitness tail of fitness distribution. We also derive the fitness distribution for the distant ancestors of sites of a randomly sampled genome and show that its form is controlled by a single composite model parameter proportional to r. The ancestral fitness distribution differs dramatically from the fitness distribution of the entire ancient population: it is much broader and localized in the high-fitness tail of the ancient population. We generalize these results to the case of moderately small r to conclude that, regardless of fitness of an individual, all its distant ancestors are exceptionally well fit. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

For the sake of simplicity, population dynamics is often analyzed with 1-D models. An important question is: how adequate is such 1-D simplification of 2-D (or 3-D) dynamics for predicting species persistence. Here we show that dimensionality of the environment can play a critical role in the persistence of predator-prey interactions. We consider 1-D and 2-D dynamics of a predator-prey model with the prey growth damped by the Allee effect. We show that adding a second space coordinate into the 1-D model results in a pronounced increase of size of the domain in the parametric space where predator-prey coexistence becomes possible. This result is due to the possibility of formation of a number of 2-D patterns, which is impossible in the 1-D model. The 1-D and the 2-D models exhibit different qualitative responses to variations of system parameters. We show that in ecosystems having a narrow width (e.g. mountain valleys, vegetation patterns along canals in dry areas, etc.), extinction of species is more probable compared to ecosystems having a pronounced second dimension. In particular, the width of a long narrow natural reserve should be large enough to guarantee nonextinction of species via interaction of 2-D population patches. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The subgroups are further divided into two classes, consisting of individuals involved in high-risk sexual activities and individuals involved in low-risk sexual activities. The model considers the movement of individuals from high to low sexual activity groups as a result of public health educational campaigns. Thus, in this case public health educational campaigns are resulting in the split of the population into risk groups. The equilibrium and epidemic threshold, which is known as the basic reproductive number (R0), are obtained, and stability (local and global) of the disease-free equilibrium is investigated. The model is extended to incorporate sex workers, and their role in the spread of HIV/AIDS in settings with heterosexual transmission is explored. Comprehensive analytic and numerical techniques are employed in assessing the possible community benefits of public health educational campaigns in controlling HIV/AIDS. From the study, we conclude that the presence of sex workers enlarges the epidemic threshold R0, thus fuels the epidemic among the heterosexuals, and that public health educational campaigns among the high-risk heterosexual population reduces R0, thus can help slow or eradicate the epidemic. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The computational costs of this Markov chain Monte Carlo strategy scale well with the number of individuals in the sample, and the number of marker loci, but increase exponentially with the age (time since colonisation from the source population) of the local population. Consequently, this strategy is particularly suited to situations where the sample has been collected from a population which is the result of a recent colonisation process. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The convergent stable strategies (CSS) are identified by a numerical adaptive dynamics method and then checked for evolutionary stability. A strategy that is simultaneously a CSS and an ESS is called an attractive evolutionarily stable strategy (AESS). Our main findings are as follows. First, the AESS reliance on social learning is monotone increasing in the fixed interval between environmental changes and monotone decreasing in the quality of environmental information. Second, the AESS strength of conformist bias is monotone non-increasing in the fixed interval between environmental changes and monotone non-decreasing in the quality of environmental information. The first observation is in agreement with Henrich and Boyd (1998), but the second is in direct contradiction. In addition, we conducted Monte Carlo simulations as in Henrich and Boyd (1998), which supported our findings. We believe that the reason for the discrepancy with regard to the strength of conformist bias is that Henrich and Boyd (1998) did not allow a sufficient number of iterations for true convergence to occur. In conclusion, the conditions favoring a heavy reliance on social learning are not the same as those favoring a strong conformist bias. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Animal populations act as reservoirs for emerging diseases. In order for transmission to be self-sustaining, a pathogen must have a basic reproduction number R0 > 1. Following a founding transmission event from an animal reservoir to humans, a pathogen has not yet adapted to its new environment and is likely to have an R0 < 1. However, subsequent evolution may rescue the pathogen from extinction in its new host. Recent applications of branching process theory investigate how the emergence of a novel pathogen is influenced by the number and rates of intermediate evolutionary steps. In addition, repeated contacts between human and reservoir populations may promote pathogen emergence. This article extends a stepping-stone model of pathogen evolution to include reservoir interactions. We demonstrate that the probability of a founding event culminating in an emerged pathogen can be significantly influenced by ongoing reservoir interactions. While infrequent reservoir interactions do not change the probability of disease emergence, moderately frequent interactions can promote emergence by facilitating adaptation to humans. Frequent reservoir interactions promote emergence even with minimal adaptation to humans. Thus, these results warn against perpetuated interaction between humans and animal reservoirs, as occurs when there are ecological or environmental changes that bring humans into more frequent contact with animal reservoirs. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {Infectious pathogens compete and are subject to natural selection at multiple levels. For example, viral strains compete for access to host resources within an infected host and, at the same time, compete for access to susceptible hosts within the host population. Here we propose a novel approach to study the interplay between within- and between-host competition. This approach allows for a single host to be infected by and transmit two strains of the same pathogen. We do this by nesting a model for the host-pathogen dynamics within each infected host into an epidemiological model. The nesting of models allows the between-host infectivity and mortality rates suffered by infected hosts to be functions of the disease progression at the within-host level. We present a general method for computing the basic reproduction ratio of a pathogen in such a model. We then illustrate our method using a basic model for the within-host dynamics of viral infections, embedded within the simplest susceptible-infected (SI) epidemiological model. Within this nested framework, we show that the virion production rate at the level of the cell-virus interaction leads, via within-host competition, to the presence or absence of between-host level competitive exclusion. In particular, we find that in the absence of mutation the strain that maximizes between-host fitness can outcompete all other strains. In the presence of mutation we observe a complex invasion landscape showing the possibility of coexistence. Although we emphasize the application to human viral diseases, we expect this methodology to be applicable to be many host-parasite systems. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

To understand how these patterns could emerge in rivers, we analyze a reaction-advection-diffusion model for two competitors in heterogeneous environments. The model supports waves that invade upstream up to a well-defined "upstream invasion limit". We discuss how these waves are produced and present their key properties. We suggest that patterns of species replacement and coexistence along spatial axes reflect stalled waves, produced from diffusion, advection, and species interactions.

By changing the spatial configuration of the patches in the system-leading to different proportions of edge and interior patches-we demonstrate that the probability of metapopulation extinction is smaller when the metapopulation is more compact.

	abstract = {In theory and practice, many ecological communities possessing a stable coexistence steady state may, in actuality, be difficult to assemble species-by-species, due to temporarily low densities of one or more preexisting species after the introduction of a new community member. This article elucidates some of the conditions under which these transient near-extinctions are likely to occur. These conditions are given in terms of such geometric quantities as the position of the new coexistence state after an invasion, relative to the original coexistence state, and the severity of the post-invasion community's oscillations, as well as more directly biological quantities such as the demographic rates of the invader and the potential victim of a crash. Through graphical reasoning, numerical examples, and preliminary experimental results, the importance of these conditions is demonstrated. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Unobserved factors generate hidden variability in susceptibility to diseases and death in populations and in age trajectories of longitudinally measured indices. Effects of such heterogeneity can be manifested not only in observed hazard rates but also in average trajectories of measured indices. Although effects of hidden heterogeneity on observed mortality rates are widely discussed, their role in forming age patterns of other aging-related characteristics (average trajectories of physiological state, stress resistance, etc.) is less clear. We propose a model of hidden heterogeneity to analyze its effects in longitudinal data. The approach takes the presence of hidden heterogeneity into account and incorporates several major concepts currently developing in aging research (allostatic load, aging-associated decline in adaptive capacity and stress-resistance, age-dependent physiological norms).

A dendrogram of the125 regions was built and the clusters identified by the dendrogram are almost exactly coincident with the nations of the Subcontinent. Random inbreeding calculated from isonymy, FST, was highest in Spanish regions, and lowest in France. The geographical distribution of α in 2094 towns, high in the Center and East of the Subcontinent and lower in Spain, is compatible with the settlement of subsequent waves of migrants moving from the West and from the South toward the centre of the Continent.

The local dynamics in the metapopulation are based on the Beverton-Holt model with mechanistic underpinnings. The consumer faces a trade-off in the abilities to consume two resources that are spatially heterogeneously distributed to patches that are prone to local catastrophes. We explore the factors favoring the spread of generalist or specialist strategies. Increasing fecundity or decreasing catastrophe probability favors the spread of the generalist strategy and increasing environmental heterogeneity enlarges the parameter domain where the evolutionary branching is possible. When there are no catastrophes, increasing emigration diminishes the parameter domain where the evolutionary branching may occur. Otherwise, the effect of emigration on evolutionary dynamics is non-monotonous: both small and large values of emigration probability favor the spread of the specialist strategies whereas the parameter domain where evolutionary branching may occur is largest when the emigration probability has intermediate values. We compare how different forms of spatial heterogeneity and different models of local growth affect the evolutionary dynamics. We show that even small changes in the resource dynamics may have outstanding evolutionary effects to the consumers. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Several cancers are thought to be driven by cells with stem cell like properties. An important characteristic of stem cells, which also applies to primitive tumor cells, is the ability to undergo quiescence, where cells can temporarily stop the cell cycle. Cellular quiescence can affect the kinetics of tumor growth, and the susceptibility of the cells to therapy. To study how quiescence affects treatment, we formulate a stochastic birth-death process with quiescence, on a combinatorial cellular mutation network, and consider the pre-treatment (growth) and treatment (decay) regimes. We find that, in the absence of mutations, treatment (if sufficiently strong) will proceed as a biphasic decline with the first (faster) phase driven by the elimination of the cycling cells and the second (slower) phase limited by the process of cell awakening. Other regimes are possible for weaker treatments. We also describe how the process of mutant generation is influenced by quiescence. Interestingly, for single-drug treatments, the probability to have resistance at start of treatment is independent of quiescence. For two or more drugs, the probability to have generated resistant mutants before treatment grows with quiescence. Finally, we study the influence of quiescence on the treatment phase. Starting from a given composition of mutants, the chances of treatment success are not influenced by the presence of quiescence. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Established schemes such as capture-recapture often are not feasible. In the proposed residual demography paradigm, individuals are randomly sampled from the wild population at unknown ages and the resulting captive cohort is reared out in the laboratory until death. Under some basic assumptions one obtains a demographic convolution equation that involves the unknown age distribution of the wild population, the observed survival function of the captive cohort, and the observed survival function of a reference cohort that is independently raised in the laboratory from birth. We adopt a statistical penalized least squares method for the deconvolution of this equation, aiming at extracting the age distribution of the wild population under suitable constraints. Under stationarity of the population, the age density is proportional to the survival function of the wild population and can thus be inferred. Several extensions are discussed.

The non-neutral model consists of two guilds of species such that (1) individuals between guilds do not interact, (2) dynamics within guilds follow Hubbell's model and (3) neutral parameters between guilds differ. This two-guild model generates SADs that appear neutral in some cases and clearly non-neutral in other cases. This result suggests that SADs may be more informative about niche structure than previously thought. The two-guild model could be tested in communities composed of fairly well-defined guilds or functional groups. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Early simulation studies have showed that the inclusion of epistatic components (especially the additive-by-additive effects) into marker-assisted selection (MAS) can improve selection efficiency for a short-term breeding program. In this study I extend Lande and Thompson's theory to incorporate both additive and non-additive effects into MAS with reference to the mass selection case. Four different indices are analytically examined in terms of the type of genetic components involved in the marker scores: phenotype-, general combining ability (GCA)-, and GCA and reciprocal effects-based marker scores. The phenotype-based marker index is applicable to any population of non-random mating, while the other three indices are applicable to the synthetic population derived from diallel crosses. All these indices may have higher selection efficiencies than the index with solely additive effects-associated markers as long as the detectable transient non-additive effects are present. The improvement in selection efficiency depends on the magnitude of non-additive variances and the proportion of them explained by markers. The index with the phenotype-based marker scores operates on the whole of the additive and non-additive effects, and has the largest selection efficiency. The indices with the GCA-based marker scores operate only on additive and additive-by-additive genetic variation and have relatively small selection efficiencies. Inclusion of the markers from organelle genomes can also increase selection efficiency, depending upon the proportion of the total genetic variation attributable to organelle genomes and the proportion of them explained by organelle genomic markers. Sharing of markers among different marker scores does not facilitate the improvement of selection efficiency. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {If the food distribution contains spatial pattern, the food density in a particular patch provides a forager with information about nearby patches. Foragers might use this information to exploit patchily distributed resources profitably. We model the decision on how far to move to the next patch in linear environments with different spatial patterns in the food distribution (clumped, random, and regular) for foragers that differ in their degree of information. An ignorant forager is uninformed and therefore always moves to the nearest patch (be it empty or filled). In contrast, a prescient forager is fully informed and only exploits filled patches, skipping all empty patches. A Bayesian assessor has prior knowledge about the content of patches (i.e. it knows the characteristics of the spatial pattern) and may skip neighbouring patches accordingly by moving to the patch where the highest gain rate is expected. In most clumped and regular distributions there is a benefit of assessment, i.e. Bayesian assessors achieve substantially higher long-term gain rates than ignorant foragers. However, this is not the case in distributions with less strong spatial pattern, despite the fact that there is a large potential benefit from a sophisticated movement rule (i.e. a large penalty of ignorance). Bayesian assessors do also not achieve substantially higher gain rates in environments that are relatively rich or poor in food. These results underline that an incompletely informed forager that is sensitive to spatial pattern should not always respond to existing pattern. Furthermore, we show that an assessing forager can enhance its long-term gain rate in highly clumped and some specific near-regular food distributions, by sampling the environment in slightly larger spatial units. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {Varroa destructor is a parasitic mite of the Eastern honeybee Apis cerana. Fifty years ago, two distinct evolutionary lineages (Korean and Japanese) invaded the Western honeybee Apis mellifera. This haplo-diploid parasite species reproduces mainly through brother-sister matings, a system which largely favors the fixation of new mutations. In a worldwide sample of 225 individuals from 21 locations collected on Western honeybees and analyzed at 19 microsatellite loci, a series of de novo mutations was observed. Using historical data concerning the invasion, this original biological system has been exploited to compare three mutation models with allele size constraints for microsatellite markers: stepwise (SMM) and generalized (GSM) mutation models, and a model with mutation rate increasing exponentially with microsatellite length (ESM). Posterior probabilities of the three models have been estimated for each locus individually using reversible jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo. The relative support of each model varies widely among loci, but the GSM is the only model that always receives at least 9% support, whatever the locus. The analysis also provides robust estimates of mutation parameters for each locus and of the divergence time of the two invasive lineages (67,000 generations with a 90% credibility interval of 35,000-174,000). With an average of 10 generations per year, this divergence time fits with the last post-glacial Korea-Japan land separation. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This article analyzes the classical 2-resource-1-consumer apparent competition community module with the Holling type II functional response. Two types of resource regulation (top-down vs. combined top-down and bottom-up) and two types of consumer behaviors (inflexible consumers with fixed preferences for resources vs. adaptive consumers) are considered. When resources grow exponentially and consumers are inflexible foragers, one resource is always outcompeted due to strong apparent competition. Density dependent resource growth relaxes apparent competition so that resources can coexist. As multiple attractors (either equilibria or limit cycles) coexist, population dynamics and community composition depend on initial population densities. Population dynamics change dramatically when consumers forage adaptively. In this case, the results both for top-down, and combined top-down and bottom-up regulation are similar and they show that species persistence occurs for a much larger set of parameter values when compared with inflexible consumers. Moreover, population dynamics will be chaotic when resource carrying capacities are high enough. This shows that adaptive consumer switching can destabilize population dynamics. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

The rate at which individuals meet and interact is independent of their strategies. Here we extend this framework by allowing the interaction rates to depend on the strategies. This extension leads to non-linear fitness functions. We show that a strict Nash equilibrium remains uninvadable for non-uniform interaction rates, but the conditions for evolutionary stability need to be modified. We analyze all games between two strategies. If the two strategies coexist or exclude each other, then the evolutionary dynamics do not change qualitatively, only the location of the equilibrium point changes. If, however, one strategy dominates the other in the classical setting, then the introduction of non-uniform interaction rates can lead to a pair of interior equilibria. For the Prisoner's Dilemma, non-uniform interaction rates allow the coexistence between cooperators and defectors. For the snowdrift game, non-uniform interaction rates change the equilibrium frequency of cooperators. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {We link two-allele population models by Haldane and Fisher with Kimura's diffusion approximations of the Wright-Fisher model, by considering continuous-state branching (CB) processes which are either independent (model I) or conditioned to have constant sum (model II). Recent works by the author allow us to further include logistic density-dependence (model III), which is ubiquitous in ecology. In all models, each allele (mutant or resident) is then characterized by a triple demographic trait: intrinsic growth rate r, reproduction variance σ and competition sensitivity c. Generally, the fixation probability u of the mutant depends on its initial proportion p, the total initial population size z, and the six demographic traits. Under weak selection, we can linearize u in all models thanks to the same master formula{A formula is presented}where sr = r′ - r, sσ = σ - σ′ and sc = c - c′ are selection coefficients, and gr, gσ, gc are invasibility coefficients ( ′ refers to the mutant traits), which are positive and do not depend on p. In particular, increased reproduction variance is always deleterious. We prove that in all three models{A formula is presented}and gr = z / σ for small initial population sizes z. In model II, gr = z / σ for all z, and we display invasion isoclines of the 'mean vs variance' type. A slight departure from the isocline is shown to be more beneficial to alleles with low σ than with high r. In model III, gc increases with z like ln ( z ) / c, and gr ( z ) converges to a finite limit L > K / σ, where K = r / c is the carrying capacity. For r > 0 the growth invasibility is above z / σ when z < K, and below z / σ when z > K, showing that classical models I and II underestimate the fixation probabilities in growing populations, and overestimate them in declining populations. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Directional selection is assumed to be weaker than the selection acting directly on mutations via deleterious effects (purging selection), which renders all mutations to eventual elimination. The analysis embedding this restrictive assumption indicates that the evolutionary response of the character starting from an equilibrium state, in which mutation and purging selection balance but no directional selection is operating, decreases monotonically with time at an exponential rate. And the fading rate of responses is mostly determined by the direct deleterious effect. Contrary to the expectation by the standard selection limit theory based on fixation of extant genetic variation, the present model predicts that the selection limit depends on the intensity of directional selection, the limit being proportional to the ratio of the directional selection intensity to the direct deleterious effect. A slightly larger genetic variance is maintained at the selection limit than would be without directional selection. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

In this paper, we explore the potential dynamic consequences of interference by analyzing a two-disease model. By studying the stability domain of the model's equilibria, we find that the stable region of the two-disease endemic state becomes increasingly smaller as the strength of interference (largely determined by the disease-induced mortality) increases. When seasonal changes are included in the transmission rates, the bifurcation structure of the model's periodic cycles reveals that when the two diseases have similar mean transmission rates, multiple attractors in which the two diseases are strongly correlated can coexist, and that when the two diseases have very different mean transmission rates, the one with higher mean transmission rate may determine the dynamics of the system, with the other infection mimicking the behavior. We conclude that ecological interference can have important effects on the dynamical pattern of interacting diseases, the extent of which is determined by the epidemiological features of the diseases, their mean transmission rates in particular. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

This result underlies the way the evolutionary stability of traits is computed in games with continuous strategy sets. In this paper similar results are derived under isolation by distance. The first-order effect on expected change in allele frequency is given in terms of a measure of local genetic diversity, and of measures of genetic structure which are almost independent of allele frequency in the total population when the number of demes is large. Hence, when the number of demes increases the response to selection becomes of constant sign. This result holds because the relevant neutral measures of population structure converge to equilibrium at a rate faster than the rate of allele frequency changes in the total population. In the same conditions and in the absence of demographic fluctuations, the results also provide a simple way to compute the fixation probability of mutants affecting various ecological traits, such as sex ratio, dispersal, life-history, or cooperation, under isolation by distance. This result is illustrated and tested against simulations for mutants affecting the dispersal probability under a stepping-stone model. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {External forcing of a discrete time ecological system does not just add variation to existing dynamics but can change the dynamics. We study the mechanisms that can bring this about, focusing on the key concepts of excitation and suppression which emerge when analysing the power spectra of the system in linear approximation. Excitation, through resonance between the system dynamics and the external forcing, is the greater the closer the system is to the boundary of the stability region. This amplification means that the extinction of populations becomes possible sooner than expected and, conversely, invasion can be significantly delayed. Suppression and the consequent redistribution of power within the spectrum proves to be a function both of the connectivity of the network graph of the system and the way that external forcing is applied to the system. It is also established that colour in stochastic forcing can have a major impact, by enhancing resonance and by greater redistribution of power. This can mean a higher risk of extinction through larger fluctuations in population numbers and a higher degree of synchrony between populations. The implications of external forcing for stage-structured species, for populations in competition and for trophic web systems are studied using the tools and concepts developed in the paper. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Simulation and theoretical approximations for nonparametric linkage (NPL) analysis based on affected sib pairs reveal that NPL scores are inflated and type 1 errors increased when the inbreeding coefficient or rate parameter is underestimated.

However, there remains the problem of how norm-adopters and punishers coevolve within a single group. We develop a recursive system to examine the coevolution of norm-adopters and punishers where the viability of punishers is enhanced by one of two "metanorms": (1) Norm-observers reward punishers for punishing norm-violators (Reward Model); (2) Punishers punish non-punishers (Punishment Model). Both models generate a bistable system and each is characterized in phenotype frequency space by a distinct region of attraction to the equilibrium consisting of only norm-adopting punishers. Using a Monte Carlo simulation, we find that cultural drift may allow norm-adopters and punishers to coevolve from invasion into this region of attraction, resulting in their fixation. This coevolution typically occurs across a wider range of conditions under the reward- than the punishment-based metanorm. We also show that, under appropriate conditions, a large negative statistical association between the two traits may evolve only under the Reward Model. Furthermore, for each metanorm, a population of norm-adopters who always observe the norm can be locally stable over a continuum of punishment frequencies. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

This constraint presumably impedes the action of sexual selection relative to polygynous systems. In this paper, we use formal selection theory to show how population size and the adult sex ratio constrain the force of sexual selection and phenotypic evolution under monogamy and polygyny. The force of sexual selection is ultimately constrained by the number of males in a population and the theoretical limit to the rate of male phenotypic evolution is realized if a single male mates with one or many females. These results imply that the force of sexual selection is not strictly constrained by monogamy. The constraint on female phenotypic evolution is typically higher than the constraint on males under polygyny and similar to selection on males in monogamous systems. The sexual asymmetry in the force of selection under polygyny - not necessarily weak sexual selection on males of monogamous systems - may explain the prominence of sexual dimorphism in polygynous systems. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

In the present work the fitness landscape is not assumed to be spherically symmetric, hence different points, i.e. phenotypes, on a surface of constant fitness generally have different curvatures. We investigate two different approximations of Fisher's geometrical model that have appeared in the literature. One approximation uses the average curvature of the fitness surface at the parental phenotype. The other approach is based on a normal approximation of a distribution associated with new mutations. Analytical results and simulations are used to compare the accuracy of the two approximations. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Victims can be too sparse to support exploiter reproduction (under-exploitation) or they can be too readily driven to extinction (over-exploitation). Exploiters of seasonal resources face the additional challenge of surviving periods when victims are rare or unavailable. We formulate a fully stochastic model of highly seasonal pathogen-host dynamics and explore the interactions between an entomopathogenic nematode and its lepidopteran host. Our model suggests that if nematode populations experience the high rates of mortality predicted by short-term laboratory experiments, the paired threats of under- and over-exploitation should preclude the long-term persistence of this exploiter-victim system. We measured nematode mortality rates in the field and found that long-term mortality is lower than that predicted by short-term experiments. Incorporation of this new data into our model produces long-term persistence of local nematode populations across a range of initial nematode densities. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {We present an individual-based, spatial implementation of an existing two-locus population genetic model of niche construction. Our analysis reveals that, across a broad range of conditions, niche-construction traits can drive themselves to fixation by simultaneously generating selection that favours 'recipient' trait alleles and linkage disequilibrium between niche-construction and recipient trait alleles. The effect of spatiality is key, since it is the local, resource-mediated interaction between recipient and niche-constructing loci which gives rise to gene linkage. Spatial clustering effects point to a possible mechanism by which an initially rare recipient trait whose selection depends on niche construction could establish in an otherwise hostile environment. The same mechanism could also lead to the spread of an established niche-constructing colony. Similar phenomena are observed in the spatial modelling of two species 'engineering webs'. Here, the activities of two niche-constructing species can combine to drive a particular recipient trait to fixation, or in certain circumstances, maintain the presence of polymorphisms through the preservation of otherwise deleterious alleles. This may have some relevance to ecosystem stability and the maintenance of genetic variation, where the frequencies of key resources are affected by the niche-constructing activities of more than one species. Our model suggests that the stability of multi-species webs in natural populations may increase as the complexity of species-environment interactions increases. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {The shapes of interspecific range-size distributions at scales finer than the geographic range are highly variable. However, no numerical model has been developed as a basis for understanding this variation. Using self-similarity conditions, we present an occupancy probability transition (OPT) model to investigate the effect of sampling scale (i.e. sample grain) and species saturation (strongly positively correlated with the fractal dimension) on the shape of occupancy frequency distributions (fine scale expression of range-size distributions). In accordance with empirical observations, the model showed that core-modes are likely to be rare in occupancy frequency distributions. The modal occupancy shifted from core to satellite with an increase in sample grain (from coarse scale to fine scale) at a linear rate after log-transformation of occupancy. Saturation coefficients above a particular threshold generated multimodality. Bimodal distributions arose from a combination of different occupancy probability distributions (OPDs), with species-specific saturation coefficients generating occupancy frequency distributions of the shape commonly observed empirically, i.e. bimodal with a dominant satellite mode. This is a consequence of the statistical properties of the OPD, and is also largely insensitive to species richness. The OPT model thus provides a null model for the shape of occupancy frequency distributions. Furthermore, it demonstrates that the sample grain of a study, sampling adequacy (based on a linear sampling assumption) and the distribution of species saturation coefficients in a community are together largely able to explain the patterns observed in empirical occupancy frequency distributions. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

We found that evolution converges towards a unique long-term equilibrium where only two extreme phenotypes are present with frequencies identical to those of the mixed strategy that would be the unique ESS of the game defined by the basic fitness function of the model. As long as this precise phenotypic composition is preserved, any genetic configuration of the polymorphism is equally acceptable (selectively neutral) at the equilibrium. Thus the number of alleles and their dominance pattern may vary considerably among different equilibrium populations. If genetic expression of the trait is variable but the amount of variability is genetically modifiable, disruptive selection, acting on such modifiers, produces a steady increase of expression variability before the equilibrium is attained. In this case a population at the long-term equilibrium might even be genetically monomorphic, with the phenotypic dimorphism resulting from purely random individual variation. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

These programs can be accessed at http://qa.genetics.uga.edu/ pages/Exact2x3.htm. This solution of the sample size problem for an exact test will permit experimentalists to plan efficient sampling designs, determine the extent of statistical support for their hypotheses, and gain insight into the repeatability of their results.

In particular, two neighbors are likely to help each other if the cost of doing so is less than the benefit multiplied by r, their coefficient of relatedness. Since the latter is less than unity, mutual altruism benefits both neighbors. However, is it theoretically possible that acting so as to maximize the inclusive, rather than personal, fitness may harm both parties. This may occur in strategic symmetric pairwise interactions (more specifically, n×n games), in which the outcome depends on both sides' actions. In this case, the equilibrium outcome may be less favorable to the interactants' personal fitness than if each of them acted so as to maximize the latter. This paper shows, however, that such negative effect of relatedness on fitness is incompatible with evolutionary stability. If the symmetric equilibrium strategies are evolutionarily stable, a higher coefficient of relatedness can only entail higher personal fitness for the two neighbors. This suggests that negative comparative statics as above are not likely to occur in nature. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

For fixed levels of cross-protection, the chance that the second mutant establishes increases with ρ the basic reproduction ratio and some temporary immunity may be necessary to explain the slenderness of flu's phylogenetic tree. In the presence of moderate levels of temporary immunity, an asymmetric situation can arise in the season after the two mutants were introduced and established: if the offspring of the new mutant arrives before the offspring of the resident type, then the mutant-line may produce a massive epidemic suppressing the original lineage. However, if the original lineage arrives first then both strains may establish and the phylogenetic tree may bifurcate. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In both within-host and epidemiological models of pathogen dynamics, the basic reproductive ratio, R0, is a powerful tool for gauging the risk associated with an emerging pathogen, or for estimating the magnitude of required control measures. Techniques for estimating R0, either from incidence data or in-host clinical measures, often rely on estimates of mean transition times, that is, the mean time before recovery, death or quarantine occurs. In many cases, however, either data or intuition may provide additional information about the dispersal of these transition times about the mean, even if the precise form of the underlying probability distribution remains unknown. For example, we may know that recovery typically occurs within a few days of the mean recovery time. In this paper we elucidate common situations in which R0 is sensitive to the dispersal of transition times about their respective means. We then provide simple correction factors that may be applied to improve estimates of R0 when not only the mean but also the standard deviation of transition times out of the infectious state can be estimated. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {Traditional explorations of infectious disease evolution have considered the competition between two cross-reactive strains within the standard framework of disease models. Such techniques predict that diseases should evolve to be highly transmissible, benign to the host and possess a long infectious period: in general, diseases do not conform to this ideal. Here we consider a more holistic approach, suggesting that evolution is a trade-off between adaptive pressures at different scales: within host, between hosts and at the population level. We present a model combining within-host pathogen dynamics and transmission between individuals governed by an explicit contact network, where transmission dynamics between hosts are a function of the interaction between the pathogen and the hosts' immune system, though ultimately constrained by the contacts each infected host possesses. Our results show how each of the scales places constraints on the evolutionary behavior, and that complex dynamics may emerge due to the feedbacks between epidemiological and evolutionary dynamics. In particular, multiple stable states can occur with switching between them stochastically driven. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

In this paper, a method of computing the population-wide E [r2] is introduced for a model with recurrent mutation, genetic drift and recombination. The approach is algebraic and is based on the diffusion process approximation. In the limit as the population-scaled recombination rate ρ approaches ∞, it is shown rigorously that the asymptotic behavior of E [r2] is given by 1 / ρ + O (ρ- 2), which, incidentally, is the same as that of σd2.

	abstract = {This is a mathematical study of the interactions between non-linear feedback (density dependence) and uncorrelated random noise in the dynamics of unstructured populations. The stochastic non-linear dynamics are generally complex, even when the deterministic skeleton possesses a stable equilibrium. There are three critical factors of the stochastic non-linear dynamics; whether the intrinsic population growth rate ( λ ) is smaller than, equal to, or greater than 1; the pattern of density dependence at very low and very high densities; and whether the noise distribution has exponential moments or not. If λ < 1, the population process is generally transient with escape towards extinction. When λ {greater than or slanted equal to} 1, our quantitative analysis of stochastic non-linear dynamics focuses on characterizing the time spent by the population at very low density (rarity), or at high abundance (commonness), or in extreme states (rarity or commonness). When λ > 1 and density dependence is strong at high density, the population process is recurrent: any range of density is reached (almost surely) in finite time. The law of time to escape from extremes has a heavy, polynomial tail that we compute precisely, which contrasts with the thin tail of the laws of rarity and commonness. Thus, even when λ is close to one, the population will persistently experience wide fluctuations between states of rarity and commonness. When λ = 1 and density dependence is weak at low density, rarity follows a universal power law with exponent - frac(3, 2). We provide some mathematical support for the numerical conjecture [Ferriere, R., Cazelles, B., 1999. Universal power laws govern intermittent rarity in communities of interacting species. Ecology 80, 1505-1521.] that the - frac(3, 2) power law generally approximates the law of rarity of 'weakly invading' species with λ values close to one.

Further suppose they can time this action to optimise their fitness based on the expected current payoff and the probability distribution of later payoffs. For an example we consider the timing of the annual nuptial flight in eusocial insects. Using two population genetics models, we ask whether stochasticity leads to evolutionary conflict between the queen and her offspring. We find that the winning phenotype is independent of who controls the timing. The best response to any non-equilibrium population strategy is the same in both control scenarios, a result that carries over to the diploid case. Although inter-generational conflict is therefore ruled out, the models support a previous observation that at equilibrium some of the offspring have a lower expected payoff than others. By measuring fitness in terms of relative reproductive success, we show that all individuals are in fact equally well off making group-selectionist arguments unnecessary. As such, the models should improve our understanding of the difficult conceptual problem of the unit of natural selection in stochastic environments. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {We will elaborate the evolutionary course of an ecosystem consisting of a population in a chemostat environment with periodically fluctuating nutrient supply. The organisms that make up the population consist of structural biomass and energy storage compartments. In a constant chemostat environment a species without energy storage always out-competes a species with energy reserves. This hinders evolution of species with storage from those without storage. Using the adaptive dynamics approach for non-equilibrium ecological systems we will show that in a fluctuating environment there are multiple stable evolutionary singular strategies (ss's): one for a species without, and one for a species with energy storage. The evolutionary end-point depends on the initial evolutionary state. We will formulate the invasion fitness in terms of Floquet multipliers for the oscillating non-autonomous system. Bifurcation theory is used to study points where due to evolutionary development by mutational steps, the long-term dynamics of the ecological system changes qualitatively. To that end, at the ecological time scale, the trait value at which invasion of a mutant into a resident population becomes possible can be calculated using numerical bifurcation analysis where the trait is used as the free parameter, because it is just a bifurcation point. In a constant environment there is a unique stable equilibrium for one species following the "competitive exclusion" principle. In contrast, due to the oscillatory dynamics on the ecological time scale two species may coexist. That is, non-equilibrium dynamics enhances biodiversity. However, we will show that this coexistence is not stable on the evolutionary time scale and always one single species survives. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The relationships between a predator population's mortality rate and its population size and stability are investigated for several simple predator-prey models with stage-structured prey populations. Several alternative models are considered; these differ in their assumptions about the nature of density dependence in the prey's population growth; the nature of stage-transitions; and the stage-selectivity of the predator. Instability occurs at high, rather than low predator mortality rates in most models with highly stage-selective predation; this is the opposite of the effect of mortality on stability in models with homogeneous prey populations. Stage-selective predation also increases the range of parameters that lead to a stable equilibrium. The results suggest that it may be common for a stable predator population to increase in abundance as its own mortality rate increases in stable systems, provided that the predator has a saturating functional response. Sufficiently strong density dependence in the prey generally reverses this outcome, and results in a decrease in predator population size with increasing predator mortality rate. Stability is decreased when the juvenile stage has a fixed duration, but population increases with increasing mortality are still observed in large areas of stable parameter space. This raises two coupled questions which are as yet unanswered; (1) do such increases in population size with higher mortality actually occur in nature; and (2) if not, what prevents them from occurring? Stage-structured prey and stage-related predation can also reverse the 'paradox of enrichment', leading to stability rather than instability when prey growth is increased. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

We model competition between two alleles where recurrent mutation introduces a genotype with a rate of local propagation exceeding the resident's rate. We capture ecologically important properties of the rare invader's stochastic dynamics by assuming discrete individuals and local neighborhood interactions. To understand how individual-level processes may govern population patterns, we invoke the physical theory for nucleation of spatial systems. Nucleation theory discriminates between single-cluster and multi-cluster dynamics. A sufficiently low mutation rate, or a sufficiently small environment, generates single-cluster dynamics, an inherently stochastic process; a favorable mutation advances only if the invader cluster reaches a critical radius. For this mode of invasion, we identify the probability distribution of waiting times until the favored allele advances to competitive dominance, and we ask how the critical cluster size varies as propagation or mortality rates vary. Increasing the mutation rate or system size generates multi-cluster invasion, where spatial averaging produces nearly deterministic global dynamics. For this process, an analytical approximation from nucleation theory, called Avrami's Law, describes the time-dependent behavior of the genotype densities with remarkable accuracy. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {A distinctive signature of living systems is Darwinian evolution, that is, a propensity to generate as well as self-select individual diversity. To capture this essential feature of life while describing the dynamics of populations, mathematical models must be rooted in the microscopic, stochastic description of discrete individuals characterized by one or several adaptive traits and interacting with each other. The simplest models assume asexual reproduction and haploid genetics: an offspring usually inherits the trait values of her progenitor, except when a mutation causes the offspring to take a mutation step to new trait values; selection follows from ecological interactions among individuals. Here we present a rigorous construction of the microscopic population process that captures the probabilistic dynamics over continuous time of birth, mutation, and death, as influenced by the trait values of each individual, and interactions between individuals. A by-product of this formal construction is a general algorithm for efficient numerical simulation of the individual-level model. Once the microscopic process is in place, we derive different macroscopic models of adaptive evolution. These models differ in the renormalization they assume, i.e. in the limits taken, in specific orders, on population size, mutation rate, mutation step, while rescaling time accordingly. The macroscopic models also differ in their mathematical nature: deterministic, in the form of ordinary, integro-, or partial differential equations, or probabilistic, like stochastic partial differential equations or superprocesses. These models include extensions of Kimura's equation (and of its approximation for small mutation effects) to frequency- and density-dependent selection. A novel class of macroscopic models obtains when assuming that individual birth and death occur on a short timescale compared with the timescale of typical population growth. On a timescale of very rare mutations, we establish rigorously the models of "trait substitution sequences" and their approximation known as the "canonical equation of adaptive dynamics". We extend these models to account for mutation bias and random drift between multiple evolutionary attractors. The renormalization approach used in this study also opens promising avenues to study and predict patterns of life-history allometries, thereby bridging individual physiology, genetic variation, and ecological interactions in a common evolutionary framework. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

In this article we use the multilinear epistatic model to study the effects of different forms of epistasis on the response to directional selection. We derive an analytical prediction for the change in the additive genetic variance, and use individual-based simulations to understand the dynamics of evolvability and the evolution of genetic architecture. This shows that the major determinant for the evolution of the additive variance, and thus the evolvability, is directional epistasis. Positive directional epistasis leads to an acceleration of evolvability, while negative directional epistasis leads to canalization. In contrast, pure non-directional epistasis has little effect on the response to selection. One consequence of this is that the classical epistatic variance components, which do not distinguish directional and non-directional effects, are useless as predictors of evolutionary dynamics. The build-up of linkage disequilibrium also has negligible effects. We argue that directional epistasis is likely to have major effects on evolutionary dynamics and should be the focus of empirical studies of epistasis. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

In particular, we consider the case of no dominance using classical identity by descent arguments, which generalizes their results from two alleles to multiple alleles. To clarify the connections between the alternative methods, we obtain the same results using an intermediate method, which explicitly identifies the statistical effects of sets of loci. We also discuss the effects of population bottlenecks on covariances among relatives. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The most striking examples of this are on gentle slopes, where striped patterns are typical, running parallel to the contours. Previously, Klausmeier [1999. Regular and irregular patterns in semiarid vegetation. Science 284, 1826-1828.] has proposed a model for vegetation stripes based on competition for water. Here, we present a detailed study of the patterned solutions in the full nonlinear model, using numerical bifurcation analysis of both the pattern odes and the model pdes. We show that patterns exist for a wide range of rainfall levels, and in particular for much lower rainfall than have been considered by previous authors. Moreover, we show that for many rainfall levels, patterns with a variety of different wavelengths are stable, with mode selection dependent on initial conditions. This raises the possibility of hysteresis, and in numerical solutions of the model we show that pattern selection depends on rainfall history in a relatively simple way. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {A pathogen's route to survival involves various mechanisms including its ability to invade (host's susceptibility) and its reproductive success within an invaded host ("infectiousness"). The immunological history of an individual often plays an important role in reducing host susceptibility or it helps the host mount a faster immunological response de facto reducing infectiousness. The cross-immunity generated by prior infections to influenza A strains from the same subtype provide a significant example. The results of this paper are based on the analytical study of a two-strain epidemic model that incorporates host isolation (during primary infection) and cross-immunity to study the role of invasion mediated cross-immunity in a population where a precursor related strain (within the same subtype, i.e. H3N2, H1N1) has already become established. An uncertainty and sensitivity analysis is carried out on the ability of the invading strain to survive for given cross-immunity levels. Our findings indicate that it is possible to support coexistence even in the case when invading strains are "unfit", that is, when the basic reproduction number of the invading strain is less than one. However, such scenarios are possible only in the presence of isolation. That is, appropriate increments in isolation rates and weak cross-immunity can facilitate the survival of less fit strains. The development of "flu" vaccines that minimally enhance herd cross-immunity levels may, by increasing genotype diversity, help facilitate the generation and survival of novel strains. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

We develop a relationship that predicts the change in relative body size variation within a cohort will be approximately equal to the relative change in mean per unit size growth rate, when only size-dependent factors affect growth. When modeling cohort growth, relative size variation decreased, remained unchanged, or increased, as a function of growth rate-size scaling relationships, in a predictable manner. We use the approximation to predict how environmental factors (e.g., resource level) affect body size variation, and verified these predictions numerically for a flexible growth model using a wide range of parameter values. We also explore and discuss the assumptions underlying the approximation. We find that factors that similarly affect mean growth rate may differently affect size variation, and competition may increase body size variation without changing size-independent relationships. We discuss implications of our results to the choice of growth equations used in models where body size variation is an important variable or output. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

In this study, I systematically explore the properties of migration load in dioecious plants where gender dimorphism is determined by sex chromosomes (the XX-XY or similar system). Two stages of gene flow (pollen and seed) and two stages of selection (gametophyte and sporophyte) are jointly examined in the one- and two-locus cases. The general results show that several factors, including the maladaptive allele frequencies in migrants, migration rate, selection, and linkage disequilibria, can individually or jointly alter the relative sexual mortalities at either the gametophyte or the sporophyte stage, or both. When there are the same values between sexes in the parameters relevant to the migrant gene frequencies and two-stage selection coefficients under the additive viability model (without Y-chromosome and linkage disequilibrium effects), the average mortality is higher in ovules than in pollen since the males do not inherit the maladaptive genes from migrating pollen. The average mortality per individual in the homogametic sex is almost twice as large as that in heterogametic sex at the sporophyte stage. Under the additive viability model, the relative sexual mortalities at the gametophyte stage are negatively related to the relative sexual mortalities at the sporophyte stage. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Kozłowsky and Ziółko [1988. Thor. Popul. Biol. 34, 118-129] and Ziółko and Kozłowski [1995. IEEE Trans. Automat. Contr. 40(10), 1779-1783] presented a model with gradual transition from vegetative to reproductive growth. The central point of their model is a mixed state-control constraint on the rate of reproductive growth, which leads to a mixed vegetative-reproductive growth period. Their model is modified here in order to take into account the difference of photosynthesis use efficiency when energy is accumulated in the vegetative and in the reproductive organs of a plant, respectively. The simple assumption on correlation between photosynthesis and temperature permits us to modify the model in a form that is useful for changing climate. Unfortunately, the mathematical solution of the optimal control problem in Kozłowsky and Ziółko (1988) and Ziółko and Kozłowski (1995) is incorrect. The strict mathematical solution is presented here, the numerical example from Kozłowski and Ziółko (1988) is solved, and the results are compared. The influence of the length of the season and the relative photosynthesis use efficiency, as well as of the potential sink demand of the reproductive organs, on the location and duration of the mixed vegetative-reproduction period of growth is investigated numerically. The results show that the mixed growth period is increased and shifted toward the end of the season when the lengths of the season is increased. Additional details of the sensitivity analysis are also presented. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The basic formulation is motivated by a desire to understand the effects of asymmetries in multidimensional Lotka-Volterra systems. We first study the effects of perfectly specialist predators and find a rich collection of possible behaviors of the system including (1) extinction of all predators and subsequent extinction of the subordinate competitor, (2) dominant competitors and their predators coexist but the subdominant competitor goes extinct, (3) all species except the predator of the subordinate competitor coexist in coordinated phase-reversed chaos, (4) exclusion of one or more species occurs through an expanding heteroclinic cycle, and (5) all species coexist in an uncoordinated chaos. We then study the effects of five qualitatively distinct forms of polyphagy. In one case, corresponding to the well-known vulnerability to predation versus competitive ability trade-off, it is possible to have the subordinate competitor be the only survivor in the system. The other three cases of polyphagy lead to distortions in the basic pattern seen in the previously analyzed specialist case. Studying this case of ecologically motivated asymmetries in the basic Lotka-Volterra formulation is a step in the direction of fully understanding interacting populations. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {The ubiquity of cooperation has motivated a major research program over the last 50 years to discover ever more minimal conditions for the evolution of altruism. One important line of work is based on favoritism toward those who appear to be close relatives. Another important line is based on continuing interactions, whether between individuals (e.g., reciprocity) or between lines of descent in a viscous population. Here, we use an agent-based model to demonstrate a new mechanism that combines both lines of work to show when and how favoritism toward apparently similar others can evolve in the first place. The mechanism is the joint operation of viscosity and of tags (heritable, observable, and initially arbitrary characteristics), which serve as weak and potentially deceptive indicators of relatedness. Although tags are insufficient to support cooperation alone, we show that this joint mechanism vastly increases the range of environments in which contingent altruism can evolve in viscous populations. Even though our model is quite simple, the subtle dynamics underlying our results are not tractable using formal analytic tools (such as analysis of evolutionarily stable strategies), but are amenable to agent-based simulation. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

The symmetric model introduced by Lewontin and Kojima is among the few multi-locus models with epistatic interactions between loci for which a polymorphism with linkage equilibrium can be stable and this happens when recombination is sufficiently large. We show that an analogous property holds true for a different model, in which symmetry need exist at only one locus. The properties of this new semi-symmetric model are compared with those of the classical symmetric model. For tight linkage, two classes of polymorphisms are possible, depending on the magnitude of additive epistasis. The recombination rate above which linkage equilibrium becomes stable is derived analytically. As in the symmetric model, intervals of recombination in which no polymorphism is stable are possible, and stable polymorphisms can coexist with stable fixations. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

It has been proven that under alternating selection (when period of selection consists of two generations) a dominant suppressor of recombination is displaced and the allele for non-zero recombination becomes fixed within the population. For populations with inversion heterozygosity within the selective system (i.e. with zero recombination in heterozygote for rec-modifier and non-zero for homozygotes) fixation of one of the alleles (depending on the initial point) at the rec-modifier locus is predicted. For other values of recombination parameters, the behavior of the system was studied numerically. A full bifurcation picture of parameters was obtained.

	abstract = {In order to analyze the microevolutionary processes in host-associated microorganisms, we simulated the dynamics of rhizobia populations composed of a parental strain and its mutants possessing the altered fitness within "plant-soil" system. The population dynamics was presented as a series of cycles (each one involves "soil→rhizosphere→nodules→soil" succession) described using recurrent equations. For representing the selection and mutation pressures, we used a universal approach based on calculating the shifts in the genetic ratios of competing bacterial genotypes within the particular habitats and across several habitats. Analysis of the model demonstrated that a balanced polymorphism may be established in rhizobia population: mutants with an improved fitness do not supplant completely the parental strain while mutants with a decreased fitness may be maintained stably. This polymorphism is caused by a rescue of low-fitted genotypes via negative frequency-dependent selection (FDS) that is implemented during inoculation of nodules and balances the Darwinian selection that occurs during multiplication or extinction of bacteria at different habitats. The most diverse populations are formed if the rhizobia are equally successful in soil and nodules, while a marked preference for any of these habitats results in the decrease of diversity. Our simulation suggests that FDS can maintain the mutualistic rhizobia-legume interactions under the stress conditions deleterious for surviving the bacterial strains capable for intensive N2 fixation. Genetic consequences of releasing the modified rhizobia strains may be addressed using the presented model. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The Kingman coalescent, which has become the foundation for a wide range of theoretical as well as empirical studies, was derived as an approximation of the Wright-Fisher (WF) model. The approximation heavily relies on the assumption that population size is large and sample size is much smaller than the population size. Whether the sample size is too large compared to the population size is rarely questioned in practice when applying statistical methods based on the Kingman coalescent. Since WF model is the most widely used population genetics model for reproduction, it is desirable to develop a coalescent framework for the WF model, which can be used whenever there are concerns about the accuracy of the Kingman coalescent as an approximation. This paper described the exact coalescent theory for the WF model and develops a simulation algorithm, which is then used, together with an analytical approach, to study the properties of the exact coalescent as well as its differences to the Kingman coalescent. We show that the Kingman coalescent differs from the exact coalescent by: (1) shorter waiting time between successive coalescent events; (2) different probability of observing a topological relationship among sequences in a sample; and (3) slightly smaller tree length in the genealogy of a large sample. On the other hand, there is little difference in the age of the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of the sample. The exact coalescent makes up the longer waiting time between successive coalescent events by having multiple coalescence at the same time. The most significant difference among various summary statistics of a coalescent examined is the sum of lengths of external branches, which can be more than 10% larger for exact coalescent than that for the Kingman coalescent. As a whole, the Kingman coalescent is a remarkably accurate approximation to the exact coalescent for sample and population sizes falling considerably outside the region that was originally anticipated. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {When pathogen strains differing in virulence compete for hosts, spatial structuring of disease transmission can govern both evolved levels of virulence and patterns in strain coexistence. We develop a spatially detailed model of superinfection, a form of contest competition between pathogen strains; the probability of superinfection depends explicitly on the difference in levels of virulence. We apply methods of adaptive dynamics to address the interplay of spatial dynamics and evolution. The mean-field approximation predicts evolution to criticality; any small increase in virulence capable of dynamical persistence is favored. Both pair approximation and simulation of the detailed model indicate that spatial structure constrains disease virulence. Increased spatial clustering reduces the maximal virulence capable of single-strain persistence and, more importantly, reduces the convergent-stable virulence level under strain competition. The spatially detailed model predicts that increasing the probability of superinfection, for given difference in virulence, increases the likelihood of between-strain coexistence. When strains differing in virulence can coexist ecologically, our results may suggest policies for managing diseases with localized transmission. Comparing equilibrium densities from the pair approximation, we find that introducing a more virulent strain into a host population infected by a less virulent strain can sometimes reduce total host mortality and increase global host density. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

The model is an extension of the diffusion approximation of the Wright-Fisher model. As a measure of linkage disequilibrium, the squared standard linkage deviation, which is defined by a ratio of the moments, was considered. A system of ordinary differential equations that these moments obey was obtained. This system can be solved numerically. By simulations, it was shown that the squared standard linkage deviation gives a good approximation of the expectation of the squared correlation coefficient of gamete frequencies. In addition, a perturbative solution was obtained when the growth rate is not large. By using the perturbation, an asymptotic formula for the squared standard linkage deviation after a large number of generations was obtained. According to the formula, the squared standard linkage deviation tends to be 1 / (4 Nc), where N is the current size of the population and c is the recombination fraction between two loci. It is dependent on neither the initial effective size, the growth rate, nor the mutation rate. In exponentially growing populations, linkage disequilibrium will be asymptotically the same as that in a constant size population, the effective size of which is the current effective size. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

In this view most diversity measures, such as Shannon's entropy, rely upon information theory as a basis for the quantification of diversity. Also, traditional diversity measures are computed using species relative abundances and cannot account for the ecological differences between species. Rao first proposed a diversity index, termed quadratic diversity (Q) that incorporates both species relative abundances and pairwise distances between species. Quadratic diversity is traditionally defined as the expected distance between two randomly selected individuals. In this paper, we show that quadratic diversity can be interpreted as the expected conflict among the species of a given assemblage. From this unusual interpretation, it naturally follows that Rao's Q can be related to the Shannon entropy through a generalized version of the Tsallis parametric entropy. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

We have found the equilibria and analyzed the behavior of the system around each one of them. A threshold result determining when the disease dies out has been identified. We also investigated the parametric space under which the system enters into Hopf and transcritical bifurcations, around the disease free equilibrium. The system is shown to experience neither saddle-node nor pitch-fork bifurcation. Global stability results are obtained by constructing suitable Lyapunov functions. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Numerical and heuristic evidence is presented pointing to the fact that the error incurred when using the formulae of Bailey or Chapman-Seber depends asymptotically only on the number of recaptured animals, and will not diminish if the number of captured animals becomes large while the number of recaptured animals remains constant.

Studies which examine selection at both scales assume that between- and within-host selection are necessarily in conflict. We explicitly examine these ideas and assumptions using a model of within-host viral dynamics nested within a model of between-host disease dynamics.

Pathogens sometimes alter their exploitation strategies in response to defensive strategies adopted by their host and vice versa. Nevertheless, most game-theoretic models developed to explain the evolution of pathogen and host characteristics assume that no such plasticity occurs. Allowing for phenotypic plasticity in these models is difficult because one must focus on the evolution of pathogen and host reaction norms, and then allow for the potentially indefinite reciprocal changes in pathogen and host behaviour that occur during an infection as a result of their interacting reaction norms. Here, we begin to address these issues for a simple host-pathogen system in which the pathogen exhibits a level of virulence and the host exhibits a level of immune clearance. We find, quite generally, that plasticity promotes the evolution of higher levels of cooperation, in this case leading to reduced levels of both virulence and clearance. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

The model and master equation include Brownian motion, reproduction via binary fission, and an interaction-dependent death rate moderated by a competition kernel. Using simulations we compare this individual-based model with the simplest approximation, the spatial logistic equation. In the limit of strong diffusion the spatial logistic equation is a good approximation to the model. However, in the limit of weak diffusion the spatial logistic equation is inaccurate because of spontaneous clustering driven by reproduction. The weak-diffusion limit can be partially analyzed using an exact solution of the master equation applicable to a competition kernel with infinite range. This analysis shows that in the case of a top-hat kernel, reducing the diffusion can increase the total population. For a Gaussian kernel, reduced diffusion invariably reduces the total population.

We define coexistence as a fixed point of the community dynamics with no population having zero size. It is demonstrated that the parameter range allowing coexistence shrinks and disappears when the Jacobian of the dynamics decreases to zero. A general notion of regulating factors/variables is introduced. For each population, its impact and sensitivity niches are defined as the differential impact on, and the differential sensitivity towards, the regulating variables, respectively. Either the similarity of the impact niches or the similarity of the sensitivity niches results in a small Jacobian and in a reduced likelihood of coexistence. For the case of a resource continuum, this result reduces to the usual "limited niche overlap" picture for both kinds of niche. As an extension of these ideas to the coexistence of infinitely many species, we demonstrate that Roughgarden's example for coexistence of a continuum of populations is structurally unstable. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

At low densities dispersers are less likely to find mates and establish new breeding units.

Our objective is to derive a spatially explicit mathematical model, where dispersers have a reduced probability of finding mates at low densities, and parameterize the model for wolf recolonization in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE). In this model, only the probability of establishing new breeding units is influenced by the reduced probability of finding mates at low densities. We analytically and numerically solve the model to determine the effect of a decreased probability in finding mates at low densities on population spread rate and density. Our results suggest that a reduced probability of finding mates at low densities may slow recolonization rate. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Matrix-based models lie at the core of many applications across the physical, engineering and life sciences. In ecology, matrix models arise naturally via population projection matrices (PPM). The eigendata of PPMs provide detailed quantitative and qualitative information on the dynamic behaviour of model populations, especially their asymptotic rates of growth or decline. A fundamental task in modern ecology is to assess the effect that perturbations to life-cycle transition rates of individuals have on such eigendata. The prevailing assessment tools in ecological applications of PPMs are direct matrix simulations of eigendata and linearised extrapolations to the typically non-linear relationship between perturbation magnitude and the resulting matrix eigenvalues. In recent years, mathematical systems theory has developed an analytical framework, called 'Robustness Analysis and Robust Control', encompassing also algorithms and numerical tools. This framework provides a systematic and precise approach to studying perturbations and uncertainty in systems represented by matrices. Here we lay down the foundations and concepts for a 'robustness' inspired approach to predictive analyses in population ecology. We treat a number of application-specific perturbation problems and show how they can be formulated and analysed using these robustness methodologies. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

When noise is demographic, we argue that variance around the expectation is proportional to the expectation. When noise is environmental the variance depends in a non-trivial way on how variation enters into model parameters, but we argue that if the environment affects the population multiplicatively then variance is proportional to the square of the expectation. We compare various stochastic analogues of the Ricker map model by fitting them, using maximum likelihood estimation, to data generated from an individual-based model and the weevil data of Utida. Our demographic models are significantly better than our environmental models at fitting noise generated by population processes where noise is mainly demographic. However, the traditionally chosen stochastic analogues to deterministic models-additive normally distributed noise and multiplicative lognormally distributed noise-generally fit all data sets well. Thus, the form of the variance does play a role in the fitting of models to ecological time series, but may not be important in practice as first supposed. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {We consider a large population of asexual organisms characterised by a number of quantitative traits that are subject to stabilising selection. Mutation is taken to act pleiotropically, with every mutation generally changing all of the traits under selection. We focus on the equilibrium distribution of the population, where mutation and selection are in balance. It has been previously established that the equilibrium distribution of genotypic effects may be anomalous, as it may contain a singular spike-a Dirac delta function-corresponding to a non-zero proportion of the population having exactly optimal genotypic values. In the present work, we present exact results for the case where three traits are under selection. These results give the equilibrium genetic variance of the population, and the proportion of the population that have the optimal genotype. This is achieved for two different spherically symmetric distributions of mutant effects. Additionally, a simple and robust numerical approach is also presented that allows the treatment of some other mutation distributions, where there are an arbitrary number of selected traits. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {Based on a population genetic model of mixed strategies determined by alleles of small effect, we derive conditions for the evolution of social learning in an infinite-state environment that changes periodically over time. Each mixed strategy is defined by the probabilities that an organism will commit itself to individual learning, social learning, or innate behavior. We identify the convergent stable strategies (CSS) by a numerical adaptive dynamics method and then check the evolutionary stability (ESS) of these strategies. A strategy that is simultaneously a CSS and an ESS is called an attractive ESS (AESS). For certain parameter sets, a bifurcation diagram shows that the pure individual learning strategy is the unique AESS for short periods of environmental change, a mixed learning strategy is the unique AESS for intermediate periods, and a mixed learning strategy (with a relatively large social learning component) and the pure innate strategy are both AESS's for long periods. This result entails that, once social learning emerges during a transient era of intermediate environmental periodicity, a subsequent elongation of the period may result in the intensification of social learning, rather than a return to innate behavior. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

We assume that the defense is of all-or-nothing type but that the probability for a prey individual to express the defended phenotype increases gradually with predator density. Compared to a defense that is independent of predation risk, an inducible defense facilitates persistence of the predator-prey system. In particular, inducibility reduces the minimal strength of the defense required for persistence. It also promotes stability by damping predator-prey cycles, but there are exceptions to this result: first, a strong inducible defense leads to the existence of multiple equilibria, and sometimes, to the destruction of stable equilibria. Second, a fast increase in the proportion of defended prey can create predator-prey cycles as the result of an over-compensating negative feedback. Non-equilibrium dynamics of the model are extremely complex. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Going beyond, segregation mechanisms, as a result from competition, combined with subsequent species differentiation, as a consequence from territorial heterogeneities - after a certain number of generations - might ultimately explain the extraordinary biodiversity of the Earth's biosphere, which seems to be confirmed by fossil registers in zoo-paleontology.

	abstract = {How does taking the full course of antibiotics prevent antibiotic resistant bacteria establishing in patients? We address this question by testing the possibility that horizontal/lateral gene transfer (HGT) is critical for the accumulation of the antibiotic-resistance phenotype while bacteria are under antibiotic stress. Most antibiotics prevent bacterial reproduction, some by preventing de novo gene expression. Nevertheless, in some cases and at some concentrations, the effects of most antibiotics on gene expression may not be irreversible. If the stress is removed before the bacteria are cleared from the patients by normal turnover, gene expression restarts, converting the residual population to phenotypic resistance. Using mathematical models we investigate how static recipients of resistance genes carried by plasmids accumulate resistance genes, and how specifically an environment cycling between presence and absence of the antibiotic uniquely favors the evolution of horizontally mobile resistance genes. We found that the presence of static recipients can substantially increase the persistence of the plasmid and that this effect is most pronounced when the cost of carriage of the plasmid decreases the cell's growth rate by as much as a half or more. In addition, plasmid persistence can be enhanced even when conjugation rates are as low as half the rate required for the plasmid to persist as a parasite on its own. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

The model assumes that bacteria choose substrates in order to maximize their per capita population growth rate. For batch bacterial growth, the model predicts that as the concentration of the preferred substrate decreases there will be a time at which both substrates provide bacteria with the same fitness and both substrates will be used simultaneously thereafter. Preferences for either substrate are computed as a function of substrate concentrations. The predicted time of switching is calculated for some experimental data given in the literature and it is shown that the fit between predicted and observed values is good. For bacterial growth in the chemostat, the model predicts that at low dilution rates bacteria should feed on both substrates while at higher dilution rates bacteria should feed on the preferred substrate only. Adaptive use of substrates permits bacteria to survive in the chemostat at higher dilution rates when compared with non-adaptive bacteria. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The method is based on a systematic perturbation expansion around the deterministic, non-spatial mean-field theory, using the theory of distributions to account for space and the underlying stochastic differential equations to account for stochasticity. As an example, we consider a spatial version of the Levins metapopulation model, in which the habitat patches are distributed in the d-dimensional landscape Rd in a random (but possibly correlated) manner. Assuming that the dispersal kernel is characterized by a length scale L, we examine how the behavior of the metapopulation deviates from the mean-field model for a finite but large L. For example, we show that the equilibrium fraction of occupied patches is given by p0+c/Ld+O(L-3d/2), where p0 is the equilibrium state of the Levins model and the constant c depends on p 0, the dispersal kernel, and the structure of the landscape. We show that patch occupancy can be increased or decreased by spatial structure, but is always decreased by stochasticity. Comparison with simulations show that the analytical results are not only asymptotically exact (as L→∞), but a good approximation also when L is relatively small. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Single species models with Allee effects (positive density dependence at low density) have also been shown to exhibit complex dynamics when combined with overcompensatory density dependence or a narrow fertility window. Here we present a simple two-stage model with Allee effects which shows large amplitude periodic fluctuations for some initial conditions, without these requirements. Periodicity arises out of a tension between the critical equilibrium of each stage, i.e. when the initial population vector is such that the adult stage is above the critical value, while the juvenile stage is below the critical value. Within this area of parameter space, the range of initial conditions giving rise to periodic dynamics is driven mainly by adult mortality rates. Periodic dynamics become more important as adult mortality increases up to a certain point, after which periodic dynamics are replaced by extinction. This model has more realistic life history parameter values than most 'chaotic' models. Conditions for periodic dynamics might arise in some marine species which are exploited (high adult mortality) leading to recruitment limitation (low juvenile density) and might be an additional source of extinction risk. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {A quantitative model of the US colonization in the 19th century is presented. We explore the idea that landscape heterogeneities should have strongly affected this process, as the need for water made the colonizers follow the routes of main rivers and set up their towns near them. So, we study transport processes on fractal networks modeling river basins, a case which may have a great ecological relevance for the study of hydrochory, and in general for species which spread along corridors. The analytical reaction-diffusion model presented here allows to predict the propagation rate of fronts spreading through Peano-like basins, and comparison with the Optimal Channels Network model is also reported. Finally, the propagation rates observed are compared with the results from our model, concluding that migration through fractal media, in spite of being a mathematical idealization of the problem, mimics the dynamics of real systems reasonably well. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {Intraguild predation is the simplest, ubiquitous form of trophic omnivory, known to greatly influence the structure and functioning of natural and managed food webs. Although alternative states are fundamental to intraguild predation dynamics, only necessary conditions for alternative states have been previously reported. Using simple models, we found complex but systematic patterns in which different alternative states occur along a productivity gradient, and clarified the sufficient conditions to separate these patterns. We found that two quantities known to control the necessary conditions also determine the sufficient conditions: (1) relative energy transfer efficiency through alternative trophic pathways to an intraguild predator, and (2) relative resource exploitation ability between intraguild prey and predator. These governing quantities suggest how body size and stoichiometric relations between intraguild prey and predators can influence the possibility of alternative states. Our results indicate that food webs involving intraguild predation have a high potential of complex alternative states, and their management can be highly precarious. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {A forward diffusion equation describing the evolution of the allele frequency spectrum is presented. The influx of mutations is accounted for by imposing a suitable boundary condition. For a Wright-Fisher diffusion with or without selection and varying population size, the boundary condition is limx ↓ 0 xf (x, t) = θ ρ (t), where f (·, t) is the frequency spectrum of derived alleles at independent loci at time t and ρ (t) is the relative population size at time t. When population size and selection intensity are independent of time, the forward equation is equivalent to the backwards diffusion usually used to derive the frequency spectrum, but this approach allows computation of the time dependence of the spectrum both before an equilibrium is attained and when population size and selection intensity vary with time. From the diffusion equation, a set of ordinary differential equations for the moments of f (·, t) is derived and the expected spectrum of a finite sample is expressed in terms of those moments. The use of the forward equation is illustrated by considering neutral and selected alleles in a highly simplified model of human history. For example, it is shown that approximately 30% of the expected total heterozygosity of neutral loci is attributable to mutations that arose since the onset of population growth in roughly the last 150, 000 years. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

We show that in case of weak symmetry evolutionary branching can lead to the emergence of two asymmetric variants, which are mirror images of each other, and the loss of the symmetric ancestor. We also show that in case of strong symmetry, evolutionary branching can occur into a symmetric and an asymmetric variant, both of which survive. The latter, asymmetric branching differs from the generic branching patterns of AD, which is always symmetric.

We discuss three special cases involving the evolution of sex allocation under fixed levels of dispersal between habitats. In these special cases, stable sex-allocation behaviors can be both biased and unbiased. When sex-allocation behavior and dispersal rates co-evolve we identify two basic outcomes. First-when sex-specific differences in the consequences of spatial heterogeneity are large-we predict the evolution of biased sex-allocation behavior in both habitats, with dispersal by males in one direction and dispersal by females in the other direction. Second-when sex-specific differences are small-unbiased sex-allocation is predicted with no dispersal between habitats. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

They harm their hosts by causing mutations or genomic rearrangements, and most organisms have evolved various mechanisms to suppress their activity. The evolutionary dynamics of transposons in insects, fish, birds and mammals are dramatically different. Mammalian genomes contain few, very abundant but relatively inactive transposon strains, while Drosophila and fish species harbour diverse strains, which typically have low abundance but are much more virulent. We hypothesise that the variation in the diversity and activity of transposable elements between various animal genomes is caused by the differences in the host defence mechanisms against transposon activity. In recent years RNAi, a mechanism capable of gene, virus and transposon silencing has been discovered. We model RNAi as a density dependant mechanism of defence, which can cause competition among transposons depending on its specificity, and test its predictions using the complete Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, Fugu rubripes, chicken, mouse, rat and human genome sequences. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

In this study we focus on cultural niche construction in a metapopulation (a population of populations), where the frequency of one cultural trait (e.g. the level of education) determines the transmission rate of a second trait (e.g. the adoption of fertility reduction preferences) within and between populations. We formulate the Metapopulation Cultural Niche Construction (MPCNC) model by defining the cultural niche induced by the first trait as the construction of a social interaction network on which the second trait may percolate. Analysis of the model reveals dynamics that are markedly different from those observed in a single population, allowing, for example, different (or even opposing) dynamics in each population. In particular, this model can account for the puzzling phenomenon reported in previous studies [Bongaarts, J., Watkins, S., 1996. Social interactions and contemporary fertility transitions. Popul.

Changes in the disturbance frequency are shown to generate a period-bubbling bifurcation structure and population dynamics that are most variable at intermediate disturbance frequencies.

Here we provide a general analytic solution to the local community model of Hubbell's neutral theory of biodiversity by recasting it as an urn model, i.e. a Markovian description of states and their transitions. Both stationary and time-dependent distributions are analysed. The stationary distribution - also called the zero-sum multinomial - is given in closed form. An approximate form for the time-dependence is obtained by using an expansion of the master equation.

	abstract = {Spatial structure of genetic variation within populations is well measured by statistics based on the distribution of pairs of individual genotypes, and various such statistics have been widely used in experimental studies. However, the problem of uncharacterized correlations among statistics for different alleles has limited the applications of multiallelic, multilocus summary measures, since these had unknown sampling distributions. Usually multiple alleles and/or multiple loci are required in order to precisely measure spatial structures, and to provide precise indirect estimates of the amount of dispersal in samples of reasonable size. This article examines the correlations among pair-wise statistics, including Moran I-statistics and various measures of conditional kinship, for different alleles of a locus. First the correlations are mathematically derived for random spatial distributions, which allow averages over alleles and loci to be used as more powerful yet exact test statistics for the null hypothesis. Then extensive computer simulations are conducted to examine the correlations among values for different alleles under isolation by distance processes. For loci with more than three alleles, the results show that the correlations are remarkably and perhaps surprisingly small, establishing the principle that then alleles behave as nearly independent realizations of space-time stochastic processes. The results also show that the correlations are largely robust with respect to the degree of spatial structure, and they can be used in a straightforward manner to form confidence intervals for averages. The results allow a precise connection between observations in experimental studies and levels of dispersal in theoretical models. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {One of the major approaches to understanding spatial effects in ecology and population dynamics is the use of analytic models. Some types of analytic models for spatial effects, such as dispersal models based on partial differential equations or integral kernels, can capture transient behavior and can be easily extended to incorporate population dynamics. Others, such as the ideal-free distribution or the species-area relationship derived from island biogeography theory, only provide equilibrium descriptions of the distribution of organisms or species but do not describe dynamic processes. The goal of this paper is to formulate a class of models based on partial differential equations whose equilibria are solutions to a version of the ideal-free distribution set in continuous space. One motivation is to formulate a dynamic version of the ideal-free distribution which can be compared with or incorporated into other sorts of dynamic models such as reaction-diffusion systems. Another motivation is to show how the global predictions of the ideal-free distribution can arise from simple assumptions about local dispersal behavior. The main results are derivations of partial differential equations using ideas related to Fick's law for diffusion, and alternatively by taking a continuum limit of a discrete model, and a verification that under appropriate hypotheses the solutions to those partial differential equations approach equilibria that satisfy the ideal-free distribution. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

This may lead to speciation in three steps: (i) colonization of a new habitat, (ii) genetic divergence of the two groups by adaptation to the habitats, and (iii) a decrease of genetic mixing between the lineages (similar to reinforcement). In a previous paper we showed that steps (i) and (ii) occur readily for a wide range of fixed mating and habitat preferences. Here, we study whether this can ultimately lead to speciation through selective changes in these preferences. We show that this indeed occurs, and, furthermore, it is very general: for a large class of models there is selection toward producing young more frequently in the natal habitat. Once habitat preference is strong, there is selection toward stronger assortative mating. Even when steps (i) and (ii) initially fail, genetic divergence may succeed at a later evolutionary stage, after which a decrease of genetic mixing completes speciation. Our results show that speciation by the learning of habitat features is an extremely effective mechanism. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The impact of temporally correlated fluctuating environments (coloured noise) on the extinction risk of populations has become a main focus in theoretical population ecology. In this study we particularly focus on the extinction risk in strongly correlated environments. Here, we found that, in contrast to moderate auto-correlation, the extinction risk was highly dependent on the process of noise generation, in particular on the method of variance scaling. Such scaling is commonly applied to avoid variance-driven biases when comparing the extinction risk under white and coloured noise. We show that for strong auto-correlation often-used scaling techniques lead to a high variability in the variances of the resulting time series and thus to deviations in the subsequent extinction risk. Therefore, we present an alternative scaling method that always delivers the target variance, even in the case of strong auto-correlation. In contrast to earlier techniques, our very intuitive method is not bound to auto-regressive processes but can be applied to all types of coloured noises. We strongly recommend our method to generate time series when the target of interest is the effect of noise colour on extinction risk not obscured by any variance effects. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

We suggest that many humans have a predisposition to punish those who violate group-beneficial norms, even when this imposes a fitness cost on the punisher. Such altruistic punishment is widely observed to sustain high levels of cooperation in behavioral experiments and in natural settings. We offer a model of cooperation and punishment that we call strong reciprocity: where members of a group benefit from mutual adherence to a social norm, strong reciprocators obey the norm and punish its violators, even though as a result they receive lower payoffs than other group members, such as selfish agents who violate the norm and do not punish, and pure cooperators who adhere to the norm but free-ride by never punishing. Our agent-based simulations show that, under assumptions approximating likely human environments over the 100,000 years prior to the domestication of animals and plants, the proliferation of strong reciprocators when initially rare is highly likely, and that substantial frequencies of all three behavioral types can be sustained in a population. As a result, high levels of cooperation are sustained. Our results do not require that group members be related or that group extinctions occur. © 2003 Published by Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {It is well recognized that individuals of many species can benefit from the presence of conspecifics, a concept broadly referred to as the Allee effect. At the metapopulation level, there is an analogous but essentially different phenomenon called the Allee-like effect that leads to metapopulation extinction thresholds at low habitat occupancy. But so far not adequate attention has been paid to this phenomenon. In this paper, the Allee-like effect is introduced into a metapopulation model of one species and also that of a three-state two-species competitive system. Phase plane analysis is used to investigate the dynamics of these models. We demonstrate that the Allee-like effect alone could lead to multiple stable states in three-state two-species competitive systems at the metapopulation level, and the number of stable states decrease as the Allee-like effect becomes more severe. Severe Allee-like effects may make coexistence impossible and may even lead to the extinction of both species even if their initial habitat occupancies are high and suitable habitats are enough. It is especially noticeable that depending on their initial conditions one species may exclude the other one that subjects to a weaker Allee-like effect than the former, while the second species always excludes the first one when both species are assumed to be in the absence of the Allee-like effect. We also investigate the habitat destructive effect on the Allee-like system mentioned above. Research indicates that the existence of the Allee-like effect makes a metapopulation more susceptible to habitat destruction. All in all, the Allee-like effect is probably a destabilizing factor that, together with habitat destruction, would affect the continuous existence of species. These conclusions may have important implications for conservation and metacommunity organization. © 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

We show that an important qualitative feature common to empirical mortality data, and which has been found in certain models - the convergence to a "mortality plateau" - is, in fact, a generic consequence of the models' convergence to a "quasistationary distribution". This phenomenon has been explored extensively in the mathematical literature. Not only does this generalization free important results from specifics of the models, it also suggests a new explanation for the convergence to constant mortality. At the same time that we show that the late behavior of these models - convergence to a finite asymptote - is almost logically immutable, we also point out that the early behavior of the mortality rates can be more flexible than has been generally acknowledged. We show, in particular, that an appropriate choice of initial conditions enables one popular model to approximate any reasonable hazard-rate data. This illustrates how precarious it can be to read a model's vindication from its consilience with a favored hazard-rate function, such as the Gompertz exponential. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

It involves two quite distinct aspects: a formulation of a theoretical framework for calculating space-time averages, and an acquisition of data to support that framework. In this paper, we address the theoretical part of the question, and although our primary motivation was an understanding of carbon accounting our formulation is more general. To that end, we adopt a dynamical systems approach, and incorporate a new dynamical formulation of self-thinning. We show how to calculate rates of change for total (and average) plant dry mass, volume, and carbon, in terms of the properties of the individual plants. The results emphasize how local scale statistics (such as, variation in the size of individuals) lead to nonlinear variation at larger scales. Further, we describe how regular and stochastic disturbance can be readily incorporated into this framework. It is shown that stochastic disturbance at patch-scales, results in (to first approximation) regular disturbance at ecosystem scales, and hence can be formulated as such. We conclude that a dynamical formulation of self-thinning can be used as a generic framework for scaling ecological processes in space and time. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In density-independent models, the population growth rate λ measures population performance, and the perturbation analysis of λ (its sensitivity and elasticity) plays an important role in demography. In density-dependent models, the invasion exponent logλI replaces λ as a measure of population performance. The perturbation analysis of λI reveals the effects of environmental changes and management actions, gives the direction and intensity of density-dependent natural selection on life history traits, and permits calculation of the sampling variance of the invasion exponent. Because density-dependent models require more data than density-independent models, it is tempting to look for substitutes for the invasion exponent, the sensitivity and elasticity of which can be calculated from a density-independent model. Here we examine the accuracy of two such substitutes: the dominant eigenvalue of the projection matrix evaluated at equilibrium (An̂) and the dominant eigenvalue of the matrix averaged over the attractor (Ā). Using a two-stage model that represents a wide range of life history types, we find that the elasticities of A n̂ or Ā often agree to within less than 5% error with those of the invasion exponent, even when population dynamics are chaotic. The exceptions are for semelparous life histories, especially when density-dependence affects fertility. This suggests that the elasticity analysis of density-independent models near equilibrium, or averaged over the attractor, provides useful information about the elasticity of the invasion exponent in density-dependent models. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {We consider family specific fitnesses that depend on mixed strategies of two basic phenotypes or behaviours. Pairwise interactions are assumed, but they are restricted to occur between sibs. To study the change in frequency of a rare mutant allele, we consider two different forms of weak selection, one applied through small differences in genotypic values determining individual mixed strategies, the other through small differences in viabilities according to the behaviours chosen by interacting sibs. Under these two specific forms of weak selection, we deduce conditions for initial increase in frequency of a rare mutant allele for autosomal genes in the partial selfing model as well as autosomal and sex-linked genes in the partial sib-mating model with selection before mating or selection after mating. With small differences in mixed strategies, we show that conditions for protection of a mutant allele are tantamount to conditions for initial increase in frequency obtained in additive kin selection models. With particular reference to altruism versus selfishness, we provide explicit ranges of values for the selfing or sib-mating rate based on a fixed cost-benefit ratio and the dominance scheme that allow the spreading of a rare mutant allele into the population. This study confirms that more inbreeding does not necessarily promote the evolution of altruism. Under the hypothesis of small differences in viabilities, the situation is much more intricate unless an additive model is assumed. In general however, conditions for initial increase in frequency of a mutant allele can be obtained in terms of fitness effects that depend on the genotypes of interacting individuals or their mates and generalized conditional coefficients of relatedness according to the inbreeding condition of the interacting individuals. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

The genetic statistics for distinguishing the two types of zones are the deviations of one- or two-locus genotypic frequencies from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) or from random association of gametes (RAG), and the deviations of additive and dominance variances from the values at HWE. These deviations have a discontinuous distribution in space and different extents of interruptions in the ecological zone with a sharp boundary, but exhibit a continuous distribution in the tension zone. Linkage disequilibrium enhances the difference between the deviations from HWE and from RAG for any two-locus genotypic frequency. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

By adapting the numerical method we can, at the expense of a significantly increased computing time, also capture the branching event in which a monomorphic population turns dimorphic and subsequently follow the evolution of the two traits in the dimorphic population. From the beginning we concentrate on a caricatural yet interesting model for competition for two resources. This provides the perhaps simplest example of branching and has the great advantage that it can be analyzed and understood in detail. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

We considered in our model male and female life-history traits when both separated and together. The model showed that both male/female individual ratio and male/female genotype ratio of S. mansoni adults are biased toward males in each combination. This bias was more important in male/female genotype ratio than in the male/female individual ratio for the same initial values of cercarial development success. This model could explain the sex specific population structure of this parasite. Firstly, we showed that the male-biased individual ratio finds its origin in the vertebrate host.

This approximation is used to explore how spatially structured habitats can affect competition intensity. The competition landscape is then compared to a simulation of mussel colonization under various flow velocity patterns, and is shown to predict the qualitative effect of the scale of patchiness in habitat quality on total competition intensity. The interaction between large scale hydrodynamic forcing and local competition is also shown to provide an alternate hypothesis explaining the observed among-year reversal of the relationship between topographic scale and mussel abundance in some intertidal communities. The model more generally highlights the nonlinear scaling up of competitive interactions in competition landscapes, and provides a framework for the study of self-organization in heterogeneous ecosystems. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

In this paper, we select two classical models describing predator-prey systems and introduce the Allee effects into the dynamics of both the predator and prey populations in these models, respectively. By combining mathematical analysis with numerical simulation, we have shown that the Allee effect may be a destabilizing force in predator-prey systems: the equilibrium point of the system could be changed from stable to unstable or otherwise, the system, even when it is stable, will take much longer time to reach the stable state. We also conclude that the equilibrium of the prey population will be enlarged due to the Allee effect of the predator, but the Allee effects of the prey may decrease the equilibrium value of the predator, or that of both the predator and prey. It should also be pointed out that the impact of the Allee effects of predator and prey due to different mechanisms on different predator-prey systems could also vary. © 2004 Published by Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {It has long been realised that the standard assumptions of mass-action mixing are a crude approximation of the true mechanistic processes that govern the transmission of infection. In particular, many infections can be considered to be spread through a limited network of contacts. Yet, despite the underlying discrepancies, mass-action models continue to be used and provide a remarkably accurate description of epidemic behaviour. Here, the differences between mass-action and network-based models are investigated. This allows us to determine when mass-action models are a reliable tool, and suggest ways in which their behaviour should be refined. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {We present a model of predator and prey grouping strategies using game theory. As predators respond strategically to prey behavior and vice versa, the model is based on a co-evolution approach. Focusing on the "many eyes-many mouths" trade-off, this model considers the benefits and costs of being in a group for hunting predators and foraging prey: predators in a group have more hunting success than solitary predators but they have to share the prey captured; prey in a group face a lower risk of predation but greater competition for resources than lone prey. The analysis of the model shows that the intersections of four curves define distinct areas in the parameter space, corresponding to different strategies used by predators and prey at equilibrium. The model predictions are in accordance with empirical evidence that an open habitat encourages group living, and that low risks of predation favor lone prey. Under some conditions, continuous cycling of the relative frequencies of the different strategies may occur. In this situation, the proportions of grouped vs. solitary predators and prey oscillate over time. © 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Unlike in models that take individual behavior as given and fixed, the endemic equilibrium prevalence need not vary monotonically with respect to the basic reproductive number. Specifically, with endogenously determined self-protective behavior, a reduction in the basic reproductive number may in fact increase the endemic equilibrium prevalence. The global stability of the endemic steady state is established for the case of a homogeneous population by showing that, for any non-zero initial disease prevalence, there exists an equilibrium path which converges to the endemic steady state. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

The basic question of whether two components are coupled (exhibit dynamical interdependence) is relevant to investigations of movement of animals over space, population regulation, food webs and trophic interactions, and is also useful in the design of monitoring programs. For example, in spatially extended systems, coupling among populations in different locations implies the existence of redundant information in the system and the possibility of exploiting this redundancy in the development of spatial sampling designs. One approach to the identification of coupling involves study of the purported mechanisms linking system components. Another approach is based on time series of two potential components of the same system and, in previous ecological work, has relied on linear cross-correlation analysis. Here we present two different attractor-based approaches, continuity and mutual prediction, for determining the degree to which two population time series (e.g., at different spatial locations) are coupled. Both approaches are demonstrated on a one-dimensional predator-prey model system exhibiting complex dynamics. Of particular interest is the spatial asymmetry introduced into the model as linearly declining resource for the prey over the domain of the spatial coordinate. Results from these approaches are then compared to the more standard cross-correlation analysis. In contrast to cross-correlation, both continuity and mutual prediction are clearly able to discern the asymmetry in the flow of information through this system.},

	abstract = {Maintaining an adaptive seasonality, with life cycle events occurring at appropriate times of year and in synchrony with cohorts and ephemeral resources, is a basic ecological requisite for many cold-blooded organisms. There are many mechanisms for synchronizing developmental milestones, such as egg laying (oviposition), egg hatching, cocoon opening, and the emergence of adults. These are often irreversible, specific to particular life stages, and include diapause, an altered physiological state which can be reversed by some synchronizing environmental cue (e.g. photoperiod). However, many successful organisms display none of these mechanisms for maintaining adaptive seasonality. In this paper, we briefly review the mathematical relationship between environmental temperatures and developmental timing and discuss the consequences of viewing these models as circle maps from the cycle of yearly oviposition dates and temperatures to oviposition dates for subsequent generations. Of particular interest biologically are life cycles which are timed to complete in exactly 1 year, or univoltine cycles. Univoltinism, associated with reproductive success for many temperate species, is related to stable fixed points of the developmental circle map. Univoltine fixed points are stable and robust in broad temperature bands, but lose stability suddenly to maladaptive cycles at the edges of these bands. Adaptive seasonality may therefore break down with little warning with constantly increasing or decreasing temperature change, as in scenarios for global warming. These ideas are illustrated and explored in the context of Mountain Pine Beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) occurring in the marginal thermal habitat of central Idaho's Rocky Mountains. Applications of these techniques have not been widely explored by the applied math community, but are likely to provide great insight into the response of biological systems to climate change. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Two necessary requisites to obtain this result are: (i) a small population or a large subdivided metapulation and (ii) an asymmetry between partners in such a way that one of them (donor) proposes the cooperation and elects the partner, whereas the other (receiver) never rejects the offer.

Provided an infinitely large unsubdivided population and no frequency-dependance of selective values, heterozygote advantage is the text book explanation for the maintenance of polymorphism when selection acts at a diallelic locus. Here, we investigate whether this remains true when selection acts at multiple diallelic loci. We use five different definitions of heterozygote advantage that largely cover this concept for multiple loci. Using extensive numerical simulations, we found no clear associations between the presence of any of the five definitions of heterozygote advantage and the maintenance of polymorphism at all loci. The strength of the association decreases as the number of loci increases or as recombination decreases. We conclude that heterozygote advantage cannot be a general mechanism for the maintenance of genetic polymorphism at multiple loci. These findings suggest that a correlation between the number of heterozygote loci and fitness is not warranted on theoretical ground. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

In this article, therefore, we study a metapopulation model for consumers with a fitness trade-off between two habitats. We focus on effects of habitat abundance, dispersal rate and trade-off strength on the evolution of specialisation under two types of trade-off. Adaptation affects either the intrinsic growth rates r or the carrying capacities K. Depending on dispersal rate and trade-off strength, evolution can result in one generalist, one specialist or two specialist types. Higher dispersal rate and a weaker trade-off favour the evolution of a generalist, for both trade-off structures. However, we also find differences between the two trade-off structures. Our results are qualitatively similar to analyses of two-patch models, suggesting that insights from such simpler models can be extrapolated to metapopulation models. Additional effects, however, occur because in classical metapopulations patch lifetime depends on extinction rate. Counterintuitively, this favours the evolution of specialisation when the trade-off affects r. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

However, one of the major drawbacks with these pathogens as biocontrol agents is that they have a slow response time. Alterations to the speed of kill and pathogen life history characteristics can influence the competitive outcome and persistence between wildtype and modified strains. Here, we explore, theoretically, how life-history modifications of pathogens can affect the epidemiology and ecology of strain coexistence. In particular, we show how under simple mass action disease transmission, life-history difference between strains are insufficient to allow coexistence. Additional heterogeneities in transmission are shown to be necessary to facilitate coexistence of wildtype and modified pathogen strains. We also illustrate how the patterns of infectivity of wildtype and modified strains can also affect long-term coexistence, and argue that appropriate assessment of genetic modifications must be presented in terms of relevant ecological theory. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {The commonness of omnivory in natural communities is puzzling, because simple dynamic models of tri-trophic systems with omnivory are prone to species extinction. In particular, the intermediate consumer is frequently excluded by the omnivore at high levels of enrichment. It has been suggested that adaptive foraging by the omnivore may facilitate coexistence, because the intermediate consumer should persist more easily if it is occasionally dropped from the omnivore's diet. We explore theoretically how species permanence in tri-trophic systems is affected if the omnivore forages adaptively according to the "diet rule", i.e., feeds on the less profitable of its two prey species only if the more profitable one is sufficiently rare. We show that, compared to systems where omnivory is fixed, adaptive omnivory may indeed facilitate 3-species persistence. Counter to intuition, however, facilitation of 3-species coexistence requires that the intermediate consumer is a more profitable prey than the basal resource. Consequently, adaptive omnivory does not facilitate persistence of the intermediate consumer but enlarges the persistence region of the omnivore towards parameter space where a fixed omnivore would be excluded by the intermediate consumer. Overall, the positive effect of adaptive omnivory on 3-species persistence is, however, small. Generally, whether omnivory is fixed or adaptive, 3-species permanence is most likely when profitability (=conversion efficiency into omnivores) is low for basal resources and high for intermediate consumers. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

We develop a multi-species community model with an evolving landscape in which the creation and destruction of habitat are dynamic and local in space. Species interactions are also local involving hierarchical competitive trade-offs. We show that dynamic landscapes can reverse the trend of increasing species richness with higher fragmentation observed in static landscapes. The increase in the species-area exponent from a homogeneous to a fragmented landscape does not occur when dynamics are turned on. Thus, temporal aspects of the processes that generate and destroy habitat appear dominant relative to spatial characteristics. We also demonstrate, however, that temporal and spatial aspects interact to influence the persistence time of individual species, and therefore, rank-abundance curves. Specifically, persistence in the model increases in habitats with faster local turnover because of the presence of dynamic corridors. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

One potential explanation is that these are statistical expectations over the range of potential species characteristics. We systematically examine the indirect interactions between two hosts with a shared parasitoid across all potential parameter values, using a family of simple models. By including a detection limit for nonzero interspecific effects, we demonstrate that (-,0) indirect interactions between hosts are the most common type for many variants of the model.

We present a model of a simple food web, consisting of a resource, a consumer, and its predator. We assume that the predator has a direct positive effect on the consumer, by increasing the rate at which the consumer acquires resources. We consider two cases: the feedback strength is a saturating function of predator density, or it is proportional to the encounter rate between predators and prey. In both cases, the positive feedback is stabilizing, delaying or preventing the onset of oscillations due to enrichment. Positive feedback can introduce an Allee effect for the predator population, yielding multiple stable equilibria. Strong positive feedback can yield counterintuitive results such as a transient increase in consumer density following the introduction of predators, and a decrease in the resource pool following enrichment. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

Long-distance dispersal, which reduces intraspecific competition, is sometimes advantageous even where aggregation of suitable habitat would otherwise favor short-distance dispersal, although certain habitat distributions can lead to either strategy being dominant. Coexistence is also possible on some landscapes, where the spatial structure of the populations partitions suitable sites according to the number of suitable neighboring sites. Mutual competitive exclusion, where whichever strategy is established first cannot be invaded, is also possible.

In our model the condition of the organism is adversely affected by hard work, but can recover during easy periods. Our analysis concentrates on the effects of background mortality (i.e., mortality that cannot be avoided) on the optimal strategy and how often an organism following this strategy breeds. In particular, we are concerned with whether reproduction occurs at specific times of year (entrained to the annual cycle), and if so then how many reproductive bouts occur per year. We find that an increase in background mortality can have various effects. If the animal is entrained to the annual cycle and has one breeding attempt per year, then breeding tends to occur earlier and there may be two breeding attempts per season. Another possible outcome is that breeding is no longer entrained. If the animal is entrained but sometimes skips reproduction so that it does not breed every year, then an increase in mortality may make it more likely that the animal breeds every year. We show that as background mortality increases the resultant increase in the frequency of breeding contributes to the increase in annual mortality. We also explore the effects of mortality on the timing of reproduction within a year, highlighting the tension between the interests of the parent and that of the young. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {Influenza in humans is characterised by strongly annual dynamics and antigenic evolution leading to partial escape from prior host immunity. The variability of new epidemic strains depends on the amount of virus currently circulating. In this paper, the amount of antigenic variation produced each year is dependent on the epidemic size. Our model reduces to a one-dimensional map and a full mathematical analysis is presented. This simple system suggests some basic principles which may be more generally applicable. In particular, for diseases with antigenic drift, vaccination may be doubly beneficial. Not only does it protect the population through classical herd immunity, but the overall case reduction reduces the chance of new variants being produced; hence, subsequent epidemics may be milder as a result of this positive feedback. Also, a disease with a high innate rate of antigenic variation will always be able to invade a susceptible population, whereas a disease with less potential for variation may require several introduction events to become endemic. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

At one genetic locus, individuals may have one of a few gene sequences that convey an advantage while in the oasis at the cost of a disadvantage in the desert. The distribution of genetic states in the population, possibly localized in genome space around the oasis-adapted genotypes, is known as a quasispecies. We find that the ratio of oasis-adapted individuals to desert-adapted ones exhibits sharp transitions at particular oasis velocities. We calculate an extinction velocity, and a switching velocity above which the dominance switches from the oasis-adapted genotype to the desert-adapted one. This switching velocity is analogous to the quasispecies mutational error threshold. Above this velocity, the population cannot maintain adaptations to the properties of the oasis. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

We show that fitness is strongly dependent on the spatial arrangement of modules in both genetically homogeneous and heterogeneous organisms, and that the magnitude of the variation is dependent on the strength of interactions among modules. Organism fitness is more variable with interactions among modules that are symmetrical (each affects each other in the same directions) than with asymmetrical interactions (neighbors affect each other in different directions).

Thus, there is considerable interest in quantifying the strength of selection. A full likelihood approach for inference about selection at a single site within an otherwise neutral fully linked sequence of sites is described here. A coalescent model of evolution is used to model the ancestry of a sample of DNA sequences which have the selected site segregating. The mutation model, for the selected and neutral sites, is the infinitely many-sites model where there is no back or parallel mutation at sites. A unique perfect phylogeny, a gene tree, can be constructed from the configuration of mutations on the sample sequences under this model of mutation. The approach is general and can be used for any bi-allelic selection scheme. Selection is incorporated through modelling the frequency of the selected and neutral allelic classes stochastically back in time, then using a subdivided population model considering the population frequencies through time as variable population sizes. An importance sampling algorithm is then used to explore over coalescent tree space consistent with the data. The method is applied to a simulated data set and the gene tree presented in Verrelli et al. (2002). © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

It has been argued that individual learning, social learning, and innate determination of behavior are favored by natural selection when environmental changes occur at short, intermediate, and long intervals, respectively. Only recently, however, has the hypothesis been examined by means of mathematical models. In this paper, we construct a simple model in which each organism uses one of three genetically determined strategies - it is an individual learner, a social learner or an "innate" - and the three types of organisms are in direct competition with each other. A reduced model, involving only the individual learners and innates, is effectively linear, and we show that by solving the eigenvalue problem of this reduced system we arrive at a good approximation to the global dynamics of the full model. We also study the effect of stochastic environmental changes and reversible mutations among the three strategies. Our results are consistent with the predictions of previous studies. In addition, we identify a critical level of environmental constancy below which only individual and social learners are present. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {We investigate a mutualistic metacommunity where the strength of the mutualistic interaction between species is measured by the extent to which the presence of one species on a patch either reduces the extinction rate of the others present on the same patch or increases their ability to colonize other patches. In both cases, a strong enough mutualism enables all species to persist at habitat densities where they would all be extinct in the absence of the interaction. However, a mutualistic interaction that enhances colonization enables the species to persist at lower habitat density than one that suppresses extinction. All species abruptly go extinct (catastrophe) when the habitat density is decreased infinitesimally below a critical value. A comparison of the mean field or spatially implicit case with unrestricted dispersal and colonization to all patches in the system with a spatially explicit case where dispersal is restricted to the immediate neighbours of the original patch leads to the intriguing conclusion that restricted dispersal can be favourable for species that have a beneficial effect on each other when habitat conditions are adverse. When the mutualistic interaction is strong enough, the extinction threshold or critical amount of habitat required for the persistence of all species is lower when the dispersal is locally restricted than when unrestricted ! The persistence advantage for all species created by the mutualistic interaction increases substantially with the number of species in the metacommunity, as does the advantage for restricted dispersal over global dispersal. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

Reproduction occurs only in the stationary phase. Examples of such systems are found in rivers and streams, marine currents, and areas with prevalent wind direction. In streams, a long-standing question, dubbed 'the drift paradox', asks why aquatic insects faced with downstream drift are able to persist in upper stream reaches. For our two-phase model, persistence of the population is guaranteed if, at low population densities, the local growth rate of the stationary component of the population exceeds the rate of entry of individuals into the drift. Otherwise the persistence condition involves all the model parameters, and persistence requires a critical (minimum) domain size. We calculate the rate at which invasion fronts propagate up- and downstream, and show that persistence and ability to spread are closely connected: if the population cannot advance upstream against the flow, it also cannot persist on any finite spatial domain. By studying two limiting cases of our model, we show that residence in the immobile state always enhances population persistence. We use our findings to evaluate a number of mechanisms previously proposed in the ecological literature as resolutions of the drift paradox. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Sexually-transmitted diseases (STDs) constitute a major public health concern. Mathematical models for the transmission dynamics of STDs indicate that heterogeneity in sexual activity level allow them to persist even when the typical behavior of the population would not support endemicity. This insight focuses attention on the distribution of sexual activity level in a population. In this paper, we develop several stochastic process models for the formation of sexual partnership networks. Using likelihood-based model selection procedures, we assess the fit of the different models to three large distributions of sexual partner counts: (1) Rakai, Uganda, (2) Sweden, and (3) the USA. Five of the six single-sex networks were fit best by the negative binomial model. The American women's network was best fit by a power-law model, the Yule. For most networks, several competing models fit approximately equally well. These results suggest three conclusions: (1) no single unitary process clearly underlies the formation of these sexual networks, (2) behavioral heterogeneity plays an essential role in network structure, (3) substantial model uncertainty exists for sexual network degree distributions. Behavioral research focused on the mechanisms of partnership formation will play an essential role in specifying the best model for empirical degree distributions. We discuss the limitations of inferences from such data, and the utility of degree-based epidemiological models more generally. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Because of the inherent discreteness of individuals, population dynamical models must be discrete variable systems. In case of strong nonlinearity, such systems interacting with noise can generate a great variety of patterns from nearly periodic behavior through complex combination of nearly periodic and chaotic patterns to noisy chaotic time series. The interaction of a population consisting of discrete individuals and demographic noise has been analyzed in laboratory population data Henson et al. (Science 294 (2001) 602; Proc. Roy. Soc. Ser. B 270 (2003) 1549). In this paper we point out that some of the cycles are fragile, i.e. they are sensitive to the discretization algorithm and to small variation of the model parameters, while others remain "sturdy" against the perturbations. We introduce a statistical algorithm to detect disjoint, nearly-periodic patterns in data series. We show that only the sturdy cycles of the discrete variable models appear in the data series significantly. Our analysis identified the quasiperiodic 11-cycle (emerging in the continuous model) to be present significantly only in one of the three experimental data series. Numerical simulations confirm that cycles can be detected only if noise is smaller than a certain critical level and population dynamics display the largest variety of nearly-periodic patterns if they are on the border of "grey" and "noisy" regions, defined in Domokos and Scheuring (J.

	abstract = {This article is concerned with relating the stability of a population, as defined by the rate of decay of fluctuations induced by demographic stochasticity, with its heterogeneity in age-specific birth and death rates. We invoke the theory of large deviations to establish a fluctuation theorem: The demographic stability of a population is positively correlated with evolutionary entropy, a measure of the variability in the age of reproducing individuals in the population. This theorem is exploited to predict certain correlations between ecological constraints and evolutionary trends in demographic stability, namely, (i) bounded growth constraints - a uni-directional increase in stability, (ii) unbounded growth constraints (large population size) - a uni-directional decrease in stability, (iii) unbounded growth constraints (small population size) - random, non-directional change in stability. These principles relating ecological constraints with trends in demographic stability are shown to be far reaching generalizations of the tenets derived from classical studies of stability in an evolutionary context. These results thus provide a new conceptual framework for explaining patterns of variation in population numbers observed in natural populations. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

In a second approach, we introduce a phylogenetic estimator. Given the UPGMA topology, the likelihood of the parameter is computed thanks to a new dynamical programming method. By a proper correction, an unbiased estimator is derived from the pseudomaximum of the likelihood. The last approach consists of computing the likelihood by a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling method. In the one-dimensional Brownian motion, this method seems less reliable than pseudomaximum-likelihood. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The equilibrium structure of such an epistasis-modifying locus is studied. It is shown that under well-specified conditions a modifying allele that increases epistasis succeeds. In other words, genetic interactions tend to become stronger. It is speculated that this occurs because the mean fitness in such models is locally increasing as a function of the degree of epistasis. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The performance of the approximations are assessed using analytic techniques available for the simplest epidemiological model and using numerical simulations in more complex settings. We also present epidemiologically important extensions of previous work, considering variability in the SEIR model and in situations for which there is seasonal variation in disease transmission. Important implications of stochastic effects for the dynamics of childhood diseases are highlighted, including serious deficiencies of deterministic descriptions of dynamical behavior. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

Analysis of the model demonstrates that the explicit inclusion of space allows asymmetry between groups to arise when this was not possible in the equivalent spatially homogeneous system. Moreover, differences in movement behaviours for susceptible and infected individuals gives rise to different spatial profiles for the populations. These profiles were not observed in previous work on an epidemic system.

This index depends on a chosen matrix of dissimilarities among categories and a frequency distribution of these categories. With certain choices of dissimilarities, this index could be maximized over all frequency distributions by eliminating several categories. This unexpected result is radically opposite to those obtained with usual diversity indices. We demonstrate that the elimination of categories to maximize the quadratic entropy depends on mathematical properties of the chosen dissimilarities. In particular, when quadratic entropy is applied to ultrametric dissimilarities, all categories are retained in order to reach its maximal value. Three examples, varying from simple one-dimensional to ultrametric dissimilarity matrices, are provided. We conclude that, as far as diversity measurement is concerned, quadratic entropy is most relevant when applied to ultrametric dissimilarities. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Recognition of the microbial loop as an important part of aquatic ecosystems disrupted the notion of simple linear food chains. However, current research suggests that even the microbial loop paradigm is a gross simplification of microbial interactions due to the presence of mixotrophs - organisms that both photosynthesize and graze. We present a simple food web model with four trophic species, three of them arranged in a food chain (nutrients-autotrophs-herbivores) and the fourth as a mixotroph with links to both the nutrients and the autotrophs. This model is used to study the general implications of inclusion of the mixotrophic link in microbial food webs and the specific predictions for a parameterization that describes open ocean mixed layer plankton dynamics. The analysis indicates that the system parameters reside in a region of the parameter space where the dynamics converge to a stable equilibrium rather than displaying periodic or chaotic solutions. However, convergence requires weeks to months, suggesting that the system would never reach equilibrium in the ocean due to alteration of the physical forcing regime. Most importantly, the mixotrophic grazing link seems to stabilize the system in this region of the parameter space, particularly when nutrient recycling feedback loops are included. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Here we show how the separation of behavioral and ecological timescales allows one to determine both responses starting from an explicit behavioral model. Within the general set-up considered in this paper, the two functional responses can tend toward Holling type II responses when consumers react only weakly to predation. Thus, the main characteristics of the standard Rosenzweig-MacArthur tritrophic food chain (logistic resource and Holling type II consumer and predator) remain valid also when consumers have weak antipredator behavior. Moreover, through numerical analysis, we show that in a particular but interesting case pronounced antipredator behaviors stabilize the system. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

His approach explicitly excluded the possibility of density- and frequency-dependent selection.

We employ the same kind of curves Levins used: trade-off curves and fitness contours. However, fitness contours are not fixed but a function of the resident traits and we only consider those that divide the trait space into potentially successful mutants and mutants which are not able to invade ('invasion boundaries').

We compare an ecological nutrient-plant-herbivore food-chain model without evolution with the same model, including herbivore evolution, plant evolution, or both. When only herbivores are allowed to evolve, the predictions are similar to those of the ecological model without evolution, i.e., plant biomass does not change with nutrient addition. When only plants evolve, nutrient enrichment leads to an increase in the biomass of all compartments. In contrast, when plants and herbivores are allowed to coevolve, although these two classical patterns are common, a wide variety of other responses is possible. The form of the trade-offs that constrain evolution of the two protagonists is then critical.

	abstract = {In metapopulations, competitive interactions may extend beyond the confines of the local population such that members of neighbouring habitat patches affect each other adversely (quasi-local competition). We derive a model for quasi-local competition from first principles, assuming that individuals compete for shared resources and members of a population spend a certain fraction of their foraging time in the adjacent populations. Contrary to the results of Doebeli and Killingback [2003. Theor. Popul. Biol. 64, 397-416], our model does not produce spatial patterns of population densities in homogeneous environments. Quasi-local competition nevertheless contributes to pattern formation by amplifying the effect of heterogeneities in the external environment, and this amplification can be extremely strong when dispersal is absent. We discuss why apparently similar models lead to contrasting results. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

By specifying speciation, community size and dispersal, and completely ignoring differences among individual organisms and species, it generates biodiversity patterns that remarkably resemble natural ones. Here I show that adding even slight differences among organisms generates very different patterns and predictions. In large communities with widespread dispersal, heritable differences in viability among individual organisms lead to biodiversity patterns characterised by the overdominance of a single species comprising organisms with relatively high fitness. In communities with local dispersal, the same differences produce rapid community extinction.

Accurate approximate solutions for the cumulant functions are obtained using moment closure methods for two families of model parameterizations, one for badger and the other for fox population growth. For both model families, the equilibrium size distribution may be approximated well using the Normal approximation, and even more accurately using the saddlepoint approximation. It is shown that in comparison with the corresponding single birth model, the multiple birth mechanism increases the skewness and the variance of the equilibrium distribution, but slightly reduces its mean. Moreover, the type of density-dependent population control is shown to influence the sign of the skewness and the size of the variance. © 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Habitat structure has broad impacts on many biological systems. In particular, habitat fragmentation can increase the probability of species extinction and on the other hand it can lead to population outbreaks in response to a decline in natural enemies. An extreme consequence of fragmentation is the isolation of small regions of suitable habitat surrounded by a large region of hostile matrix. This scenario can be interpreted as a critical patch-size problem, well studied in a continuous time framework, but relatively new to discrete time models. In this paper we present an integrodifference host-parasitoid model, discrete in time and continuous in space, to study how the critical habitat-size necessary for parasitoid survival changes in response to parasitoid life history traits, such as emergence time. We show that early emerging parasitoids may be able to persist in smaller habitats than late emerging species. The model predicts that these early emerging parasitoids lead to more severe host outbreaks. We hypothesise that promoting efficient late emerging parasitoids may be key in reducing outbreak severity, an approach requiring large continuous regions of suitable habitat. We parameterise the model for the host species of the forest tent caterpillar Malacosoma disstria Hbn., a pest insect for which fragmented landscape increases the severity of outbreaks. This host is known to have several parasitoids, due to paucity of data and as a first step in the modelling we consider a single generic parasitoid. The model findings are related to observations of the forest tent caterpillar offering insight into this host-parasitoid response to habitat structure. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

In reality, growth of autotrophs and heterotrophs may be limited by various elements, e.g. carbon, nitrogen, phosphorous or iron. In this study we develop a dynamic energy budget model chemostat which has both carbon and nitrogen as currencies, and examine how the dual availibility of these elements affects the growth of phytoplankton, trophic transfer to zooplankton, and the resulting stability of the chemostat ecosystem. Both species have two reserve pools to obtain a larger metabolic flexibility with respect to changing external environments. Mineral nitrogen and carbon form the base of the food chain, and they are supplied at a constant rate. In addition, the biota in the chemostat recycle nutrients by means of respiration and excretion, and organic detritus is recycled at a fixed rate. We use numerical bifurcation analysis to assess the model's dynamic behavior. In the model, phytoplankton is nitrogen limited, and nitrogen enrichment can lead to oscillations and multiple stable states. Moreover, we found that recycling has a destabilizing effect on the food chain due to the increased repletion of mineral nutrients. We found that both carbon and nitrogen enrichment stimulate zooplankton growth. Therefore, we conclude that the concept of single-element limitation may not be applicable in an ecosystem context. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The frequency of individuals with a certain general predisposition, which is transmitted vertically, plays a role as the cultural background, or the cultural niche, of the population. The cultural background determines the rate of oblique, relative to vertical, transmission of another cultural trait that affects fertility of individuals. It is assumed that individuals with fewer offspring are more likely to achieve social roles that influence the succeeding generation and are therefore overrepresented as transmitters in the process of oblique transmission. Our model suggests that even a slight overrepresentation of those with fewer offspring can drive the evolution of small family size, provided that the rate of oblique transmission depends strongly on the cultural background. In addition, our model may help to explain the time lag between the decrease in death rates and the subsequent decrease in birth rates during the demographic transition of industrializing societies. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

We considered three patterns of development of host and parasitoid: (a) prolonged parasitoid diapause controlled by host physiology, (b) parasitoid interference in host development, preventing parasitized hosts from prolonging diapause, and (c) host diapause independent of parasitoid attack. We found that single-year prolonged diapause shifted the boundaries of the May model towards a slight increase in stability. Longer periods of diapause prolongation had a stronger influence, but this influence remained modest if we considered realistic parameter values. In contrast to other recent studies, our results suggest that prolonged diapause does not necessarily compensate for the destabilizing effects of time lags on the influence of parasitoids on population dynamics. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

We investigate the competition in a chaotic regime of evolution of the number of members of populations. We show that the nonconstant competition coefficients can lead to a regularisation of the time intervals of domination of each population and the non-constant growth rates can lead to decreasing length of the time intervals of domination as well as to chaotisation of the occurrence of these intervals. A quantity characterising the time intervals between the successive maxima of the number of the populations individuals is discussed.

We identify three mechanisms whereby limited dispersal of hosts and parasitoids combined with other features, such as spatial and temporal heterogeneity, can promote increased persistence and stability. The first mechanism, "statistical stabilization", is simply the statistical effect that summing a number of out-of-phase population trajectories results in a relatively constant total population density. The second mechanism involves decoupling of immigration from local density, such that limited dispersal between asynchronous patches results in an effect that mimics density-dependence at the local patch level. The third mechanism involves altering spatially averaged parameter values resulting from spatial heterogeneity in density combined with non-linear responses to density. Persistence in spatially explicit models with local dispersal is frequently associated with self-organized spatial patterning. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

For such situations, we present here a data generation method where an ancestral graph with non-overlapping generations is first generated backwards in time, using ideas from coalescent theory. Alleles are randomly assigned to the founders, and subsequently the gene flow over the entire genome is simulated forwards in time by dropping alleles down the graph according to recombination model without interference. The parameters controlling the mating behavior of generated individuals in the graph (degree of monogamy) can be tuned in order to match a particular demographic situation, without restriction to simple random mating.

An analytical model, incorporating a lottery-based recruitment and dispersal stochasticity, was built. The spatially mediated cost of the seed-shadow handicap has been assessed considering the criterions for the invasion of a resident hermaphrodite species by a dioecious species and the reverse invasion, both species having the same demographic parameters but assuming a likely higher fecundity for dioecious females. The reciprocal invasion of a dioecious and hermaphrodite species differing only by their fecundity is never possible. The seed-shadow handicap disappears when the dispersal or survival rate is high enough. This latter point is due to dispersal stochasticity, which allows for the existence of empty patches. A low fecundity and an aggregated seed distribution increase dispersal stochasticity and increase the positive impact of a low mortality rate on the relative competitivity of dioecy and hermaphroditism. Adding a dispersal cost has a comparable effect but also requires higher dispersal rates for the dioecious invasion. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Integer lattices are important theoretical landscapes for studying the consequences of dispersal and spatial population structure, but convenient dispersal kernels able to represent important features of dispersal in nature have been lacking for lattices. Because leptokurtic (centrally peaked and long-tailed) kernels are common in nature and have important effects in models, of particular interest are families of dispersal kernels in which the degree of leptokurtosis can be varied parametrically. Here we develop families of kernels on integer lattices with several important properties. The degree of leptokurtosis can be varied parametrically from near 0 (the Gaussian value) to infinity. These kernels are all asymptotically radially symmetric. (Exact radial symmetry is impossible on lattices except in one dimension.) They have separate parameters for shape and scale, and their lower order moments and Fourier transforms are given by simple formulae. In most cases, the kernel families that we develop are closed under convolution so that multiple steps of a kernel remain within the same family. Included in these families are kernels with asymptotic power function tails, which have provided good fits to some observations from nature.

	abstract = {Models of metapopulations have often ignored local community dynamics and spatial heterogeneity among patches. However, persistence of a community as a whole depends both on the local interactions and the rates of dispersal between patches. We study a mathematical model of a metacommunity with two consumers exploiting a resource in a habitat of two different patches. They are the exploitative competitors or the competing predators indirectly competing through depletion of the shared resource. We show that they can potentially coexist, even if one species is sufficiently inferior to be driven extinct in both patches in isolation, when these patches are connected through diffusive dispersal. Thus, dispersal can mediate coexistence of competitors, even if both patches are local sinks for one species because of the interactions with the other species. The spatial asynchrony and the competition-colonization trade-off are usual mechanisms to facilitate regional coexistence. However, in our case, two consumers can coexist either in synchronous oscillation between patches or in equilibrium. The higher dispersal rate of the superior prompts rather than suppresses the inferior. Since differences in the carrying capacity between two patches generate flows from the more productive patch to the less productive, loss of the superior by emigration relaxes competition in the former, and depletion of the resource by subsidized consumers decouples the local community in the latter. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {We look at a simple model in which an animal makes behavioural decisions over time in an environment in which all parameters are known to the animal except predation risk. In the model there is a trade-off between gaining information about predation risk and anti-predator behaviour. All predator attacks lead to death for the prey, so that the prey learns about predation risk by virtue of the fact that it is still alive. We show that it is not usually optimal to behave as if the current unbiased estimate of the predation risk is its true value. We consider two different ways to model reproduction; in the first scenario the animal reproduces throughout its life until it dies, and in the second scenario expected reproductive success depends on the level of energy reserves the animal has gained by some point in time. For both of these scenarios we find results on the form of the optimal strategy and give numerical examples which compare optimal behaviour with behaviour under simple rules of thumb. The numerical examples suggest that the value of the optimal strategy over the rules of thumb is greatest when there is little current information about predation risk, learning is not too costly in terms of predation, and it is energetically advantageous to learn about predation. We find that for the model and parameters investigated, a very simple rule of thumb such as 'use the best constant control' performs well. © 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

We analyzed how behaviors of toxic avoidance or attraction during the spawning migration alter the impact of pollution. Attraction behaviors basically enhanced the bad effect of pollution. More interesting, avoidance behaviors can weakly lift the asymptotic population growth rate, while if there is density-dependent effects on recruitment, pollutant avoidance can actually lead to a substantial drop in equilibrium size. Our model allowed comparing the relative significance of migratory and demographic disruptions for explaining the population impacts of pollution; we thus stress on the need of increasing efforts to develop knowledge relative to toxicant-induced spatial behaviors and to integrate such effects in the definition of environmental quality criteria. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

We demonstrate that the most appropriate measure of fragment value depends on the question asked. Specifically, we analyse four alternative measures: the contribution of a fragment to the metapopulation capacity of the network, to the equilibrium metapopulation size, to the expected time to metapopulation extinction and the long-term contribution of a fragment to colonization events in the network. The latter measure is comparable to density-dependent measures in general matrix population theory, though some differences are introduced by the fact that "density dependence" is spatially localized in the metapopulation context. We show that the value of a fragment depends not only on the properties of the landscape but also on the properties of the species. Most importantly, variation in fragment values between the habitat fragments is greatest in the case of rare species that occur close to the extinction threshold, as these species are likely to be restricted to the most favorable parts of the landscape. We expect that the measures of habitat fragment value described and analysed here have applications in landscape ecology and in conservation biology. © 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

We refer to such efforts as "microevolutionary genomics". We report the results of comparative analyses of complete intraspecific genome (and proteome) sequences from four bacterial species - Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Helicobacter pylori and Neisseria meningitidis. Comparisons of average synonymous (Ks) and nonsynonymous (Ka) substitution rates were used to assess the influence of various biological factors on the rate of protein evolution. For example, E. coli experiences the most intense purifying selection of the species analyzed, and this may be due to the relatively larger population size of this species. In addition, essential genes were shown to be more evolutionarily conserved than nonessential genes in E. coli and duplicated genes have higher rates of evolution than unique genes for all species studied except C. pneumoniae. Different functional categories of genes were shown to evolve at significantly different rates emphasizing the role of category-specific functional constraints in determining evolutionary rates. Finally, functionally characterized genes tend to be conserved between strains, while uncharacterized genes are over-represented among the unique, strain-specific genes. This suggests the possibility that nonessential genes are responsible for driving the evolutionary diversification between strains. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).},

	abstract = {Case-control studies are used to map loci associated with a genetic disease. The usual case-control study tests for significant differences in frequencies of alleles at marker loci. In this paper, we consider the problem of comparing two or more marker loci simultaneously and testing for significant differences in haplotype rather than allele frequencies. We consider two situations. In the first, genotypes at marker loci are resolved into haplotypes by making use of biochemical methods or by genotyping family members. In the second, genotypes at marker loci are not resolved into haplotypes, but, by assuming random mating, haplotypes can be inferred using a likelihood method such as the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. We assume that a causative locus has two alleles with a multiplicative effect on the penetrance of a disease, with one allele increasing the penetrance by a factor π. We find, for small values of π-1 and large sample sizes, asymptotic results that predict the statistical power of a test for significant differences in haplotype frequencies between cases and a random sample of the population, both when haplotypes can be resolved and when haplotypes have to be inferred. The increase in power when haplotypes can be resolved can be expressed as a ratio R, which is the increase in sample size needed to achieve the same power when haplotypes are resolved over when they are not resolved. In general, R depends on the pattern of linkage disequilibrium between the causative allele and the marker haplotypes but is independent of the frequency of the causative allele and, to a first approximation, is independent of π. For the special situation of two di-allelic marker loci, we obtain a simple expression for R and its upper bound. © 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

This coalescent-type process is related to the ancestral selection graph, and is derived from the ancestral influence graph by considering the limit as the recombination rate between loci gets large. We analyse the CSG both theoretically and via simulation. The main results are that the gene-interactions do not produce linkage disequilibrium, but do produce dependencies in allele frequencies between loci. For small selection rates, the distributions of the genealogy and the allele frequencies at a single locus are well-approximated by their distributions under a single locus model, where the fitness of each allele is the average of the true fitnesses of that allele with respect to the distribution of alleles at other loci. © 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

	abstract = {We consider establishment success (and extinction risk of small populations) in fluctuating environments, by means of an inhomogeneous branching process model. In this model it is assumed that individuals reproduce asexually during discrete reproduction periods. Within each period individuals reproduce independently and have random numbers of offspring. Expected numbers of offspring vary over reproduction periods due to random environmental changes. Previous simulation results indicated that there is a positive autocorrelation between the establishment probabilities of invaders in successive reproduction periods when environmental states are independently distributed. This result was never formally proved. In this paper we prove that this is indeed true, regardless of the form of the distribution of environmental states or the offspring distribution (under a monotonicity condition, which holds for biologically realistic models). Furthermore, we prove that it is also true for positively autocorrelated environmental states. We show by a counterexample that in environments with a strong negative autocorrelation establishment probabilities can be negatively autocorrelated. This was further examined through simulations. Our results imply that in independent, positively autocorrelated and weakly negatively autocorrelated environments the probability of success of invasion in different independently varying sites is the highest, followed by sequential invasion. For environments with a strong negative autocorrelation, sequential invasion has the highest probability of success. Effects of autocorrelation were further examined with simulations. From the results it appears that the expected length of 'runs of bad luck' is the most crucial factor for establishment success. © 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we reanalyze simple models of the evolution of dispersal in a heterogeneous landscape. Previous analyses concluded that without temporal variability, dispersal can evolve only if it is not costly and if it is conditional on the habitat. If both conditions hold, these models predict that selection on dispersal should lead to balanced dispersal between habitats (the number of immigrants equals the number of emigrants in each habitat). To evaluate the generality of these conclusions, we extended the analysis of these models to finite populations. This requires us to establish fitness measures for finite class-structured populations. These fitness measures allow us to take kin competition into account. Our analysis shows that even without temporal variability, conditional dispersal and the absence of a dispersal cost are not necessary conditions for dispersal to evolve. In the absence of a dispersal cost, we predict that selection on conditional dispersal will always lead to panmixia and not simply to balanced dispersal. When dispersal is costly, we show that the ideal free distribution (IFD) and balanced dispersal do not occur. Our results show that the deviations from IFD are of the order of the dispersal cost. We propose an approach to test our predictions. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).},

	abstract = {The theory of pleiotropic mutation and selection is investigated and developed for a large population of asexual organisms. Members of the population are subject to stabilising selection on Ω phenotypic characters, which each independently affect fitness. Pleiotropy is incorporated into the model by allowing each mutation to simultaneously affect all characters. To expose differences with continuous-allele models, the characters are taken to originate from discrete-effect alleles and thus have discrete genotypic effects. Each character can take the values nxΔ where n=0,±1,±2,..., and the splitting in character effects, Δ, is a parameter of the model. When the distribution of mutant effects is normally distributed around the parental value, and Δ is large, a "stepwise" model of mutation arises, where only adjacent trait effects are accessible from a single mutation. The present work is primarily concerned with the opposite limit, where Δ is small and many different trait effects are accessible from a single mutation. In contrast to what has been established for continuous-effect models, discrete-effect models do not yield a singular equilibrium distribution of genotypic effects for any value of Ω. Instead, for different values of Ω, the equilibrium frequencies of trait values have very different dependencies on Δ. For Ω=1 and 2, decreasing Δ broadens the width of the frequency distribution and hence increases the equilibrium level of polymorphism. For all sufficiently large values of Ω, however, decreasing Δ decreases the width of the frequency distribution and the equilibrium level of polymorphism. The connection with continuous trait models follows when the limit Δ→0 is considered, and a singular probability density of trait values is obtained for all sufficiently large Ω. © 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

	abstract = {Stepping-stone models for the ecological dynamics of metapopulations are often used to address general questions about the effects of spatial structure on the nature and complexity of population fluctuations. Such models describe an ensemble of local and spatially isolated habitat patches that are connected through dispersal. Reproduction and hence the dynamics in a given local population depend on the density of that local population, and a fraction of every local population disperses to neighboring patches. In such models, interesting dynamic phenomena, e.g. the persistence of locally unstable predator-prey interactions, are only observed if the local dynamics in an isolated patch exhibit non-equilibrium behavior. Therefore, the scope of these models is limited. Here we extend these models by making the biologically plausible assumption that reproductive success in a given local habitat not only depends on the density of the local population living in that habitat, but also on the densities of neighboring local populations. This would occur if competition for resources occurs between neighboring populations, e.g. due to foraging in neighboring habitats. With this assumption of quasi-local competition the dynamics of the model change completely. The main difference is that even if the dynamics of the local populations have a stable equilibrium in isolation, the spatially uniform equilibrium in which all local populations are at their carrying capacity becomes unstable if the strength of quasi-local competition reaches a critical level, which can be calculated analytically. In this case the metapopulation reaches a new stable state, which is, however, not spatially uniform anymore and instead results in an irregular spatial pattern of local population abundance. For large metapopulations, a huge number of different, spatially non-uniform equilibrium states coexist as attractors of the metapopulation dynamics, so that the final state of the system depends critically on the initial conditions. The existence of a large number of attractors has important consequences when environmental noise is introduced into the model. Then the metapopulation performs a random walk in the space of all attractors. This leads to large and complicated population fluctuations whose power spectrum obeys a red-shifted power law. Our theory reiterates the potential importance of spatial structure for ecological processes and proposes new mechanisms for the emergence of non-uniform spatial patterns of abundance and for the persistence of complicated temporal population fluctuations. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

Recent findings indicate that chromosomal distribution of Alu retroelements deposited in the past is different from the distribution of Alu elements that continue to be inserted in human population. These active elements from AluY sub(sub)families are the major focus of this paper. In particular, we analyzed chromosomal proportions of 19 AluY subfamilies, of which nine are reported for the first time in this paper. These 19 subfamilies contain over 80% of Alu elements that are polymorphic in the human genome. The chromosomal density of these most recent Alu insertions is around three times higher on chromosome Y than on chromosome X and over two times higher than the average density for all human autosomes. Based on this observation and other data we propose that active Alu elements are passed through paternal germlines. There is also some evidence that a small fraction of active Alu elements from less abundant subfamilies can be retroposed in female germlines or in the early embryos. Finally, we propose that the origin of Alu subfamilies in human populations may be related to evolution of chromosome Y. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).},

	abstract = {The paper describes a mutational equilibrium model of genome size evolution. This model is different from both adaptive and junk DNA models of genome size evolution in that it does not assume that genome size is maintained either by positive or stabilizing selection for the optimum genome size (as in adaptive theories) or by purifying selection against too much junk DNA (as in junk DNA theories). Instead the genome size is suggested to evolve until the loss of DNA through more frequent small deletions is equal to the rate of DNA gain through more frequent long insertions. The empirical basis for this theory is the finding of a strong correlation and of a clear power-function relationship between the rate of mutational DNA loss (per bp) through small deletions and genome size in animals. Genome size scales as a negative 1.3 power function of the deletion rate per nucleotide. Such a relationship is not predicted by either adaptive or junk DNA theories. However, if genome size is maintained at equilibrium by the balance of mutational forces, this empirilical relationship can be readily accommodated. Within this framework, this finding would imply that the rate of DNA gain through large insertions scales up a quarter-power function of genome size. On this view, as genome size grows, the rate of growth through large insertions is increasing as a quarter power function of genome size and the rate of DNA loss through small deletions increases linearly, until eventually, at the stable equilibrium genome size value, rates of growth and loss equal each other. The current data also suggest that the long-term variation is genome size in animals is brought about to a significant extent by changes in the intrinsic rates of DNA loss through small deletions. Both the origin of mutational biases and the adaptive consequences of such a mode of evolution of genome size are discussed. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).},

This principle does not appear to hold in nature, where high biodiversity is commonly observed, even in seemingly homogenous habitats. Although various mechanisms, such as spatial heterogeneity or chaotic fluctuations, have been proposed to explain this coexistence, none of them invalidates this principle. Here we evaluate whether principles of ecological stoichiometry can contribute to the stable maintenance of biodiverse communities. Stoichiometric analysis recognizes that each organism is a mixture of multiple chemical elements such as carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) that are present in various proportions in organisms. We incorporate these principles into a standard predator-prey model to analyze competition between two predators on one autotrophic prey. The model tracks two essential elements, C and P, in each species. We show that a stable equilibrium is possible with two predators on this single prey. At this equilibrium both predators can be limited by the P content of the prey. The analysis suggests that chemical heterogeneity within and among species provides new mechanisms that can support species coexistence and that may be important in maintaining biodiversity. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {Polyploids can be classified as either allopolyploids or autopolyploids based on their presumed origins. From a perspective of linkage analysis, however, the nature of polyploids can be better described as bivalent polyploids, in which two chromosomes pair at meiosis, multivalent polyploids, in which more than two chromosomes pair, and general polyploids, in which bivalent and multivalent formations occur simultaneously. In this paper, we develop a statistical method for linkage analysis of polymorphic markers in bivalent polyploids. This method takes into account a unique cytological pairing mechanism for the formation of diploid gametes in tetraploids - preferential bivalent pairings at meiosis during which two homologous chromosomes pair with a higher probability than two homoeologous chromosomes. The higher frequency of homologous over homoeologous pairing, defined as the preferential pairing factor, affects the segregation patterns and linkage analysis of different genes on the same chromosome. A maximum likelihood method implemented with the EM algorithm is proposed to simultaneously estimate linkage and parental linkage phases over a pair of markers from any possible marker cross type between two outbred bivalent tetraploid parents demonstrating preferential bivalent pairings. Simulation studies display that the method can be well used to estimate the recombination fraction between different marker types and the preferential pairing factor typical of bivalent tetraploids. The implications of this method for current genome projects in polyploid species are discussed. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).},

Such heterogeneity may be, for example, spatial, temporal or behavioral in form. Generally, models that include population subdivision have assumed that individuals are permanently assigned to given behavioral states represented by the subpopulations. We consider a simple epidemic model in which a behavioral trait affects disease transmission, and this trait may be transferred among hosts as a consequence of social interaction. This creates a situation where the frequencies of different behavioral traits and disease states as well as their associations may change over time. We consider the impact of the culturally transmitted trait on the criterion for initial spread of the disease. We also explore the evolution of cultural traits in response to pathogen dynamics and show some conditions under which behavioral traits that reduce transmission evolve. We find that behaviors increasing the risk of infection can also evolve when they are inherently favored or when there is sufficient clustering of contacts between like behaviors. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).},

It is also becoming evident that only a small percent of the eukaryotic genome codes for molecules involved in cellular structures and functions, and that much of the remainder may have a viral origin. Viruses clearly play a central role in the biosphere, but how is this viral world organized? Classification was originally based on virus morphology and the particular host infected, but now there is an increasing trend to rely on sequence information. The type of genome (e.g., RNA or DNA, single- or double-stranded) provides fundamental classification criteria, while sequence comparisons can provide fine mapping for closely related viruses. However, it is currently very difficult to identify long-range evolutionary relationships. We present here a different approach, based on the idea that each virus has an innate "self." When the structures and functions characteristic of this "self" are identified, then they uncover relationships beyond those accessible from sequence information alone. The new approach is illustrated by sketching some possible viral lineages. We propose that urviruses were present before the division of cellular life into its current domains, and that the viral world has lineages that can be traced back to the root of the universal tree of life. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).},

We find that 16 different equilibrium patterns exist, having up to 11 equilibria; up to seven interior equilibria may coexist, and up to four interior equilibria, three in negative and one in positive linkage disequilibrium, may be simultaneously stable. Also, two monomorphic and two fully polymorphic equilibria may be simultaneously stable. Therefore, the result of evolution may be highly sensitive to perturbations in the initial conditions or in the underlying genetic parameters. For the special case of equal effects, global stability results are proved. In the general case, we rely in part on numerical computations. The results are compared with previous analyses of the special case of extremely strong selection, of an approximate model that assumes linkage equilibrium, and of the much simpler quadratic optimum model. © 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

	abstract = {Species living in highly fragmented landscapes typically occur as metapopulations with frequent turnover of local populations. The turnover rate depends on population sizes and connectivities, but it may also depend on the phenotypic and genotypic composition of populations. The Glanville fritillary butterfly (Melitaea cinxia) in Finland uses two host plant species, which show variation in their relative abundances at two spatial scales: locally among individual habitat patches and regionally among networks of patches. Female butterflies in turn exhibit spatial variation in genetically determined host plant preference within and among patch networks. Emigration, immigration and establishment of new populations have all been shown to be strongly influenced by the match between the host plant composition of otherwise suitable habitat patches and the host plant preference of migrating butterflies. The evolutionary consequences of such biased migration and colonization with respect to butterfly phenotypes might differ depending on spatial configuration and plant species composition of the patches in heterogeneous patch networks. Using a spatially realistic individual-based model we show that the model-predicted evolution of host plant preference due to biased migration explains a significant amount of the observed variation in host plant use among metapopulations living in dissimilar networks. This example illustrates how the ecological extinction-colonization dynamics may be linked with the evolutionary dynamics of life history traits in metapopulations. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {To understand bacterial phylogeny, it is essential that the following two critical issues be resolved: (i) development of well-defined (molecular) criteria for identifying the main groups within Bacteria, and (ii) to understand how the different main groups are related to each other and how they branched off from a common ancestor. These issues are not resolved at present. We have recently described a new approach, based on shared conserved inserts and deletions (indels or signature sequences) found in various proteins, that provides a reliable means for understanding these issues. A large number of conserved indels that are shared by different groups of bacteria have been identified. Using these indels, and based simply on their presence or absence, all of the main groups within Bacteria can be defined in clear molecular terms and new species could be assigned to them with minimal ambiguity. The analysis of these indels also permits one to logically deduce that the various main bacterial groups have branched off from a common ancestor in the following order: Low G+C Gram-positive ⇒ High G+C Gram-positive ⇒ Clostridium-Fusobacteria-Thermotoga ⇒ Deinococcus-Thermus-Green nonsulfur bacteria ⇒ Cyanobacteria ⇒ Spirochetes ⇒ Chlamydia-Cytophaga- Bacteroides-Green sulfur bacteria ⇒ Aquifex ⇒ Proteobacteria 1 (ε and δ) ⇒ Proteobacteria-2. (α) ⇒ Proteobacteria-3 (β) and ⇒ Proteobacteria-4 (γ). The validity of this approach was tested using sequence data from bacterial genomes. By making use of 18 conserved indels, species from all 60 completed bacterial genomes were assigned to different groups. The observed distribution of these indels in different species was then compared with that predicted by the model. Of the 936 observations concerning the placement of these indels in various species, all except one were in accordance with the model. The placement of bacteria into different groups using this approach also showed excellent correlation with the 16S rRNA phylogenies with nearly all of the species assigned to the same groups by both methods. These results provide strong evidence that the genes containing these indels have not been affected by factors such as lateral gene transfers. However, such events are readily detected by this means and some examples are provided. The approach described here thus provides a reliable and internally consistent means for understanding various critical and long outstanding issues in bacterial phylogeny. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).},

Because we model the cannibalistic interaction as dependent on the ratio of cannibal length and victim length, a cannibal experiences a size distribution of potential victims which depends on its own body size. We show how equilibria of the resulting infinite-dimensional dynamical system can be traced with an existing method for numerical continuation for physiologically structured population models. With this approach we found that cannibalism can induce bistability associated with a fold (or, saddle-node) bifurcation. The two stable states can be qualified as 'stunted' and 'piscivorous', respectively. We identify a new ecological mechanism for bistability, in which the energy gain from cannibalism plays a crucial role: Whereas in the stunted population state cannibals consume their victims, on average, while they are very small and yield little energy, in the piscivorous state cannibals consume their victims not before they have become much bigger, which results in a much higher mean yield of cannibalism. We refer to this mechanism as the 'Hansel and Gretel' effect. It is not related to any individual 'choice' or 'strategy', but depends purely on a difference in population size distribution. We argue that studying dynamics of size-structured population models with this new approach of equilibrium continuation extends the insight that can be gleaned from numerical simulations of the model dynamics. © 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

	abstract = {The densities of populations in a community or food web vary as a consequence of both population interactions and environmental (e.g. weather) fluctuations. Populations often respond to the same kinds of environmental fluctuations, and therefore experience correlated environments. Furthermore, some environmental factors change slowly over time, thereby producing positive environmental autocorrelation. We show that the effects of environmental correlation and autocorrelation on the dynamics of the populations in a food web can be large and unintuitive, but can be understood by analyzing the eigenvectors of the community (system) matrix of interactions among populations. For example, environmental correlation and autocorrelation may either obscure or enhance the cyclic dynamics that generally characterize predator-prey interactions even when there is no direct effect of the environment on how species interact. Thus, understanding the population dynamics of species in a food web requires explicit attention to the correlation structure of environmental factors affecting all species. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {Temporal fluctuations in recruitment are involved in two distinct coexistence mechanisms, the storage effect and relative nonlinearity of competition, which may act simultaneously to stabilize species coexistence. It is shown that comparisons of recruitment variation between species at high versus low densities can test whether these mechanisms are responsible for stable coexistence. Moreover, under certain circumstances, these comparisons can measure the total coexistence stabilizing effect of the mechanism. These comparisons are clearest for the situation of an invader (a species perturbed to low density) in the presence of its competitors, termed residents. Then average invader-resident differences in the variances of log recruitment, potentially weighted by adult survival rates and species' sensitivities to competition, are proportional to the overall stabilizing effect of the storage effect and relative nonlinearity of competition. Less effective comparisons are available for species naturally at high and low densities or with substantial mean differences in average fitness. These developments lead also to a technique of partitioning the long-term low-density growth rate of a species into community average measures of stabilizing mechanisms, deviations from these measures, and other factors. The community average measure is argued as most appropriate for understanding the ability of a coexistence mechanism to stabilize coexistence. Individual species' deviations from the community average indicate the ways in a which a coexistence mechanism may affect average fitness differences between species either enhancing or diminishing the ability of a given set of species to coexist, depending on other factors. This approach provides a general new tool for analyzing species coexistence. © 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The variance of an IBD tract is large: a model described by (Genet. Res. Cambridge 35 (1980) 131) underestimates this variance. Using Fisher's concept of junctions, we predict the mean length of an IBD tract, given the age of the population and the population sizes over time. We derive results also for subdivided populations, given times of subdivision events and sizes of the resulting subpopulations. The model demonstrates that population growth and subdivision strongly affect the expected length of an IBD tract in small populations.

Stochastic simulations, using parameter values based on some case studies, preserve many features of the deterministic model, like the average value of the variables and the approximate length of the cycles. An important difference is that, even when deterministic models yield damped oscillations, stochastic simulations yield apparently sustained oscillations. The amplitude of such oscillations may be so large to threaten parasites' persistence. With density-dependence in parasite demographic traits, persistence increases somewhat. Allowing instead for infections from an external parasite reservoir, we found that host extinction may easily occur. However, the extinction probability is almost independent of the level of external infection over a wide intermediate parameter region. © 2003 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.},

This model and existing models which include prey depletion, predict partial-preference and a generic diet preference for the commonest prey types (apostatic selection). Unlike previous diet selection models, it is found that the optimal diet selection of an individual predator can be to favour the rarest prey type (anti-apostatic selection) when encounter rates are high, even if the individual prey do not differ in their nutritional value. Studies have demonstrated that predators generally show apostatic selection, even when all prey have the same nutritional value. Anti-apostatic selection has also been observed when prey are crowded, and therefore at high density, consistent with the idea of high encounter rates. This anti-apostatic diet selection has previously been proposed as evidence for the use of prey search images by a predator, or variation in individual prey preference. In this paper it is suggested that prey renewal is a further factor, often confounded in experiments, which could favour anti-apostatic selection. © 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

This article explores a conjecture, motivated by empirical findings, that the expression of recessive deleterious factors at sites closely linked to the S-locus may cause greater declines in the viability of zygotes constituted from more closely related S-alleles. Diffusion approximation models incorporating variation in viability among S-locus genotypes and antagonistic interactions between a new specificity and its immediate parent specificity are constructed and analyzed. Results indicate that variation in viability tends to reduce the number of specificities maintained in a population at stochastic steady state, and that genealogy-based antagonism reduces the rate of bifurcation of S-allele lineages. These effects may account for some of the unusual features observed in empirical studies of S-allele genealogies. © 2003 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.},

Properties of this measure are stated for canonical cases. The measure is then used to evaluate which subsets of a particular set of n signals are more or less coherent. This set of signals comprises extrinsic, stochastic resource inputs and the population trajectories obtained from simulations of a discrete time model of competing biological populations driven by these resource inputs. The analysis reveals that, at low levels of competition, the correlative coherence of the combined system of intrinsic population and extrinsic resource variables is relatively low, but increases with increasing variation in the resources. Further, at intermediate and high competition levels, the correlative coherence depends more strongly on competition than entrainment of stochasticity in the extrinsic resource variables. Density dependence has the effect of amplifying variation in noise only when this variation is relatively large. Also, chaotic systems appear to be entrained by sufficiently noisy environmental inputs. © 2003 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.},

The pair-edge approximation is a moment-closure method that is effective in predicting persistence criteria and invasion speeds on a homogeneous lattice. Here we evaluate the effectiveness of the pair-edge approximation on a spatially heterogeneous lattice in which some sites are unoccupiable, or "dead". This model has several possible interpretations, including a spatial SIS epidemic model, in which some sites are occupied by immobile host-species individuals while others are empty. We find that, as in the homogeneous model, the pair-edge approximation is significantly more accurate than the ordinary pair approximation in determining conditions for persistence. However, habitat heterogeneity decreases invasion speed more than is predicted by the pair-edge approximation, and the discrepancy increases with greater clustering of "dead" sites. The accuracy of the approximation validates the underlying heuristic picture of population spread and therefore provides qualitative insight into the dynamics of lattice models. Conversely, the situations where the approximation is less accurate reveals limitations of pair approximation in the presence of spatial heterogeneity. © 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Here, we address this problem for a class of site-based ecological models, where local interactions between individuals take place at a finite number of discrete resource sites over non-overlapping generations and, between generations, individuals move randomly between sites over the entire system. Such site-based models have previously been applied to a wide range of ecological systems: from those involving contest or scramble competition for resources to host-parasite interactions and meta-populations. We show how the population dynamics of site-based models can be accurately approximated by and understood through deterministic and stochastic difference equations. Conversely, we use the inverse of this approximation to show what implicit assumptions are made about individual interactions by modelling of population dynamics in terms of difference equations. To this end, we prove a useful and general theorem: that any model in our class of site-based models has a corresponding stochastic difference equation population model, by which it can be approximated. This theorem allows us to calculate long-term population dynamics, evolutionary stable strategies and, by extending our theory to account for large deviations, extinction probabilities for a wide range of site-based systems. Our methodology is then illustrated to various examples of between species competition, predator-prey interactions and co-operation. © 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Ecological communities are typically open to the immigration and emigration of individuals, and also variable through time. In this paper we argue that interesting and potentially important effects arise when one splices together spatial fluxes and temporal variability. The particular system we examine is a sink habitat, where a species faces deterministic extinction but is rescued by recurrent immigration. We have shown, using a simple extension of the canonical exponential growth model in a time-varying environment, that variation "inflates" the average abundance of sink populations. We can analytically quantify the magnitude of this effect in several special cases (square-wave temporal variation and Gaussian stochastic variation). The inflationary effect can be large in "intermittent" sinks (where there are periods with positive growth), and when temporal variation is strongly autocorrelated. The effect appears to be robust to incorporation of demographic stochasticity (due to discrete birth-death-immigration processes), and to direct density dependence. With discrete generations, however, one can observe a wide range of effects of temporal variation, including depression as well as inflation. We argue that the inflationary effect of temporal variation in sink habitats can have important implications for community structure, because it can increase the average abundance (and hence local impacts) of species that on average are being excluded from a local community. We illustrate the latter effect using a familiar model of exploitative competition for a single limiting resource. We demonstrate that temporal variation can reverse local competitive dominance, even to the extent of allowing an inferior competitor maintained by immigration to exclude a competing species that would be locally superior in a constant environment. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

First, homologous recombination mediates the exchange of DNA between closely related individuals (those whose sequences are sufficient similarly to allow efficient integration). As a result, homologous recombination mediates the dispersal of advantageous alleles that may rise to high frequency among genetically related individuals via periodic selection events. Second, lateral gene transfer can introduce novel DNA into a genome from completely unrelated lineages via illegitimate recombination. Gene exchange by this route serves to distribute genes throughout distantly related clades and therefore may confer complex abilities - not otherwise found among closely related lineages - onto the recipient organisms. These two mechanisms of gene exchange play complementary roles in the diversification of microbial populations into independent, ecologically distinct lineages.

In a population of constant size, and with no selection, the probability of survival of some part of a stretch of map length y<1 approaches y/log(yt/2) for log(yt)≫1. Thus, the whole genome is certain to be lost, but the rate of loss is extremely slow. This solution extends to give the whole distribution of surviving block sizes as a function of time. We show that the expected number of blocks at time t is 1+yt and give expressions for the moments of the number of blocks and the total amount of genome that survives for a given time. The solution is based on a branching process and assumes complete interference between crossovers, so that each descendant carries only a single block of ancestral material. We consider cases where most individuals carry multiple blocks, either because there are multiple crossovers in a long genetic map, or because enough time has passed that most individuals in the population are related to each other. For species such as ours, which have a long genetic map, the genome of any individual which leaves descendants (~80% of the population for a Poisson offspring number with mean two) is likely to persist for an extremely long time, in the form of a few short blocks of genome. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

These measures are derived from moments of probability distributions related to mortality and fecundity schedules. Like moments, these measures form infinite sequences, but the first terms of these sequences are of particular value in approximating the long-term growth rate of an age- structured population that is growing slowly. Higher order terms are needed for approximating faster growing populations. These approximations offer a general nonparametric approach to the study of life-history evolution in both constant and variable environments. These techniques provide simple quantitative representations of the classical findings that, with fixed expected lifetime and net reproductive rate, type I mortality and early peak reproduction increase the absolute magnitude of the population growth rate, while type III mortality and delayed peak reproduction reduce this absolute magnitude. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {Two or more competing predators can coexist using a single homogeneous prey species if the system containing all three undergoes internally generated fluctuations in density. However, the dynamics of species that coexist via this mechanism have not been extensively explored. Here, we examine both the nature of the dynamics and the responses of the mean densities of each predator to mortality imposed upon it or its competitor. The analysis of dynamics uncovers several previously undescribed behaviors for this model, including chaotic fluctuations, and long-term transients that differ significantly from the ultimate patterns of fluctuations. The limiting dynamics of the system can be loosely classified as synchronous cycles, asynchronous cycles, and chaotic dynamics. Synchronous cycles are simple limit cycles with highly positively correlated densities of the two predator species. Asynchronous cycles are limit cycles, frequently of complex form, including a significant period during which prey density is nearly constant while one predator gradually, monotonically replaces the other. Chaotic dynamics are aperiodic and generally have intermediate correlations between predator densities. Continuous changes in density-independent mortality rates often lead to abrupt transitions in mean population sizes, and increases in the mortality rate of one predator may decrease the population size of the competing predator. Similarly, increases in the immigration rate of one predator may decrease its own density and increase the density of the other predator. Proportional changes in one predator's birth and death rate functions can have significant effects on the dynamics and mean densities of both predator species. All of these responses to environmental change differ from those observed when competitors coexist stably as the result of resource (prey) partitioning. The patterns described here occur in many other competition models in which there are cycles and differences in the linearity of the responses of consumers to their resources. © 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

An additional process that can facilitate persistence is the existence of habitat selection by dispersers. Using analytic and simulation models of population change, I found that when habitat patches exhibiting Allee effects are connected by dispersing individuals, habitat selection by these dispersers increases the likelihood that patches persist at high densities, relative to results expected by random settlement. Populations exhibiting habitat selection also attain equilibrium more quickly than randomly dispersing populations. These effects are particularly important when Allee effects are large and more than two patches exist. Integrating habitat selection into population dynamics may help address why some studies have failed to find extinction thresholds in populations, despite well-known Allee effects in many species. © 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

	abstract = {The lottery model of competition between species in a variable environmental has been influential in understanding how coexistence may result from interactions between fluctuating environmental and competitive factors. Of most importance, it has led to the concept of the storage effect as a mechanism of species coexistence. Interactions between environment and competition in the lottery model stem from the life-history assumption that environmental variation and competition affect recruitment to the adult population, but not adult survival. The strong role of life-history attributes in this coexistence mechanism implies that its robustness should be checked for a variety of life-history scenarios. Here, age structure is added to the adult population, and the results are compared with the original lottery model. This investigation uses recently developed shape characteristics for mortality and fecundity schedules to quantify the effects of age structure on the long-term low-density growth rate of a species in competition with its competitor when applying the standard invasibility coexistence criterion. Coexistence conditions are found to be affected to a small degree by the presence of age structure in the adult population: Type III mortality broadens coexistence conditions, and type I mortality makes them narrower. The rates of recovery from low density for coexisting species, and the rates of competitive exclusion in other cases, are modified to a greater degree by age structure. The absolute rates of recovery or decline of a species from low density are increased by type I mortality or early peak reproduction, but reduced by type III mortality or late peak reproduction. Analytical approximations show how the most important effects can be considered as simple modifications of the long-term low-density growth rates for the original lottery model. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

To model the inherent stochasticity during the growth phase in these populations, we assume a Poisson distribution of offspring. An analytical solution is developed to calculate the fixation probability and a computer simulation is used to verify the results. We find that the fixation rate of a favourable mutant is significantly lower when genetic drift is considered; fixation probability is reduced by over 25% for realistic experimental protocols. Our method is valid for both weak and strong selection; since very large selection coefficients have been reported in the experimental literature, this is an important improvement over previous results. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

The equations partition the effects of heterogeneity into an effect of local crowding and an effect of habitat association caused by differential mortality. Exogenous heterogeneity in mortality rate increases population viability through habitat association and decreases it through increased crowding; the net effect of exogenous heterogeneity is generally to improve population viability.

The model is analyzed for two initial conditions: the initial population density is concentrated on a straight line or at the origin. For each case, we derive a mathematical formula which characterizes the spatio-temporal pattern of range expansion. When initial distribution starts from a straight line, it evolves to a traveling periodic wave (TPW), whose frontal speed is analytically determinable. When the range starts from the origin, it tends to expand radially at a constant average speed in each direction (ray speed) keeping its frontal envelope in a similar shape. By examining the relation between the ray speed and the TPW speed, we derive the ray speed in a parametric form, from which the envelope of the expanding range can be predicted. Thus we analyze how the pattern and speed of the range expansion are affected by the pattern and scale of fragmentation, and the qualities of favorable and unfavorable habitats. The major results include: (1) The envelope of the expanding range show a variety of patterns, nearly circular, oval-like, spindle-like, depending on parameter values; (2) All these patterns are elongated in the direction of stripes; (3) When the scale of fragmentation is enlarged without changing the relative spatial pattern, the ray speed in any direction increases, i.e., the rate of range expansion increases. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we revisit quasicyclic dynamics from the perspective of nonlinear time series analysis. Time series are generated with a predator-prey model whose prey's growth rate is driven by environmental noise. A method for the analysis of short and noisy data provides evidence for sensitivity to initial conditions, with a global Lyapunov exponent often close to zero characteristic of populations 'at the edge of chaos'. Results with methods restricted to long time series are consistent with a finite-dimensional attractor on which dynamics are sensitive to initial conditions. These results are compared with those previously obtained for quasicycles in an individual-based model with heterogeneous spatial distributions. Patterns of sensitivity to initial conditions are shown to differentiate phase-forgetting from phase-remembering quasicycles involving a periodic driver. The previously reported mode at zero of Lyapunov exponents in field and laboratory populations may reflect, in part, quasicyclic dynamics. © 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The problem of moving from one coadapted gene complex to a better one can be divided into two steps: first the advantageous combination has to appear and then it has to take over the population. Selection can have contrasting effects on the two stages. When selection is weak intermediate forms are frequent, and the advantageous combination appears easily. Spreading of that advantageous combination, on the other hand, tends to be hard, as recombination acts to break it. The opposite is true when selection is strong. Spreading is easier, but if selection is also strong against the intermediate forms, the appearance of the beneficial combination becomes an extremely rare event. This inherent contrast in the optimal conditions for the two stages raises the possibility that proximity of areas differing in the intensity of selection may significantly shorten the expected waiting time for a peak shift. We studied this phenomenon in a haploid two-locus diallelic model of two neighboring subpopulations. Our results show that limited migration between the two areas might shorten the waiting time for a peak shift by orders of magnitude in comparison with either complete isolation or complete mixing. Implications for peripheral evolution and speciation are discussed. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.},

Both the male trait and the female preference are transmitted only between same-sex individuals, so that non-random association between the trait and the preference, which would give rise to a Fisherian runaway process, cannot arise. Inclusion of an autosomal gene that confers a female predisposition to acquire a certain preference is shown to allow the coevolution of the male trait and the female preference by a Fisherian process. This holds true even when the female preference has a slight viability cost, provided the male cultural transmission is not perfect. It is also suggested that a Fisherian process can be more easily initiated in these models than in the conventional genetic models. Furthermore, a Fisherian process may cause cultural transmission of female preference to evolve. Additionally, polymorphism can be maintained at the predisposition locus if heterozygous females have a stronger predisposition to acquire the preference than homozygotes. Our models may be applicable to the case when the male trait is a Y-linked genetic or environmentally determined trait. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In this paper we investigate the consequences of size-dependent competition among the individuals of a consumer population by analyzing the dynamic properties of a physiologically structured population model. Only 2 size-classes of individuals are distinguished: juveniles and adults. Juveniles and adults both feed on one and the same resource and hence interact by means of exploitative competition. Juvenile individuals allocate all assimilated energy into development and mature on reaching a fixed developmental threshold. The combination of this fixed threshold and the resource-dependent developmental rate, implies that the juvenile delay between birth and the onset of reproduction may vary in time. Adult individuals allocate all assimilated energy to reproduction. Mortality of both juveniles and adults is assumed to be inversely proportional to the amount of energy assimilated. In this setting we study how the dynamics of the population are influenced by the relative foraging capabilities of juveniles and adults. In line with results that we previously obtained in size-structured consumer-resource models with pulsed reproduction, population cycles primarily occur when either juveniles or adults have a distinct competitive advantage. When adults have a larger per capita feeding rate and are hence competitively superior to juveniles, population oscillations occur that are primarily induced by the fact that the duration of the juvenile period changes with changing food conditions. These cycles do not occur when the juvenile delay is a fixed parameter. When juveniles are competitively superior, two different types of population fluctuations can occur: (1) rapid, low-amplitude fluctuations having a period of half the juvenile delay and (2) slow, large-amplitude fluctuations characterized by a period, which is roughly equal to the juvenile delay. The analysis of simplified versions of the structured model indicates that these two types of oscillations also occur if mortality and/or development is independent of food density, i.e. in a situation with a constant juvenile developmental delay and a constant, food-independent background mortality. Thus, the oscillations that occur when juveniles are more competitive are induced by the juvenile delay per se. When juveniles exert a larger foraging pressure on the shared resource, maturation implies an increase not only in adult density, but also in food density and consequently fecundity. Our analysis suggests that this correlation in time between adult density and fecundity is crucial for the occurrence of population cycles when juveniles are competitively superior. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

The defining property of the environmental condition is that individuals are independent of one another (and hence equations are linear) when this condition is prescribed (in principle as an arbitrary function of time, but when focussing on steady states we shall restrict to constant functions). The steady-state problem has two components: (i) the environmental condition should be such that the existing populations do neither grow nor decline; (ii) a feedback consistency condition relating the environmental condition to the community/population size and composition should hold. In this paper we develop, justify and analyse basic formalism under the assumption that individuals can be born in only finitely many possible states and that the environmental condition is fully characterized by finitely many numbers. The theory is illustrated by many examples.

	abstract = {In infectious disease epidemiology, it is useful to know how quickly genetic markers of pathogenic agents evolve while inside hosts. We propose a modular framework with which these genotype change rates can be estimated. The estimation scheme requires a model of the underlying process of genetic change, a detection scheme that filters this process into observable quantities, and a monitoring scheme that describes the timing of observations. We study a linear "birth-shift-death" model for change in transposable element genotypes, obtaining maximum-likelihood estimators for various detection and monitoring schemes. The method is applied to serial genotypes of the transposon IS6110 in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The estimated birth rate of 0.0161 (events per copy of the transposon per year) and death rate of 0.0108 are both significantly larger than the estimated shift rate of 0.0018. The sum of these estimates, which corresponds to a "half-life" of 2.4 years for a typical strain that has 10 copies of the element, substantially exceeds a previous estimate of 0.0135 total changes per copy per year. We consider experimental design issues that enable the precision of estimates to be improved. We also discuss extensions to other markers and implications for molecular epidemiology. © 2003 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {An importance-sampling method is presented for computing the likelihood of the configuration of population genetic data under general assumptions about population history and transitions among states. The configuration of the data is the number of chromosomes sampled that are in each of a finite set of states. Transitions among states are governed by a Markov chain with transition probabilities dependent on one or more parameters. The method assumes that the joint distribution of coalescence times of the underlying gene genealogy is independent of the genetic state of each lineage. Given a set of coalescence times, the probability that a pair of lineages is chosen to coalesce in each replicate is proportional to the contribution that the coalescence event makes to the probability of the data. This method can be applied to gene genealogies generated by the neutral coalescent process and to genealogies generated by other processes, such as a linear birth-death process which provides a good approximation to the dynamics of low-frequency alleles. Two applications are described. In the first, the fit of allele frequencies at two microsatellite loci sampled in a Sardinian population to the one-step mutation model is tested. The one-step model is rejected for one locus but not for the other. The second application is to low-frequency alleles in a geographically subdivided population. The geographic location is the allelic state, and the alleles are assumed to be sufficiently rare that their dynamics can be approximated by a linear birth-death process in which the birth and death rates are independent of geographic location. The analysis of eight low-frequency allozyme alleles found in the glaucous-winged gull, Larus glaucescens, illustrates how geographically restricted dispersal can be detected. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

We obtained the basic reproduction ratio (R0) from the aggregated model, and then studied the effect of the migratory behavior of susceptible hosts on the ability of the parasite to invade the system.

	abstract = {Using properties of moment stationarity we develop exact expressions for the mean and covariance of allele frequencies at a single locus for a set of populations subject to drift, mutation, and migration. Some general results can be obtained even for arbitrary mutation and migration matrices, for example: (1) Under quite general conditions, the mean vector depends only on mutation rates, not on migration rates or the number of populations. (2) Allele frequencies covary among all pairs of populations connected by migration. As a result, the drift, mutation, migration process is not ergodic when any finite number of populations is exchanging genes. In addition, we provide closed-form expressions for the mean and covariance of allele frequencies in Wright's finite-island model of migration under several simple models of mutation, and we show that the correlation in allele frequencies among populations can be very large for realistic rates of mutation unless an enormous number of populations are exchanging genes. As a result, the traditional diffusion approximation provides a poor approximation of the stationary distribution of allele frequencies among populations. Finally, we discuss some implications of our results for measures of population structure based on Wright's F-statistics. © 2003 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.},

Indeed, some data do conform to this general pattern. Nevertheless, his hypothesis has generated some debate about the extent to which it is valid. I explore this issue quantitatively within the framework of mathematical epidemiology. In particular, I present a dynamic optimization model for the evolution of parasite replication strategies that explicitly explores the validity of this hypothesis. A few different model assumptions are explored and it is found that Ewald's hypothesis has only qualified support as a general explanation for why vector-borne parasites are more virulent than those that are directly transmitted. I conclude by suggesting that an alternative explanation might lie in differences in inoculum size between these two types of transmission. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).},

It is demonstrated that the product rule probability always underestimates the two-locus match probability. For highly mutable minisatellite loci, these probabilities can differ by an order of magnitude or more.

Specifically, the relations between the mean persistence time and higher-order moments for discrete-time Markov chain models, continuous-time Markov chain models, and stochastic differential equation models are compared for populations experiencing demographic variability. Similarities between the models are demonstrated analytically, and computational results are provided to show that estimated persistence times for the three stochastic models are generally in good agreement when the models are consistently formulated. As an example, the three stochastic models are applied to a population satisfying logistic growth. Logistic growth is interesting as different birth and death rates can yield the same logistic differential equation. However, the persistence behavior of the population is strongly dependent on the explicit forms for the birth and death rates. Computational results demonstrate how dramatically the mean persistence time can vary for different populations that experience the same logistic growth. © 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Since it is independent of the gene considered, this effect is uniform on the genome, even in diploid populations. For values of fertility correlation observed in human populations, we show that coalescence times are strongly but inhomogenously reduced and that the shape of gene genealogies is markedly unbalanced. Despite the fact that our simulations concern stationary populations, the former non-genetic effect is very similar to what has been described for populations of variable size such as populations passing through demographic bottleneck.

The first strategy: the pulse period is fixed, but the proportional constant E1 changes, which represents the fraction of pests killed by applying insecticide. For this scheme, two thresholds, E1 ** and E1* for E1 are obtained. If E 1≥E1*, both the pest and predator (natural enemies) populations go to extinction. If E1**<E 1<E1*, the pest population converges to the semi-trivial periodic solution while the predator population tends to zero. If E1 is less than E1** but even if close to E1**, there exists a unique positive periodic solution via bifurcation, which implies both the pest and the predator populations oscillate with a positive amplitude. In this case, pest population is killed to the maximum extent while the natural enemies are preserved to avoid extinction. The second strategy: the proportional constant E1 is fixed (E 1<E1* firstly), but the pulse period changes. For this scheme, one threshold τ0 for the pulse period τ is obtained. We can reach the same target as above by controlling the period impulsive effect τ<τ0, even if close to τ 0.

	abstract = {This study examines the influence of optimal patch choice by consumers on resource population dynamics and on consumer distribution in a two patch environment. The evolutionarily stable strategy which describes animal distributions across habitat patches is called the ideal free distribution (IFD) strategy. Two mechanisms that lead to the IFD are: (1) direct consumer competition such as interference, and (2) exploitative competition for resources. This article focuses on the second mechanism by assuming that resources undergo population dynamics while consumer abundance is fixed. Two models of resource growth are considered in detail: the exponential and the logistic. The corresponding consumer IFD is derived for each of these two models, assuming that consumers behave adaptively by moving to the patch which provides them with the highest fitness. This derivation does not require that resources are at an equilibrium, and it provides, for each resource density, the corresponding distribution of consumers. The article suggests that adaptive patch choice by consumers decreases between patch heterogeneity in resource levels and weakens the apparent competition between resources. The results for a single consumer population are extended for two competing consumer populations. The corresponding IFD is computed as a function of the two consumer densities. This allows for the analytical description of isolegs which are the boundary lines, in the two consumer density phase space, separating regions where qualitatively different habitat preferences are predicted. © 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

In an environment containing particles of different types of food, the model predicts the selection of an approximately optimal diet; in an environment in which the particles occur in patches, the model predicts a time budget of patch occupancy that approximates to the optimal time budget; and in an environment containing patches of particles that regenerate by the addition of particles of food at constant rates, the model predicts that animals will dispose themselves among the patches approximately as predicted by the ideal free distribution. Where the predictions of the model depart from the predictions of optimal foraging theory, they are qualitatively similar to the observed departures of the behaviour of real animals from the predictions of optimal foraging theory. The model provides a general representation of the foraging decisions of animals whether they feed strictly continuously or discontinuously on particles of food, and does so without explicit reference to optimization processes. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

Biol. 49 (1996) 265-290; 55 (1999) 111-126), the population dynamics resulting from a two-prey-one-predator system with adaptive predators was studied. In these articles, predators followed the predictions of optimal foraging theory. Analysis of that system was hindered by the incorporation of the logistic description of prey growth. In particular, because prey self-regulation dependence is a strong stabilizing mechanism, the effects of optimal foraging could not be easily separated from the effects of bottom-up control of prey growth on species coexistence. In this article, we analyze two models. The first model assumes the exponential growth of both prey types while the second model assumes the exponential growth of the preferred prey type and the logistic growth of the alternative prey type. This permits the effect of adaptive foraging on two-prey-predator food webs to be addressed. We show that optimal foraging reduces apparent competition between the two prey types, promotes species coexistence, and leads to multiple attractors. © 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

	abstract = {We show in this paper that the chaotic regimes of many food chain models often enjoy a very peculiar property, known as peak-to-peak dynamics. This means that the maximum (peak) density of the populations of any trophic level can be easily forecasted provided the last two peaks of the same population are known. Moreover, extensive simulation shows that only the last peak is needed if the forecast concerns the population at the top of the food chain and that peaks variability often increases from bottom to top. All these findings bring naturally to the conclusion that top populations should be sampled in order to have higher chances to detect peak-to-peak dynamics. The analysis is carried out by studying ditrophic food chain models with seasonally varying parameters, tritrophic food chain models with constant parameters, and more complex food chain and food web models. © 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

In this model, individuals imprint on a genetically transmitted trait during early ontogeny and choosy females later use those parental images as a criterion of mate choice. It is assumed that the presence or absence of the female preference is determined by a genetic locus. In order to incorporate such mechanisms as inbreeding depression and heterozygous advantage into our haploid framework, we assume that same-type matings are less fertile than different-type mating. The model suggests that: if all the females have a disassortative mating preference a viability-reducing trait may be maintained even without the fertility cost of same-type matings; a disassortative mating preference can be established even if it is initially rare, when there is a fertility cost of same-type matings. Further, an assortative mating preference is less likely to evolve than a disassortative mating preference. The model may be applicable to the evolution of MHC-disassortative mating preferences documented in house mice and humans. © 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The models exhibit four behaviors: persistence for all initial population densities, bistability in which a population persists for intermediate initial densities and otherwise goes extinct, extinction for all initial densities, and essential extinction in which "almost every" initial density leads to extinction. For fast-growing populations, these models show populations can persist at high levels of predation even though lower levels of predation lead to essential extinction. Alternatively, increasing the predator's handling time, the population's carrying capacity, or the likelihood of mating success may lead to essential extinction. In each of these cases, the mechanism behind these disappearances are chaotic dynamics driving populations below a critical threshold determined by the Allee effect. These disappearances are proceeded by chaotic transients that are proven to be approximately exponentially distributed in length and highly sensitive to initial population densities. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {Successful social groups must respond dynamically to environmental changes. However, a flexible group response requires the coordination of many individuals. Here we offer a static analytical model that integrates variation in environment-based cues for performance of a task with genetically and environmentally based variation in individual responses, and predicts the resultant colony behavior for that task. We also provide formulae for computing effective number of alleles in a haplo-diploid colony founded by any number of parents. Variable colony resources combined with variation among worker phenotypes generate known patterns of colony flexibility, allowing us to explicitly test how the number of loci, dominance/codominance, and the phenotype's environment influences group response. Our model indicates that the number of loci strongly influences colony behavior. For one or two loci, the proportion of workers foraging for pollen remain constant over vast increases in colony pollen stores, but then drops dramatically when the pollen stores increase past a specific threshold. As the number of loci controlling pollen foraging increases, graded increases in pollen stores result in a graded drop in the proportion of the worker population foraging for pollen. The effect of number of alleles is less strong, a result we discuss in light of the fact that a low number of effective alleles are expected in a colony. Comparisons of our model with empirical honey bee (Apis mellifera) data indicate that worker foraging response to pollen stores is driven by one or two loci, each with dominant allelic effects. The growing body of evidence that genotype has strong effects on task performance in social insect colonies, and the variation in within-colony genetic diversity across social insect taxa, make our model broadly applicable in explaining social group coordination. © 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

The vector spreads only between hosts occupying the same neighborhood, and the number of hosts varies randomly among neighborhoods. Simulation of a spatially detailed model shows that increasing heterogeneity in host abundance reduces pathogen prevalence. Clumping of hosts can limit the advance of the vector, which inhibits the spread of infection indirectly. Clumping can also increase the chance that the pathogen and vector become physically separated during the initial phase of the epidemic process. The latter limitation on the pathogen's spread, in our simulations, is restricted to small interaction neighborhoods. A mean-field model, which does not maintain spatial correlations between sites, approximates simulation results when hosts are arrayed uniformly, but overestimates infection prevalence when hosts are aggregated. A pair approximation, which includes some of the simulation model's spatial correlations, better describes the vector infestation frequencies across host spatial dispersions. © 2001 Academic Press.},

	abstract = {Coevolved mutualisms, such as those between senita cacti, yuccas, and their respective obligate pollinators, benefit both species involved in the interaction. However, in these pollination mutualisms the pollinator's larvae impose a cost on plants through consumption of developing seeds and fruit. The effects of pollinators on benefits and costs are expected to vary with the abundance of pollinators, because large population sizes result in more eggs and larval seed-eaters. Here, we develop the hypothesis that fruit abortion, which is common in yucca, senita, and plants in general, could in some cases have the function of limiting pollinator abundance and, thereby, increasing fruit production. Using a general steady-state model of fruit production and pollinator dynamics, we demonstrate that plants involved in pollinating seed-eater mutualisms can increase their fecundity by randomly aborting fruit. We show that the ecological conditions under which fruit abortion can improve plants fecundity are not unusual. They are best met when the plant is long-lived, the population dynamics of the pollinator are much faster than those of the plant, the loss of one fruit via abortion kills a larva that would have the expectation of destroying more than one fruit through its future egg laying as an adult moth, and the effects of fruit abortion on pollinator abundance are spatially localized. We then use the approach of adaptive dynamics to find conditions under which a fruit abortion strategy based on regulating the pollinator population could feasibly evolve in this type of plant-pollinator interaction. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).},

	abstract = {We present the minimum set of requirements necessary and sufficient to represent the foraging behaviour of an animal, and its utilisation of food, in order to explore the emergent properties of behaviour that allow animals to reduce their hunger. We present an individual-based model of foraging that provides a simple quantification of the requirements, which is sufficiently simple to yield some analytical results. Complex interactions beyond the scope of analysis have been explored through simulating animals foraging in regenerating patchy environments. In most cases the populations pass into equilibrium distributions which appear to be stable. The equilibria always approximate closely to the ideal free distribution, although typically with a small degree of undermatching. (Undermatching is the term applied to the departure from the ideal free distribution caused by a smaller proportion of the population than expected occupying areas with a higher than average regeneration rate). The model therefore implies that the distribution, hitherto accounted for in terms of ESSs may, in fact, be simply an effect of the animal's utilization of the food it collects to reduce its hunger. The model defines a specific feeling rate, v, the rate at which an animal can feed on a unit of food. This is a function of three parameters, v1, the specific feeding rate when alone, v∞, the rate, possibly zero, at which it can feed in the presence of an indefinitely large number of conspecifics, and n1/2, the number of conspecifics that cause v to take the value (v1 + v∞)/2. Exploitation competition in the absence of interference is represented by setting v1 = v∞. Differences in competitive ability in exploitation have been represented by simulating animals with a range of values of v1, those with the larger values, feeding more rapidly, being the more effective competitors, and those with the lower values being the less effective. Interference competition is represented by setting v1 > v∞ and social facilitation by v1 < v∞. Individual differences in the strength of interaction are represented by different values of n1/2. In competition, the animals with the larger values of n1/2 are the more effective competitors: in facilitation, they are the less effective facilitators. The addition of physiological and behavioural detail makes very little alteration to the emergent equilibria, always close to the ideal free distribution, almost always showing undermatching. © 2001 Academic Press.},

	abstract = {A theoretical model is developed of the fate of mutations for organisms with such life-history characteristics as indeterminate growth and clonal reproduction. It focuses on how the fate of a particular mutant depends on whether it arises during mitotic cell division (somatic mutation) or during meiotic cell division (meiotic mutation). At gamete production, individuals carrying somatic mutations will produce some proportion of gametes reflecting the original, zygotic genotype and some proportion reflecting genotypes carrying the somatic mutation. Focusing on allele frequencies at gamete production allows the effects of growth and clonal reproduction to be summarized. The relative strengths of somatic and meiotic mutation can be determined, as well as the conditions under which the change in allele frequency due to one is greater than that due to the other. Examples from a published demographic study of clonal corals are used to compare somatic and meiotic mutation. When there is no selection acting on either type of mutation, only a few cell divisions per time unit on average are needed for the change in allele frequency due to somatic mutation to be greater, given empirically based mutation rates. When somatic selection is added, the most dramatic effect is seen with fairly strong negative selection acting against the somatic mutation within individuals. In this case, selection within organisms can effectively counteract the effects of somatic mutation, and the change in allele frequency due to somatic mutations will not be greater than that due to meiotic mutations for reasonable numbers of within-generation cell divisions. The majority of the mutation load, which would have been due to somatic mutation, is purged by selection within the individual organism. © 2001 Academic Press.},

	abstract = {Horizontal gene transfer is the collective name for processes that permit the exchange of DNA among organisms of different species. Only recently has it been recognized as a significant contribution to inter-organismal gene exchange. Traditionally, it was thought that microorganisms evolved clonally, passing genes from mother to daughter cells with little or no exchange of DNA among diverse species. Studies of microbial genomes, however, have shown that genomes contain genes that are closely related to a number of different prokaryotes, sometimes to phylogenetically very distantly related ones.

Whereas prokaryotic and eukaryotic evolution was once reconstructed from a single 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene, the analysis of complete genomes is beginning to yield a different picture of microbial evolution, one that is wrought with the lateral movement of genes across vast phylogenetic distances.

We found that the stabilization yielded by aggregation depends strongly on the mechanism producing the aggregation: multiple infections are much less stabilizing than when aggregation is assumed to be fixed from the outside, while the opposite holds for host heterogeneity. We also give analytical estimates of the period of oscillations occurring when the equilibrium is unstable. Finally, we explore in these models the role of aggregation in host regulation and in determining a threshold value for parasite establishment. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).},

Plants living in a riverbed often experience a disturbance before they reproduce, suffering major fitness loss. Plants reproducing prior to the flood season are free from the risk of lost reproduction, but a small flowering plant can produce only a few numbers of seeds. If the date of disturbance is unpredictable, a mixed strategy of reproductive timing may evolve in which individuals of the same genotype have different reproductive dates. We calculate the evolutionarily stable phenotype distribution analytically. Depending on parameters, the ESS distribution is either (1) a timid strategy - the plant reproduces when small, prior to the major disturbance season; (2) a bold strategy - the plant reproduces only when it is fully grown; (3) a mixture of early and late reproduction; or (4) dates of reproduction spread over a wide interval. We also examine the effects of developmental and environmental noises that make realized flowering dates deviate from that programmed by the genotype, which follows the ESS distribution. In the presence of noise, the ESS distribution of programmed timing of reproduction is discrete. © 2001 Academic Press.},

The effective size is larger (resp. smaller) than the harmonic mean when the fluctuations of population size are positively (resp. negatively) autocorrelated. Further, we obtain some asymptotic expressions for effective size when the population size is very large and/or the autocorrelation of the fluctuation is very strong. © 2001 Academic Press.},

The model is focused on the population-level consequences of the antipredator behavior, performed by the rodent population, which is assumed to be an inducible response of predation avoidance. The decrease in vulnerability is explicitly considered to have two associated costs: a decreasing foraging success and an increasing metabolic loss. The model analysis was carried out on a reduced form of the system by means of numerical and analytical tools. We evaluated the stability properties of equilibrium points in the phase plane, and carried out bifurcation analyses of rodent equilibrium density under varying conditions of three relevant parameters. The bifurcation parameters chosen represent predator avoidance effectiveness (A), foraging cost of antipredator behavior (C′1), and activity-metabolism cost (C′4). Our analysis suggests that the trade-offs involved in antipredator behavior plays a fundamental role in the stability properties of the system. Under conditions of high foraging cost, stability decreases as antipredator effectiveness increases. Under the complementary scenario (not considering the highest foraging costs), the equilibria are either stable when both costs are low, or unstable when both costs are higher, independent of antipredator effectiveness. No evidence of stabilizing effects of antipredator behavior was found. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).},

The power of the tests to detect genetic differentiation in Wright-Fisher island models and stepping stone models was calculated for various sample sizes, rates of migration and mutation, and definitions of spatial neighborhoods.

Evol. 9, 138-151, 1992), but in all cases was slightly less powerful than both a traditional X2 test without lumping of rare haplotypes and the Snn test of Hudson (Genetics 155, 2011-2014, 2000). However, when we applied our new tests to three data sets, we found in some cases highly significant results that were missed by the other tests. © 2001 Academic Press.},

	abstract = {We consider using the ancestral selection graph (ASG) to simulate samples from population genetic models with selection. Currently the use of the ASG to simulate samples is limited. This is because the computational requirement for simulating samples increases exponentially with the selection rate and also due to needing to simulate a sample of size one from the population at equilibrium. For the only case where the distribution of a sample of size one is known, that of parent-independent mutations, more efficient simulation algorithms exist. We will show that by applying the idea of coupling from the past to the ASG, samples can be simulated from a general K-allele model without knowledge of the distribution of a sample of size one. Furthermore, the computation involved in generating such samples appears to be less than that of simulating the ASG until its ultimate ancestor. In particular, in the case of genic selection with parent-independent mutations, the computational requirement increases only quadratically with the selection rate. The algorithm is demonstrated by simulating samples at a microsatellite locus. © 2001 Academic Press.},

	abstract = {The extinction process of fragmented populations, characterized by a small number of conspecifics inhabiting each patch, is heavily affected by natural and human disturbance. To evaluate the risk of extinction we consider a network of identical patches connected by passive or active dispersal and hosting a finite, discrete number of individuals. We discuss three types of disturbance affecting the metapopulation: permanent loss of habitat patches, erosion of existing patches, and random catastrophes that wipe out the entire population of a patch. Starting from an infinite-dimensional Markov model that fully accounts for demographic stochasticity, we reduce it to finite dimension via moment closure with negative-binomial approximation. The compact models obtained in this way account for the dynamics of the fraction of empty patches, the average number of individuals in occupied patches, and the variance of their distribution. After comparing the performance of these compact models with that of the infinite-dimensional model in the case of no disturbances, we then proceed to computing persistence-extinction boundaries as bifurcation lines of the compact models in the space of demographic and disturbance parameters. We consider bifurcations with respect to demographic and environmental parameters and contrast our results with those of previous theories. We find out that environmental catastrophes increase the risk of extinction for both frequent and infrequent dispersers, while the random loss of patches has a much larger influence on frequent dispersers. This influence can be counterbalanced by active dispersal. Local erosion of habitat fragments has a larger influence on infrequent than on frequent dispersers. We finally discuss the important synergistic effects of disturbances acting simultaneously. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).},

	abstract = {Uncovering why spatial mosaics of mimetic morphs are maintained in a Müllerian mimicry system has been a challenging issue in evolutionary biology. In this article, we analyze the reaction diffusion system that describes two-species Müllerian mimicry in one- and two-dimensional habitats. Due to positive frequency-dependent selection, a local population first approaches the state where one of the comimicking patterns predominates, which is followed by slow movement of boundaries where different patterns meet. We then analyze the interfacial dynamics of the boundaries to find whether a stable cline is maintained and to obtain the wave speed if the cline is unstable. The results are: (1) In a spatially uniform habitat the morph with greater base fitness spreads both in one and two species system. (2) The strength of cross-species interaction determines whether the mimetic morph clines of model and mimic species coalesce into the same geographical region or pass through each other. The joint wave speed of clines decreases by increasing the number of comimicking species in the mimicry ring. (3) In spatial heterogeneous habitats, stable clines can be maintained due to the balance between the base fitness gradient and the biased gene flow by negative curvature of boundary. This allows the persistence of a spatial mosaic even if one of the morphs is in every place advantageous over the other. A balanced cline is also maintained if there is a gradient in the population density. (4) A new advantageous morph occurring at a local region is doomed to go to extinction in a finite time if the "radius" of initial distribution is below a threshold. Possible applications to the heliconiine butterfly mimicry ring, heterozygous disadvantage systems of chromosomal rearrangement and hybrid zone, the third phase of Wright's Shifting Balance theory, and cytoplasmic incompatibility are discussed. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).},

	abstract = {The evidence for dispersal activity among soil-living invertebrates comes mainly from observations of their movement on artificial substrates or of colonisation of defaunated soils in the field. In an attempt to elucidate the dispersal pattern of soil collembolans in the presence of conspecifics, statistical analyses were undertaken to describe and simulate the movement of groups of Onychiurus armatus released in trays of homogeneous soil. A χ 2 test was used to reject the null hypothesis that individuals moved independently of each other and uniformly in all directions. The mean radial distance moved (1-2cmday-1) and the radial standard deviation varied temporally and with the density of conspecifics. To capture the interaction between the moving individuals, four dispersal models (pure diffusion, diffusion with drift interaction, drift interaction and synchronised diffusion, and drift interaction and behavioural mood), were formulated as stochastic differential equations. The parameters of the models were estimated by minimising the deviance between the observed replicates and replicates that were simulated using the models. The dynamics of movement were best described by modelling the drift interaction as dependent on whether individuals were in a social or an asocial mood. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).},

Given a sample of mutation-bearing, two-marker haplotypes, the maximum likelihood estimate of the location of the disease mutation can be calculated from the generated sampling distribution, provided that one knows enough about the population history in order to model it. The two-marker likelihood method is compared to a single-marker likelihood and a composite likelihood. The two-marker maximum likelihood gives smaller confidence intervals for the location of the disease locus than a comparable single-marker maximum likelihood. The composite likelihood can give biased results and the bias increases as the extent of linkage disequilibrium on mutation-bearing chromosomes decreases. Haplotype configurations exist for which the composite likelihood will fail to place the disease locus in the correct marker interval. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).},

	abstract = {We revisit the classical population genetics model of a population evolving under multiplicative selection, mutation, and drift. The number of beneficial alleles in a multilocus system can be considered a trait under exponential selection. Equations of motion are derived for the cumulants of the trait distribution in the diffusion limit and under the assumption of linkage equilibrium. Because of the additive nature of cumulants, this reduces to the problem of determining equations of motion for the expected allele distribution cumulants at each locus. The cumulant equations form an infinite dimensional linear system and in an authored appendix Adam Prügel-Bennett provides a closed form expression for these equations. We derive approximate solutions which are shown to describe the dynamics well for a broad range of parameters. In particular, we introduce two approximate analytical solutions: (1) Perturbation theory is used to solve the dynamics for weak selection and arbitrary mutation rate. The resulting expansion for the system's eigenvalues reduces to the known diffusion theory results for the limiting cases with either mutation or selection absent. (2) For low mutation rates we observe a separation of time-scales between the slowest mode and the rest which allows us to develop an approximate analytical solution for the dominant slow mode. The solution is consistent with the perturbation theory result and provides a good approximation for much stronger selection intensities. © 2001 Academic Press.},

	abstract = {We analyze the equilibrium behavior of deterministic haploid mutation-selection models. To this end, both the forward and the time-reversed evolution processes are considered. The stationary state of the latter is called the ancestral distribution, which turns out as a key for the study of mutation-selection balance. We find that the ancestral genotype frequencies determine the sensitivity of the equilibrium mean fitness to changes in the corresponding fitness values and discuss implications for the evolution of mutational robustness. We further show that the difference between the ancestral and the population mean fitness, termed mutational loss, provides a measure for the sensitivity of the equilibrium mean fitness to changes in the mutation rate. The interrelation of the loss and the mutation load is discussed. For a class of models in which the number of mutations in an individual is taken as the trait value, and fitness is a function of the trait, we use the ancestor formulation to derive a simple maximum principle, from which the mean and variance of fitness and the trait may be derived; the results are exact for a number of limiting cases, and otherwise yield approximations which are accurate for a wide range of parameters. These results are applied to threshold phenomena caused by the interplay of selection and mutation (known as error thresholds). They lead to a clarification of concepts, as well as criteria for the existence of error thresholds. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).},

	abstract = {Simple conditions to evaluate the persistence of populations living in fragmented habitats are of primary importance in ecology. We address this need here using a spatially implicit approach that accounts for discrete individuals in a metapopulation. Demographic stochasticity is incorporated into a Markovian model in a natural way, as local extinction is characterized by the death or the dispersal of the last individual inhabiting a patch. The variables of the model are the probabilities pi (i=0, 1, 2...) that a patch be occupied by a finite, integer number i of individuals at a given time. We compare the stationary distributions predicted by the model with field data and discuss the role of dispersal in determining different distributions of local abundances. The analysis of the model leads to a persistence criterion which is equivalent to a condition formerly proved by Chesson (Z. Wahrscheinlichkeitstheor. 66, 97-107, 1984) namely that E0>1, where E0 is the expected number of successful dispersers from a patch begun with one individual and to which immigration is excluded. We provide an analytic way of computing E0 as a function of the main biological characteristics of the species (natality, mortality and dispersal rates, and colonizing ability). We can thus obtain persistence-extinction boundaries in the space of model parameters. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).},

First, outbreaks will typically last for only 2 generations after parasitoids begin to reduce the host population below the maximum density. Second, host growth rate is important in determining cycle length only when parasitoids attack before the impacts of resource limitation affect the host. The robustness of these predictions are tested using a more general form of density dependence in the host, revealing that our predictions are valid as long as density dependence in the host is not too overcompensatory. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).},

The effects of including more realistic descriptions of the infectious period within SIR (susceptible/infectious/recovered) models are studied. Less dispersed distributions are seen to have two important epidemiological consequences. First, less stable behaviour is seen within the model: incidence patterns become more complex, Second, disease persistence is diminished: in models with a finite population, the minimum population size needed to allow disease persistence increases. The assumption made concerning the infectious period distribution is of a kind routinely made in the formulation of mathematical models in population biology. Since it has a major effect on the central issues of population persistence and dynamics, the results of this study have broad implications for mathematical modellers of a wide range of biological systems. © 2001 Academic Press.},

	abstract = {Autoparasitoids ("heteronomous hyperparasitoids") are parasitoids that lay female eggs on homopteran hosts and male eggs on juvenile parasitoids of either the same species or another species. Males develop as hyperparasitoids and eventually kill the juvenile parasitoid. We present a series of stage-structured models that investigate the effects of autoparasitism on population dynamics. Autoparasitism causes density-dependent mortality on juvenile parasitoids and therefore has a stabilizing effect. This also leads to an increase in host population abundance. In most cases an autoparasitoid leads to higher host equilibrium densities than a comparable primary parasitoid (except when the primary parasitoid is arrhenotokous (sexual) and the autoparasitoid has a low preference for attacking parasitized hosts or can attack the parasitized host for only a small portion of its development). When male autoparasitoids are followed explicitly in the models, mate limitation reduces the stabilizing effect of autoparasitism and leads to a further increase in host abundance. Coexistence of an autoparasitoid with a nonprimary parasitoid or second autoparasitoid is possible when the level of conspecific autoparasitism is greater than the level of heterospecific autoparasitism. When an autoparasitoid coexists with a primary parasitoid, the resulting host density is always greater than that with only the primary parasitoid. Therefore, autoparasitoids have the potential to disrupt control achieved by primary parasitoids. When two autoparasitoids coexist, the resulting host density is always lower than that attained by either autoparasitoid alone. The effects of autoparasitism are compared with those of other forms of interference competition. © 2001 Academic Press.},

To differentiate this theory from earlier interpretations of Baldwin's ideas, we name it the Baldwin expediting effect. Models that demonstrate this effect assume an extreme fitness scenario which bestows high fitness upon a single optimal phenotype and treats all other phenotypes as equal. In two modeling frameworks, we demonstrate that the effects of plasticity on the rate of evolution are highly dependent on the fitness function and population starting conditions. We argue that phenotypic plasticity does not universally facilitate evolution. Furthermore, in cases where the Baldwin expediting effect occurs, it is not necessarily correlated with increased fitness and therefore is not sufficient to explain the evolutionary success of plasticity. © 2000 Academic Press.},

The model allows for variation in the sizes of demes, in contributions to the migrant pool, and in the fraction of each deme that is replaced by migrants every generation. The ancestry of a sample of non-recombining DNA sequences has a simple structure when the sample size is much smaller than the total number of demes in the population. This allows an expression for the probability distribution of the number of segregating sites in the sample to be derived under the infinite-sites mutation model. It also yields easily computed estimators of the migration parameter for each deme in a multi-deme sample. The genealogical process is such that the lineages ancestral to the sample tend to accumulate in demes with low migration rates and/or which contribute disproportionately to the migrant pool. In addition, common ancestor or coalescent events tend to occur in demes of small size. This provides a framework for understanding the determinants of the effective size of the population, and leads to an expression for the probability that the root of a genealogy occurs in a particular geographic region, or among a particular set of demes. © 2001 Academic Press.},

This expectation follows from regarding association as being proportional to linkage disequilibrium and therefore inversely related to recombination value. For disease genes with more than two alleles, the association measure is instead a weighted average of linkage disequilibria, with the weights depending on allele frequencies and genotype susceptibilities at the disease loci. There is no longer a simple relationship, even in expectation, with recombination. We adopt a general framework to examine association mapping methods which helps to clarify the nature of case-control and transmission/disequilibrium-type tests and reveals the relationship between measures of association and coefficients of linkage disequilibrium. In particular, we can show the consequences of additive and nonadditive effects at the trait locus on the behavior of these tests. These concepts have a natural extension to marker haplotypes. The association of two-locus marker haplotypes with disease phenotype depends on a weighted average of three-locus disequilibria (two markers with each disease locus). It is likely that these two-marker analyses will provide additional information in association mapping studies. © 2001 Elsevier Science.},

The continuum formulation allows computation of average fitness at the population level by taking account of both local fitness and the spatial distribution of the population. An example shows that the average fitness may have a different form than the local fitness; in particular, if local fitness is described by a logistic equation at each location, the average fitness may obey the θ-logistic equation of F.

	abstract = {We model a metapopulation of predator-prey patches using both spatially implicit or mean-field (MF) and spatially explicit (SE) approaches. We show that in the MF model there are parameter regimes for which prey cannot persist in the absence of predators, but can in their presence. In addition, there are parameter regimes for which prey may persist in isolation, but the presence of predators will increase prey patch density. Predators may thus enhance prey persistence and overall abundance. The key mechanism responsible for this effect is the occurrence of prey dispersal from patches that are occupied by both prey and predators. In addition, these patches should be either long-lived, such as that occurs when predators keep prey from overexploiting its local resource, or the presence of a predator on a patch should significantly enhance the prey dispersal out of that patch. In the SE approach these positive effects of predators on prey persistence and abundance occur for even larger parameter ranges than in the MF model. Prey dispersal from predator-prey patches may thus be important for persistence of both species as a community, independent of the modeling framework studied. Comparison of the MF and SE approaches shows that local dispersal constraints can have the edge over global dispersal for the persistence of the metapopulation in regimes where the two species have a beneficial effect on each other. In general, our model provides an example of feedback in multiple-species metapopulations that can make the implementation of conservation schemes based on single-species arguments very risky. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).},

	abstract = {We consider a bitrophic spatially distributed community consisting of prey and actively moving predators. The model is based on the assumption that the spatial and temporal variations of the predators' velocity are determined by the prey gradient. Locally, the populations follow the simple Lotka-Volterra interaction. We also assume predator reproduction and mortality to be negligible in comparison with the time scale of migration. The model demonstrates heterogeneous oscillating distributions of both species, which occur because of the active movements of predators. One consequence of this heterogeneity is increased viability of the prey population, compared to the equivalent homogeneous model, and increased consumption. Further numerical analysis shows that, on the spatially aggregated scale, the average predator density adversely affects the individual consumption, leading to a nonlinear predator-dependent trophic function, completely different from the Lotka-Volterra rule assumed at the local scale. © 2001 Academic Press.},

	abstract = {This article seeks to determine the extent to which endogenous consumer-resource cycles can contribute to the coexistence of competing consumer species. It begins with a numerical analysis of a simple model proposed by Armstrong and McGehee. This model has a single resource and two consumers, one with a linear functional response and one with a saturating response. Coexistence of the two consumer species can occur when the species with a saturating response generates population cycles of the resource, and also has a lower resource requirement for zero population growth. Coexistence can be achieved over a wide range of relative efficiencies of the two consumers provided that the functional response of the saturating consumer reaches its half-saturation value when the resource population is a small fraction of its carrying capacity. In this case, the range of efficiencies allowing coexistence is comparable to that when two competitors have stable dynamics and a high degree of resource partitioning. A variety of modifications of this basic model are analyzed to investigate the consequences for coexistence of different resource growth equations, different functional and numerical response shapes, and other factors. Large differences in functional response shape appear to be the most important factor in producing robust coexistence via resource cycles. If the unstable species has a concave numerical response, this greatly expands the conditions allowing coexistence. If the stable consumer species has a convex (accelerating) functional and/or numerical response, the range of conditions allowing coexistence is also expanded. We argue that large between-species differences in functional response form can often be produced by between-consumer differences in the adaptive adjustments of foraging effort to food density. Consumer-resource cycles can also expand the conditions allowing coexistence when there is resource partitioning, but do so primarily when resource partitioning is relatively slight; this makes the ease of coexistence relatively independent of consumer similarity. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).},

Six epistatic models, used in the analysis of binary disease traits, were considered. Ancestral values in an infinitely large panmictic population were compared with their expectations at equilibrium, after t consecutive bottlenecks of equal size N (derived values). An increase in the additive variance after bottlenecks (inversely related to N and t) will occur only if the frequencies of the negative allele at each locus are: (1) low, invariably associated to strong inbreeding depression; (2) high, always accompanied by an enhancement of the mean with inbreeding. The latter is an undesirable property, making the pertinent models unsuitable for the genetic analysis of disease. For the epistatic models considered, it is unlikely that the rate of evolution may be accelerated after population bottlenecks, in spite of occasional increments of the derived additive variance over its ancestral value.

By analyzing the invasion chances of rare alleles, we provide an analytical justification of earlier simulation results. We show that a new distorter allele can successfully invade even if it is inferior both at the gamete and at the individual level. In fact, newly arising distorter alleles have an inherent rareness advantage if their negative fitness consequences are restricted to homozygous condition. Likewise, rare mutant wildtype alleles may often invade even if their viability or fertility is reduced. As a consequence, the competition between alleles at a segregation distorter locus should lead to a high degree of polymorphism.

	abstract = {Periphyton is a key component of the Everglades ecosystems. It is a major primary producer, providing food and habitat for a variety of organisms, contributing material to the surface soil, and regulating water chemistry. Periphyton is sensitive to the phosphorus (P) supply and P enrichment has caused dramatic changes in the native Everglades periphyton assemblages. Periphyton also affects P availability by removing P from the water column and depositing a refractory portion into sediment. A quantitative understanding of the response of periphyton assemblages to P supply and its effects on P cycling could provide critical supports to decision making in the conservation and restoration of the Everglades. We constructed a model to examine the interaction between periphyton and P dynamics. The model contains two differential equations: P uptake and periphyton growth are assumed to follow the Monod equation and are limited by a modified logistic equation. Equilibrium and stability analyses suggest that P loading is the driving force and determines the system behavior. The position and number of steady states and the stability also depend upon the rate of sloughing, through which periphyton deposits refractory P into sediment. Multiple equilibria may exist, with two stable equilibria separated by an unstable equilibrium. Due to nonlinear interplay of periphyton and P in this model, catastrophe and hysteresis are likely to occur. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).},

When Σm(t) is about one, the variance of the number of nucleotide differences becomes large, where Σm(t) is the sum of the migration rate for the period of migration. The distribution of the estimated divergence time was also obtained using computer simulations. It was found that the divergence time can be explained by Σm(t).

	abstract = {With the advent of new molecular marker technologies, it is now feasible to initiate genome projects for outcrossing plant species, which have not received much attention in genetic research, despite their great agricultural and environmental value. Because outcrossing species typically have heterogeneous genomes, data structure for molecular markers representing an entire genome is complex: some markers may have more alleles than others, some markers are codominant whereas others are dominant, and some markers are heterozygous in one parent but fixed in the other parent whereas the opposite can be true for other markers. A major difficulty in analyzing these different types of marker at the same time arises from uncertainty about parental linkage phases over markers. In this paper, we present a general maximum-likelihood- based algorithm for simultaneously estimating linkage and linkage phases for a mixed set of different marker types containing fully informative markers (segregating 1:1:1:1) and partially informative markers (or missing markers, segregating 1:2:1, 3:1, and 1:1) in a full-sib family derived from two outbred parent plants. The characterization of linkage phases is based on the posterior probability distribution of the assignment of alternative alleles at given markers to two homologous chromosomes of each parent, conditional on the observed phenotypes of the markers. Two- and multi-point analyses are performed to estimate the recombination fraction and determine the most likely linkage phase between different types of markers. A numerical example is presented to demonstrate the statistical properties of the model for characterizing the linkage phase between markers. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).},

In one bacterial line, comparison between the model and the data suggests that pivotal mutations mediated by insertion sequences account for a large part of bacterial adaptation. In a more detailed analysis of one simulation, it was shown that only 0.01% of the mutations generated by a population over 10,000 generations can go to fixation as a consequence of their improved fitness.

	abstract = {Traditional views on deep evolutionary events have been seriously challenged over the last few years, following the identification of major pitfalls affecting molecular phylogeny reconstruction. Here we describe the principally encountered artifacts, notably long branch attraction, and their causes (i.e., difference in evolutionary rates, mutational saturation, compositional biases). Additional difficulties due to phenomena of biological nature (i.e., lateral gene transfer, recombination, hidden paralogy) are also discussed. Moreover, contrary to common beliefs, we show that the use of rare genomic events can also be misleading and should be treated with the same caution as standard molecular phylogeny. The universal tree of life, as described in most textbooks, is partly affected by tree reconstruction artifacts, e.g. (i) the bacterial rooting of the universal tree of life; (ii) the early emergence of amitochondriate lineages in eukaryotic phylogenies; and (iii) the position of hyperthermophilic taxa in bacterial phylogenies. We present an alternative view of this tree, based on recent evidence obtained from reanalyses of ancient data sets and from novel analyses of large combination of genes. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).},

	abstract = {We extend the classical model for selection at an autosomal locus in a sex-differentiated population to include segregation distortion. The equations remain the same, but the fitness parameters are interpreted differently and refer to alleles instead of genotypes. We derive conditions for internal and external stability of the equilibria, i.e., stability with respect to perturbations of alleles that are already present at equilibrium and stability with respect to invasion attempts by newly arising alleles. We show that, in a sex-differentiated population, external stability of an equilibrium can be judged on the basis of Shaw-Mohler criteria. Throughout, we compare the situation in populations with and without sex differentiation. Interestingly, internal stability is more difficult to achieve in a population without sex differentiation than in a population in which selection and segregation distortion are restricted to one sex. In a companion paper we show how the general results of the present paper can lead to new insights into specific systems such as the t complex of the house mouse. © 2001 Elsevier Science.},

A recent frequency-dependent model suggests that dynamics within mycorrhizal mutualisms could promote the coexistence of at least two competing plant species and two competing fungal species within a community. Models are developed here in which simultaneous association with multiple partners may result in elevated or depressed fitness relative to association with either partner alone. This increases the range of conditions under which negative feedback occurs and coexistence of all four species is possible. Differences between plants in the relative proportions of fungi at which maximum fitness occurs may facilitate coexistence, as may differences between fungi in their abilities to establish interplant connections. These models suggest additional mechanisms by which mutualistic interactions could promote local diversity of plants and AM fungi. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).},

There are certain difficulties associated with the use of this distribution in practice, some of which we address in this paper (others in the companion paper, Oprea and Kepler, Theor. Popul. Biol., 2001). The distribution is difficult to compute exactly, especially for large values of the random variable. To overcome this problem, we derive an integral representation of the Luria-Delbrück distribution that can be computed easily for large culture sizes. In addition, we introduce the usual assumption of very small probability of having a large proportion of mutants only after the generating function has been computed. Thus, we obtain information on the moments for the more general case. We examine the asymptotic behavior of this system. We find a scaling or "standardization" technique that reduces the family of distributions parameterized by three parameters (mutation rate, initial cell number, and final cell number) to a single distribution with no parameters, valid so long as the product of the mutation rate and the final culture is sufficiently large. We provide a pair of techniques for computing confidence intervals for the mutation rate. In the second paper of this series, we use the distribution derived here to find approximate distributions for the case where the cell cycle time is not well-described as an exponential random variable as is implicitly assumed by Luria-Delbrück distribution. © 2001 Academic Press.},

	abstract = {We model metapopulation dynamics in finite networks of discrete habitat patches with given areas and spatial locations. We define and analyze two simple and ecologically intuitive measures of the capacity of the habitat patch network to support a viable metapopulation. Metapopulation persistence capacity λM defines the threshold condition for long-term metapopulation persistence as λM > δ, where δ is defined by the extinction and colonization rate parameters of the focal species, Metapopulation invasion capacity λl sets the condition for successful invasion of an empty network from one small local population as λl > δ. The metapopulation capacities λM and λl are defined as the leading eigenvalue or a comparable quantity of an appropriate "landscape" matrix. Based on these definitions, we present a classification of a very general class of deterministic, continuous-time and discrete-time metapopulation models. Two specific models are analyzed in greater detail: a spatially realistic version of the continuous-time Levins model and the discrete-time incidence function model with propagule size-dependent colonization rate and a rescue effect. In both models we assume that the extinction rate increases with decreasing patch area and that the colonization rate increases with patch connectivity. In the spatially realistic Levins model, the two types of metapopulation capacities coincide, whereas the incidence function model possesses a strong Allee effect characterized by λl=0. For these two models, we show that the metapopulation capacities can be considered as simple sums of contributions from individual habitat patches, given by the elements of the leading eigenvector or comparable quantities. We may therefore assess the significance of particular habitat patches, including new patches that might be added to the network, for the metapopulation capacities of the network as a whole. We derive useful approximations for both the threshold conditions and the equilibrium states in the two models. The metapopulation capacities and the measures of the dynamic significance of particular patches can be calculated for real patch networks for applications in metapopulation ecology, landscape ecology, and conservation biology. © 2001 Elsevier Science.},

	abstract = {Conflicting results often accompany phylogenetic analyses of RNA, DNA, or protein sequences across diverse species. Causes contributing to these conflicts relate to ambiguities in identifying homologous characters of alignments, sensitivity of tree-making methods to unequal evolutionary rates, biases in species sampling, unrecognized paralogy, functional differentiation, loss of phylogenetic informational content due to long branches or fast evolution, and difficulties with the assumptions and approximations used to infer phylogenetic relationships. Attempts to surmount these conflicts by averaging over many proteins are problematic due to inherent biases of selected families, lack of signal in others, and events of lateral transfer, fusion, and/or chimerism. The process of assessing reliability of the results using the bootstrap method is strewn with obstacles because of lack of independence and inhomogeneity in the molecular data. Problems inherent to the three major procedures for developing phylogenetic trees - parsimony, likelihood, distance - are reviewed. Special attention is given to the problem of inferring evolutionary distances from patterns of similarity among sequences. The difficulties encountered by methods of phylogenetic reconstructions based on the analysis of divergent sequence families make new methods based on the analysis of complete genomes reasonable alternatives. Several of these are considered, including the signature sequences of Gupta and associates, the study of genome profiles, and the genomic signature set forth by Karlin and colleagues. © 2001 Academic Press.},

Depending on the direction of the perturbation, transient time may either denote the time until extinction (or until the population has decreased to a lower equilibrium level), or the recovery time needed to reach a higher equilibrium level. In the metapopulation context, the length of the transient time is set by the interplay between population dynamics and landscape structure. Assuming a spatially realistic metapopulation model, we show that transient time is a product of four factors: the strength of the perturbation, the ratio between the metapopulation capacity of the landscape and a threshold value determined by the properties of the species, and the characteristic turnover rate of the species, adjusted by a factor depending on the structure of the habitat patch network. Transient time is longest following a large perturbation, for a species which is close to the threshold for persistence, for a species with slow turnover, and in a habitat patch network consisting of only a few dynamically important patches. We demonstrate that the essential behaviour of the n-dimensional spatially realistic Levins model is captured by the one-dimensional Levins model with appropriate parameter transformations. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).},

	abstract = {Evenness indices provide a simple measure of community structure. It might therefore be possible to use them to identify the process by which a community has been assembled. To test whether this is practicable, we constructed simulated community samples using five stochastic models of community construction, proposed by Tokeshi. We then examined the ability of five evenness indices to identify the model under which the community samples were produced. Each model produced samples with a range of evenness values, but mean evenness differed between the models. The dominance decay (DD) model produced community samples with the greatest evenness, followed by MacArthur fraction (MF). Evenness was lowest under the dominance pre-emption (DP) model. The differences between models were quite consistent across indices and consistent between 5-species and 15-species communities. Samples produced under the DD and MF models varied least in evenness between 5-species and 15-species samples, and those produced under the random assortment (RA) model varied most, irrespective of the evenness index used. Evenness varied considerably between replicate samples, as expected with stochastic processes. In 5-species communities, the greatest robustness in evenness across replicates was seen using indices O or E′. In 15-species communities, O and EQ were the most robust. The index best able to identify the model which had generated the sample differed between models and with species richness. If the model of interest is not known in advance, the best index for identifying the generating model is Evar for communities of more than 10 species for RF, RA and DP models and O for other communities. The number of samples required in a data set before it could be effectively identified was, for example, more than 30 for 5-species samples produced under the random fraction (RF) model, and 3 for 15-species RF samples. In contrast, a 5-species DD data set could be effectively identified when it contained 15 or more samples. We conclude that evenness can be used to identify the process by which the community has been constructed, out of the five models considered here. The best evenness index for doing this varies with the species richness and the evenness of the community but we can suggest the use of O without knowing the model because its the more stable one against species richness and the more robust and unbiased against simulated samples and it encompass a good discriminating power between the models in most of the cases studied. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).},

	abstract = {We develop fractional allocation models and confidence statistics for parentage analysis in mating systems. The models can be used, for example, to estimate the paternities of candidate males when the genetic mother is known or to calculate the parentage of candidate parent pairs when neither is known. The models do not require two implicit assumptions made by previous models, assumptions that are potentially erroneous. First, we provide formulas to calculate the expected parentage, as opposed to using a maximum likelihood algorithm to calculate the most likely parentage. The expected parentage is superior as it does not assume a symmetrical probability distribution of parentage and therefore, unlike the most likely parentage, will be unbiased. Second, we provide a mathematical framework for incorporating additional biological data to estimate the prior probability distribution of parentage. This additional biological data might include behavioral observations during mating or morphological measurements known to correlate with parentage. The value of multiple sources of information is increased accuracy of the estimates. We show that when the prior probability of parentage is known, and the expected parentage is calculated, fractional allocation provides unbiased estimates of the variance in reproductive success, thereby correcting a problem that has previously plagued parentage analyses. We also develop formulas to calculate the confidence interval in the parentage estimates, thus enabling the assessment of precision. These confidence statistics have not previously been available for fractional models. We demonstrate our models with several biological examples based on data from two fish species that we study, coho salmon (Oncorhychus kisutch) and bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus). In coho, multiple males compete to fertilize a single female's eggs. We show how behavioral observations taken during spawning can be combined with genetic data to provide an accurate calculation of each male's paternity. In bluegill, multiple males and multiple females may mate in a single nest. For a nest, we calculate the fertilization success and the 95% confidence interval of each candidate parent pair. © 2OO1 Academic Press.},

When the background heritability H (i.e., residual correlation) among sibs for the disease in question is high, the power of multiplex affected sibships versus singletons is diminished compared with the situation when background heritability is low. Thus, multiplex families for association studies are most advantageous for low heritability disorders. Estimates of genotype relative risk (GRR) are also distorted in multiplex sibships compared with singletons based on background heritability. In a case-control study, GRR is inflated in multiplex families, with the degree of inflation decreasing with background heritability. By contrast, in a TDT (parental control) study, GRR is deflated in multiplex families, with the degree of deflation increasing with background heritability (and no deflation when H is 0).

Migration can cause global fixation even if, without migration, there is a globally attracting multiallelic equilibrium in every colony. Migration can also cause the global fixation of an allele that, without migration, is eliminated in every colony. Without dominance, generically, the number of alleles present at equilibrium cannot exceed the number of colonies. Some general properties and examples of the Levene model are studied in detail. If in each colony there is either no dominance or, without migration, a globally attracting internal equilibrium, then there exists a globally attracting equilibrium with migration.

But population structure can invalidate this approach, leading to apparent associations at markers that are unlinked to disease loci. Family-based tests of association can avoid this problem, but such studies are often more expensive and in some cases - particularly for late-onset diseases - are impractical. In this review article we describe a series of approaches published over the past 2 years which use multilocus genotype data to enable valid case-control tests of association, even in the presence of population structure. These tests can be classified into two categories. "Genomic control" methods use the independent marker loci to adjust the distribution of a standard test statistic, while "structured association" methods infer the details of population structure en route to testing for association. We discuss the statistical issues involved in the different approaches and present results from simulations comparing the relative performance of the methods under a range of models. © 2001 Elsevier Science.},

	abstract = {During the past decade, mutations affecting liability to human disease have been discovered at a phenomenal rate, and that rate is increasing. For the most part, however, those diseases have a relatively simple genetic basis. For diseases with a complex genetic and environmental basis, new approaches are needed to pave the way for more rapid discovery of genes affecting liability. One such approach exploits large, population-based samples and large-scale genotyping to evaluate disease/gene associations. A substantial drawback to such samples is the fact that population heterogeneity can induce spurious associations between genes and disease. We describe a method called genomic control (GC), which obviates many of the concerns about population substructure by using the features of the genomes present in the sample to correct for stratification. Two such approaches are now available. The GC approach exploits the fact that population substructure generate "overdispersion" of statistics used to assess association. By testing multiple polymorphisms throughout the genome, only some of which are pertinent to the disease of interest, the degree of overdispersion generated by population substructure can be estimated and taken into account. The other approach, called Structured Association (SA), assumes that the sampled population, while heterogeneous, is composed of subpopulations that are themselves homogeneous. By using multiple polymorphisms throughout the genome, SA probabilistically assigns sampled individuals to these latent subpopulations. We review in detail the overdispersion GC. In addition to outlining the published ideas on this method, we describe several extensions: quantitative trait studies and case-control studies with haplotypes and multiallelic markers. For each study design our goal is to achieve control similar to that obtained for a family-based study, but with the convenience found in a population-based design. © 2001 Elsevier Science.},

	abstract = {The concept of marine reserves as a method of improving management of fisheries is gaining momentum. While the list of benefits from reserves is frequently promoted, precise formulations of theory to support reserve design are not fully developed. To determine the size of reserves and the distances between reserves an understanding of the requirements for persistence of local populations is required. Unfortunately, conditions for persistence are poorly characterized, as are the larval dispersal patterns on which persistence depends. With the current paucity of information regarding meroplanktonic larval transport processes, understanding the robustness of theoretical results to larval dispersal is of key importance. From this formulation a broad range of dispersal patterns are analyzed. Larval dispersal is represented by a probability distribution that defines the fraction of successful settlers from an arbitrary location, the origin of the distribution, to any other location along the coast. While the effects of specific dispersal patterns have been investigated for invasion processes, critical habitat size and persistence issues have generally been addressed with only one or two dispersal types. To that end, we formulate models based on integrodifference equations that are spatially continuous and temporally discrete. We consider a range of dispersal distributions from leptokurtic to platykurtic. The effect of different dispersal patterns is considered for a single isolated reserve of varying size receiving no external larvae, as well as multiple reserves with varying degrees of connectivity. While different patterns result in quantitative differences in persistence, qualitatively similar effects across all patterns are seen in both single- and multiple reserve models. Persistence in an isolated reserve requires a size that is approximately twice the mean dispersal distance and regardless of the dispersal pattern the population in a patch is not persistent if the reserve size is reduced to just the mean dispersal distance. With an idealized coastline structure consisting of an infinite line of equally spaced reserves separated by regions of coastline in which reproduction is nil, the relative settlement as a function of the fraction of coastline and size of reserve is qualitatively very similar over a broad range of dispersal patterns. The upper limit for the minimum fraction of coastline held in reserve is about 40%. As the fraction of coastline is reduced, the minimum size of reserve becomes no more than 1.25 times the mean dispersal distance. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).},

Here, we present three deterministic binning methods and study the errors due to binning for a metapopulation model. Our results indicate that estimation errors of the investigated methods are not consistent and one cannot make generalizations about the quality of a method. For some compared output variables of populations studied, binning methods that caused a strong reduction in dimensionality of matrices resulted in better estimations than methods that produced a weaker reduction. The main problem with deterministic binning methods is that they do not properly take into account the stochastic population process itself.

For a battery of tightly linked anonymous genetic markers spanning a candidate region centered around a disease locus, simulation methods based on a coalescent process with mutation, recombination, and genetic drift were used to study the spatial distribution of markers with large noncentrality parameters in a case-control study design. Simulations with a disease allele at intermediate frequency, presumably representing an old mutation, tend to exhibit the largest noncentrality parameter values at markers near the disease locus. In contrast, simulations with a disease allele at low frequency, presumably representing a young mutation, often exhibit the largest noncentrality parameter values at markers scattered over the candidate region. In the former case, sample sizes or marker densities sufficient to detect association are likely to lead to useful localization, whereas, in the latter case, localization of the disease locus within the candidate region is much less likely, regardless of the sample size or density of the map. The simulations suggest that for a single marker analysis, the simple strategy of choosing the marker with smallest associated P value to begin a laboratory search for the disease locus performs adequately for a common disease allele. © 2001 Elsevier Science.},

	abstract = {I analyze the dynamics of predator and prey populations living in two patches. Within a patch the prey grow logistically and the predators have a Holling type II functional response. The two patches are coupled through predator migration. The system can be interpreted as a simple predator-prey metapopulation or as a spatially explicit predator-prey system. Asynchronous local dynamics are presumed by metapopulation theory. The main question I address is when synchronous and when asynchronous dynamics arise. Contrary to biological intuition, for very small migration rates the oscillations always synchronize. For intermediate migration rates the synchronous oscillations are unstable and I found periodic, quasi-periodic, and intermittently chaotic attractors with asynchronous dynamics. For large predator migration rates, attractors in the form of equilibria or limit cycles exist in which one of the patches contains no prey. The dynamical behavior of the system is described using bifurcation diagrams. The model shows that spatial predator-prey populations can be regulated through the interplay of local dynamics and migration. © 2001 Academic Press.},

	abstract = {The evolutionary dynamics of neutral alleles under the Wright-Fisher model are well understood. Similarly, the effect of population turnover on neutral genetic diversity in a metapopulation has attracted recent attention in theoretical studies. Here we present the results of computer simulations of a simple model that considers the effects of finite population size and metapopulation dynamics on a mating-system polymorphism involving selfing and outcrossing morphs. The details of the model are based on empirical data from dimorphic populations of the annual plant Eichhornia paniculata, but the results are also of relevance to species with density-dependent selfing rates in general. In our model, the prior selfing rate is determined by two alleles segregating at a single diploid locus. After prior selfing occurs, some remaining ovules are selfed through competing self-fertilisation in finite populations as a result of random mating among gametes. Fitness differences between the mating-system morphs were determined by inbreeding depression and pollen discounting in a context-dependent manner. Simulation results showed evidence of frequency dependence in the action of pollen discounting and inbreeding depression in finite populations. In particular, as a result of selfing in outcrossers through random mating among gametes, selfers experienced a "fixation bias" through drift, even when the mating-system locus was selectively neutral. In a metapopulation, high colony turnover generally favoured the fixation of the outcrossing morph, because inbreeding depression reduced opportunities for colony establishment by selfers through seed dispersal. Our results thus demonstrate that population size and metapopulation processes can lead to evolutionary dynamics involving pollen and seed dispersal that are not predicted for large populations with stable demography. © 2001 Academic Press.},

A sense of concordance for gene tree and species tree topologies is clarified, such that if the "collapsed gene tree" produced by a gene tree has the same topology as the species tree, the gene tree is said to be topologically concordant with the species tree. The term speciodendric is introduced to refer to genes whose trees are topologically concordant with species trees. For a given three-species topology, probabilities of each of the three possible collapsed gene tree topologies are given, as are probabilities of monophyletic concordance and concordance in the sense of N. Takahata (1989), Genetics 122, 957-966. Increasing the sample size is found to increase the probability of topological concordance, but a limit exists on how much the topological concordance probability can be increased.

This paper essentially upgrades the previous formulations of the portfolio effect, first developed by Doak and collaborators and then by Tilman. It uses a theoretical approach based on simple statistical relationships and some simplifying assumptions proposed by these authors. The new formulation presented extends and improves the previous relationships in the sense that it takes into account simultaneously a varying scaling power of the variance, the interaction effect between species, the heterogeneity in species productivity and interspecies correlated responses to the environment. It appears that the simple statistical averaging, as inferred from this formulation, does not necessarily lead to a positive correlation between species diversity and community stability. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).},

We derive the expectation of the proportion of mutants in the culture for arbitrary cell-cycle time distributions. We then introduce a two-parameter generalization of the continuum Luria-Delbrück distribution for two of the more commonly used cell-cycle time distributions: gamma and shifted exponential. We obtain the generalized distribution by defining a map from the actual parameters to "effective" parameters. The effective mutation rate is obtained analytically, while the effective population size is obtained by fitting simulation data. Our simulations show that the second parameter depend mostly on the coefficient of variation of the cell-cycle time distribution. © 2001 Academic Press.},

Since intraspecific competition induces disruptive selection, this model leads to a conflict of selective forces. We study how the underlying genetics (recombination rate and allelic effects) interacts with the selective forces, and explore the resulting equilibrium structure. For the special case of equal effects, global stability results are proved. Unless the locus effects are sufficiently different, the genetic variance maintained at equilibrium displays a threshold-like dependence on the strength of competition. For loci with equal effects, the equilibrium fitnesses of genotypic values exhibit disruptive selection if and only if competition is strong enough to maintain a stable two-locus polymorphism. For unequal effects, disruptive selection can be observed for weaker competition and in the absence of a stable polymorphism. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).},

Whether an individual is born susceptible or resistant to disease depends on the local population levels at the start of each generation. In particular, we are interested in the case where the fraction of resistant individuals in the population increases as the total population increases. This may be seen as a positive feedback mechanism since disease is the only population control imposed upon the system. Moreover, it reflects recent experimental observations from noctuid moth-baculovirus interactions that pathogen resistance may increase with larval density. We find that the inclusion of a resistant class can stabilise unstable host-pathogen interactions but there is greatest regulation when the fraction born resistant is density independent. Nonetheless, inclusion of density dependence can still allow intrinsically unstable host-pathogen dynamics to be stabilised provided that this effect is sufficiently small. Moreover, inclusion of density-dependent resistance to disease allows the system to give rise to bistable dynamics in which the final outcome is dictated by the initial conditions for the model system. This has implications for the management of agricultural pests using biocontrol agents in particular, it is suggested that the propensity for density-dependent resistance be determined prior to such a biocontrol attempt in order to be sure that this will result in the prevention of pest outbreaks, rather than their facilitation. Finally we consider how the cost of resistance to disease affects model outcomes and discover that when there is no cost to resistance, the model predicts stable periodic outbreaks of the insect population. The results are interpreted ecologically and future avenues for research to address the shortfalls in the present model system are discussed.},

	abstract = {The resistance of an ecosystem to perturbations and the speed at which it recovers after the perturbations, which is called resilience, are two important components of ecosystem stability. It has been suggested that biodiversity increases the resilience and resistance of aggregated ecosystem processes. We test this hypothesis using a theoretical model of a nutrient-limited ecosystem in a heterogeneous environment. We investigate the stability properties of the model for its simplest possible configuration, i.e., a system consisting of two plant species and their associated detritus and local resource depletion zones. Phenotypic diversity within the plant community is described by differences in the nutrient uptake and mortality rates of the two species. The usual measure of resilience characterizes the system as a whole and thus also applies to aggregated ecosystem processes. As a rule this decreases with increased diversity, though under certain conditions it is maximum for an intermediate value of diversity. Resistance is a property that characterizes each system component and process separately. The resistance of the inorganic nutrient pools, hence of nutrient retention in the ecosystem, decreases with increased diversity. The resistance of both total plant biomass and productivity either monotonically decreases or increases over part of the parameter range with increased diversity. Furthermore, it is very sensitive to parameter values. These results support the view that there is no simple relationship between diversity and stability in equilibrium deterministic systems, whether at the level of populations or aggregated ecosystem processes. We discuss these results in relation to recent experiments.},

	abstract = {This paper analyzes a consumer's adaptive feeding response to environmental gradients. We consider a consumer-resource system where resources are distributed among many discrete resource patches. Each consumer exhibits a feeding morphology allowing it to remove resources from a patch down to some threshold density (or level) before having to seek resources elsewhere. Assuming consumers trade off resource extraction with patch access and predation, we show that for a given environment there often exists a single evolutionarily stable feeding threshold and it is an evolutionary attractor. We then investigate how the population dynamics of the resource and the consumer change as the environment changes. Two cases are considered: (i) all consumers exhibit a fixed feeding threshold that is adaptive for an intermediate environment; and (ii) the consumer population adapts and adopts the evolutionarily stable feeding threshold associated with the current environment. In less harsh environments (i.e., environments where consumers experience a lower risk of predation, or environments where resource patches are more abundant) the adaptive consumer population is predicted to evolve so that resources within a patch are depleted to lower densities. We show that the change in consumer density due to environmental change can be rather different depending on whether or not the population can adapt. In some situations we observe that when the consumer's environment becomes harsher, the consumer population may increase in density before a rapid crash to extinction. This result has implications for monitoring and managing a population. (C) 2000 Academic Press.},

The parasitoid is assumed to experience a trade-off in its ability to exploit the two hosts. Three alternative types of parasitoid are investigated: (i) fixed generalists whose consumption rates are those that maximize fitness; (ii) 'ideal free' parasitoids, which modify their behavior to maximize their rate of finding unparasitized hosts within a generation; and (iii) 'evolving' parasitoids, whose capture rates change between generations based on quantitative genetic determination of the relative attack rates on the two hosts. The primary questions addressed are: (1) Do the different types of adaptive processes stabilize or destabilize the population dynamics? (2) Do the adaptive processes tend to equalize or to magnify differences in host densities? The models show that adaptive behavior and evolution frequently destabilize population dynamics and frequently increase the average difference between host densities.},

The effects of population management on both mean population persistence time and management cost were analyzed theoretically using a diffusion process. The model showed the functional forms of both mean persistence time and control frequency explicitly; these decreased with an increasing number of individuals removed from the population in each control operation. Based on the analysis, indices representing management costs are proposed. Mean persistence time is generally an increasing function of the cost indices. Nevertheless, if the cost of each control increases with the number of individuals removed, even the most conservative management practice (continuous control) may not be overly expensive.

Vertical transmission, defined as the direct transfer of infection from a parent organism to its progeny, has been suggested as a key factor causing reduction of symbiont virulence and evolution of mutualism. On the other hand, there are several mutualistic associations without vertical transmission, such as those between plants and mycorrhizal fungi, legumes and rhizobia, and some corals and dinoflagellates. It is expected that all mutualisms evolve perfect vertical transmission if the relationship is really mutualistic, because hosts may fail to acquire symbionts if they do not transmit the symbionts by vertical transmission. We have developed a mathematical model to clarify the conditions under which mutualistic symbiosis without vertical transmission should evolve. The evolution may occur when and only when (i) vertical transmission involves some costs in the host, (ii) the symbiont suffers direct negative effects if it exploits the host too intensively, (iii) the host establishes the ability to make use of waste products from the symbiont, and (iv) the mechanism of vertical transmission is controlled by the host. We also clarify the conditions under which mutualistic symbiosis with vertical transmission evolves.},

In the Ohta domain, the rate of substitution decreases with increasing population size; in the Kimura domain, the rate of substitution remains close to the mutation rate; in the Darwin domain, the rate of substitution increases without bound. In the Kimura and Darwin domains, the rate of substitution is much less sensitive to the population size than suggested by two-allele theories. Remarkably, the overdominance model converges to the neutral model with increasing N. The variation at a neutral locus linked to a selected locus is found to be insensitive to the population size for certain models of selection. A selected locus can actually cause the rate of substitution of deleterious alleles at a linked locus to increase with increasing population size. These unexpected results illustrate that intuition based on two-allele theory is often misleading.},

Using a diploid, one-locus model of a discrete-generation sink population maintained by immigration from a fixed source population, we show that a locally favored allele will spread when rare in the sink if the absolute fitness (or, in some cases, the geometric-mean absolute fitness) of heterozygotes with the favored allele is above one in the sink habitat. With density dependence, the criterion for spread can depend on the rate of immigration, because immigration affects local densities and, hence, absolute fitness. Given the successful establishment of a locally favored allele, it will be maintained by a migration-selection balance and the resulting polymorphic population will be sustained deterministically with either stable or unstable dynamics. The densities of stable polymorphic populations tend to exceed densities that would be maintained in the absence of the favored allele. With strong density regulation, spread of the favored allele may destabilize population dynamics. Our analyses show that polymorphic populations which form subsequent to the establishment of favorable alleles have the capacity to persist deterministically without immigration. Finally, we examined the probabilistic rate at which new favored alleles arise and become established in a sink population. Our results suggest that favored alleles are established most readily at intermediate levels of immigration.},

In each patch population dynamics is described by the Lotka-Volterra time continuous model. The refuge is characterized by its protectiveness which is inversely related to the predation risk for prey, and the dependence of population dynamics on protectiveness is studied. It is shown that adaptive behavior of prey changes qualitative properties of the underlying Lotka-Volterra model due to the appearance of a bounded attractor. Adaptive prey behavior does not lead to a stable equilibrium but to the reduction of population fluctuations. Dynamic consequences of a limited carrying capacity of the refuge are also considered. Low refuge carrying capacity leads to stability of predator-prey dynamics while stability is lost when the carrying capacity of the refuge is high. Lastly, it is shown that optimal antipredator behavior of prey leads to persistence and reduction of oscillations in population densities.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates the local dynamical behaviour of a deterministic model describing two host species experiencing three forms of competition: direct competition, apparent competition mediated by macroparasites, and intra-specific (density-dependent) competition. The problem of algebraic intractability is sidestepped by adopting a geometric approach, in which an array of maps is constructed in parameter space, each structured by bifurcation surfaces which mark qualitative changes in system behaviour. The maps provide both a succinct and a comprehensive overview of the stability and feasibility structure of the system equilibria, from which can be deduced the possible modes of local dynamical behaviour. A detailed examination of these maps shows that (i) the system is highly sensitive to the effect of infection on fecundity with synchronous sustained cycles readily generated by Hopf bifurcations; (ii) for a broad range of parameter values, pertinent to actual biological systems, apparent competition mediated by macroparasites is sufficient, on its own, to explain host exclusion; (iii) direct competition reinforces parasite-mediated competition to expand the host exclusion region; and (iv) the condition for host exclusion can be expressed simply in a form which holds for both micro- and macroparasite models and which involves just two key indices, measuring tolerance to the infection and the strength of direct competition. The techniques used in this paper are not restricted to the analysis of host-parasite systems but can be applied to a wide range of nonlinear population models. They are therefore as relevant to the analysis of such general issues as exploitative competition and trophic interactions as they are to specific epidemiological problems. (C) 2000 Academic Press.},

	abstract = {In this paper we consider one-predator-two-prey population dynamics described by a control system. We study and compare conditions for permanence of the system for three types of predator feeding behaviors: (i) specialized feeding on the more profitable prey type, (ii) generalized feeding on both prey types, and (iii) optimal foraging behavior. We show that the region of parameter space leading to permanence for optimal foraging behavior is smaller than that for specialized behavior, but larger than that for generalized behavior. This suggests that optimal foraging behavior of predators may promote coexistence in predator-prey systems. We also study the effects of the above three feeding behaviors on apparent competition between the two prey types.},

It explicitly or implicitly underlies many models of biodiversity of competing species, as well as non-spatial or metapopulation models of persistence of individual species. The model has also been used to study persistence in simple disease models. The stochastic logistic model has direct relevance for questions of limiting similarity in ecological systems. This paper uses a biased random walk heuristic to derive a scaling relationship for the persistence of a population under this model, and discusses its implications for models of biodiversity and persistence. Time to extinction of a species under the stochastic logistic model is approximated by the exponential of the scaling quantity U = (R - 1)2 N/R(R + 1), where N is the habitat size and R is the basic reproductive number.

	abstract = {How rapidly does an arbitrary pattern of statistical association among a set of loci decay under meiosis and random union of gametes? This problem is non-trivial, even in the case of an infinitely large population where selection and other forces are absent. J. H. Bennett (1954, Ann. Hum. Genet. 18, 311-317) found that, for an arbitrary number of loci with an arbitrary linkage map, it is possible to define measures of linkage disequilibrium that decay geometrically with time. He found a recursive method for deriving expressions for these variables in terms of 'allelic moments' (the factorial moments about the origin of the 'allelic indicators'), and expressions for the allelic moments in terms of his new variables. However, Bennett no where stated his recursive algorithm explicitly, nor did he give a general formula for his measures of linkage disequilibrium, for an arbitrary number of loci. Recursive definitions of Bennett's variables were obtained by Lyubich. However, the expressions generated by these recursions are not the same as those found by Bennett. (They do not express Bennett's variables as functions of the allelic moments.) Lyubich's derivations employ genetic algebras. Here, I present a method for obtaining explicit expressions for Bennett's variables in terms of the allelic moments. I show that the transformation from the allelic moments to Bennett's variables and the inverse transformation always have the form that Bennett claimed. (This transformation and its inverse have essentially the same form.) I present general recursions for calculating the coefficients in the forward transformation and the coefficients in the inverse transformation. My derivations involve combinatorial arguments and ordinary algebra only. The special case of unlinked loci is briefly discussed. (C) 2000 Academic Press.},

	abstract = {An important biological feature of cyclic populations of voles and lemmings is phase-related changes in average body mass, with adults in high-density phases being 20-30% heavier than those in low-density phases of a cycle. This observation, called the 'Chitty effect,' is considered to be a ubiquitous feature of cyclic populations. It has been argued that understanding the Chitty effect is fundamental to unraveling the enigma of population cycles. However, there exists no agreement among biologists regarding the causes of the Chitty effect. Here, I propose a simple hypothesis to explain the Chitty effect, based on phase-related, dynamic allocation of energy between reproductive and somatic effort. The essence of the hypothesis is that: (1) reproduction is suppressed in animals born or raised in the later part of the increase phase by environmental factors, including social influences; (2) suppression of reproduction limits the amount of energy that is diverted for reproductive effort, and forces a disproportionately greater amount of surplus power (the energy left after the energetic costs of standard and active metabolism are met) to be allocated for somatic effort; (3) the surplus energy, above and beyond what is required for routine biological activities, will allow continuous growth and deposition of additional body mass, which causes an increase in body mass; and (4) animals grow to a larger size as a population enters the peak density phase, causing an increase in the average body mass. The Chitty effect is predicted to be most pronounced at the late increase or peak phase of a population cycle. Possible causes of reproductive suppression include direct or indirect influences of the environmental factors. The Chitty effect may be a consequence, not a cause, of population cycles in small mammals.},

	abstract = {A new method is presented for analysing the dynamics of a classical model where infinitesimally rare alleles segregate at an infinite number of unlinked loci, and where the alleles at different loci have equivalent effects. The dynamics of the distribution of the number of rare alleles per individual (the 'phenotypic distribution') can be followed without knowing the frequencies of individual genotypes. Meiosis and random union of gametes have a very simple effect on the factorial cumulants of the phenotypic distribution which are consequently the natural set of variables to follow. An exact solution is presented for the dynamics of rare alleles under mutation and multiplicative selection. This solution has a simple representation in terms of the factorial cumulants. Unlike the QLE (quasi-linkage equilibrium) solution, this solution applies even when the population is far from linkage equilibrium. This approach is extended to analyse the joint dynamics of infinitesimally rare alleles at an infinite number of unlinked loci, together with a locus (with arbitrary allele frequencies) with which they interact. This more general method is used to investigate (1) the joint dynamics of a modifier of the mutation rate, together with deleterious alleles under mutation and multiplicative selection, and (2) the fate of an allele that ameliorates or exacerbates the fitness effects of deleterious alleles. When a new modifier allele causes a large change in the mutation rate, strong linkage disequilibrium is generated during its progress. However, using this new approach based on factorial cumulants, it is found that a remarkably simple invasion condition applies to alleles at the modifier locus, even when strong linkage disequilibrium is generated.},

The prevalence information at different time-age points is used to generate a surface; the time-age variations along the life line profiles of this surface and the difference in mortality rates are used to reconstruct the time and age dependence of the incidence rate. Past attempts were based on specified parametric forms for the incidence or on the hypothesis of time-invariant forms for the age-prevalence cross sections. The proposed method makes no such assumptions and is thus capable of coping with rapidly evolving prevalence situations. In the simulations carried out, it is found to be resilient to important random noise components added to a prescribed incidence rate input. The method is also tested on a real data set of successive HIV age-prevalence cross sections from Burundi coupled to differential mortality data on HIV+ and HIV- individuals. The often-made assumption that the incidence rate can be written as the product of a calendar time component and an age component is also examined. In this case, a pooling procedure is proposed to estimate the time and the age profiles of the incidence rate using the reconstructed incidence rates at all time-age points.},

	abstract = {In order to predict extinction risk in the presence of reddened, or correlated, environmental variability, fluctuating parameters may be represented by the family of 1/f noises, a series of stochastic models with different levels of variation acting on different timescales. We compare the process of parameter estimation for three 1/f models (white, pink and brown noise) with each other, and with autoregressive noise models (which are not 1/f noises), using data from a model time-series (length, T) of population. We then calculate the expected increase in variance and the expected extinction risk for each model, and we use these to explore the implication of assuming an incorrect noise model. When parameterising these models, it is necessary to do so in terms of the measured ('sample') parameters rather than fundamental ('population') parameters. This is because these models are non-stationary: their parameters need not stabilize on measurement over long periods of time and are uniquely defined only over a specified 'window' of timescales defined by a measurement process. We find that extinction forecasts can differ greatly between models, depending on the length, T, and the coefficient of variability, CV, of the time series used to parameterise the models, and on the length of time into the future which is to be projected. For the simplest possible models, ones with population itself the 1/f noise process, it is possible to predict the extinction risk based on CV of the observed time series. Our predictions, based on explicit formulae and on simulations, indicate that (a) for very short projection times relative to T, brown and pink noise models are usually optimistic relative to equivalent white noise model; (b) for projection timescales equal to and substantially greater than T, an equivalent brown or pink noise model usually predicts a greater extinction risk, unless CV is very large; and (c) except for very small values of CV, for timescales very much greater than T, the brown and pink models present a more optimistic picture than the white noise model. In most cases, a pink noise is intermediate between white and brown models. Thus, while reddening of environmental noise may increase the long-term extinction probability for stationary processes, this is not generally true for non-stationary processes, such as pink or brown noises.},

Furthermore, the model conveniently allows investigation into the robustness of these population outbreaks under the influence of density-dependent dispersal behavior. We find that localized population outbreaks in space can still occur with modest amounts of pursuit and aggregative behavior by parasitoids. We end by showing that evidence from a real host-parasitoid system is consistent with the predictions of the model. (C) 2000 Academic Press.},

The estimators are due to Weir and Cockerham (θ(WC)) and to Robertson and Hill (θ(RH)), respectively. Both estimators are linear combinations of biallelic estimators which differ in the way frequent and rare alleles are weighted. Consequently, their sampling properties differ as far as bias and variance are concerned. In the infinite island model at migration-drift equilibrium, in the case of one multiallelic locus, we analytically approximate the bias of the two estimators and show that θ(WC) is nearly unbiased, whereas θ(RH) is negatively biased. Hence, we propose a correction of bias of the latter. Moreover, we reexamine the properties of variance of the initial estimators: due to their construction, their variances are minimal, each over different parameter ranges, θ(RH) performing better for low differentiation and θ(WC) for high differentiation. These theoretical properties are confirmed by simulations, which show that our correction of bias of θ(RH) performs well and does not affect its property of minimal variance for low differentiation. Hence, we advocate the use of θ(WC) for high values of differentiation, and the use of θ(RH), with our correction of bias, for low or moderate differentiation. (C) 2000 Academic Press.},

All haploid genotypes with the same number of 1 alleles can then remain equally frequent.

Here, we show how the 2'' x 2'' stability matrix can be decomposed into a set of matrices, each no larger than n x n. This allows the stability of symmetrical solutions to be determined.

	abstract = {Producing toxic chemicals to suppress both the growth and survivorship of local competitors is called allelopathy; some strains of the bacteria Escherichia coli produce a toxin (named colicin) which may kill colicin-sensitive neighbors while they themselves are immune. In a previous paper, the competitive outcome between colicin-producing and colicin-sensitive strains was shown to differ between a spatially structured and a completely mixed population. In this paper, we analyze the role of a third, 'colicin-immune,' strain, which does not produce colicin but is immune to it. Without spatial structure, the colicin-immune strain suppresses the colicin-producing strain and enables the colicin-sensitive strain to win. In a spatially structured population, modeled as a reaction-diffusion system, we examine the speed of boundaries between areas dominated by different strains in traveling waves and the events after the collision of two such boundaries. The colicin-immune strain passes through the area dominated by the colicin-sensitive strain and drives the colicin-producing strain to extinction. Subsequently the colicin-sensitive strain occupies the whole population. (C) 2000 Academic Press.},

	abstract = {Previous work has demonstrated that for games defined by differential or difference equations with a continuum of strategies, there exists a G-function, related to individual fitness, that must take on a maximum with respect to a virtual variable v whenever v is one of the vectors in the coalition of vectors which make up the evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS). This result, called the ESS maximum principle, is quite useful in determining candidates for an ESS. This principle is reformulated here, so that it may be conveniently applied to matrix games. In particular, we define a matrix game to be one in which fitness is expressed in terms of strategy frequencies and a matrix of expected payoffs. It is shown that the G-function in the matrix game setting must again take on a maximum value at all the strategies which make up the ESS coalition vector. The reformulated maximum principle is applicable to both bilinear and nonlinear matrix games. One advantage in employing this principle to solve the traditional bilinear matrix game is that the same G-function is used to find both pure and mixed strategy solutions by simply specifying an appropriate strategy space. Furthermore we show how the theory may be used to solve matrix games which are not in the usual bilinear form. We examine in detail two nonlinear matrix games: the game between relatives and the sex ratio game. In both of these games an ESS solution is determined. These examples not only illustrate the usefulness of this approach to finding solutions to an expanded class of matrix games, but aids in understanding the nature of the ESS as well. © 2000 Academic Press.},

A computational technique of Griffiths and Tavare used is a computer intensive Markov chain simulation, which simulates gene trees conditional on their topology implied by the mutation pattern in the sample of DNA sequences.

We proved that under certain conditions there exist stable equilibria with unequal population densities in the two patches, a situation which can be interpreted as conserved heterogeneity. Furthermore, the Allee effect can lead to instability of the equilibrium with equal population densities if some degree of competition is assumed to occur between the subpopulations (non-local competition). This indicates the potential of the Allee effect to create spatial heterogeneity. Neither of these effects appear under biologically realistic parameter values in a model where uniparental reproduction is assumed. We proved that both the between-patch migration intensity and the degree of non-local competition are decisive in determining boundaries between these types of behaviour of the spatial system with Allee effect. Therefore, we propose that the Allee effect, migration intensity, and non-local competition should be considered jointly in studies focusing on problems like pattern formation in space and invasions of spreading species.},

This results in a reduction of the fixation or coalescent time by division by this factor. Sex differences in this correlation have been observed, and this provides an explanation for the difference of coalescent times of y-chromosomes and mitochondria.},

	abstract = {In this paper we study optimal animal movement in heterogeneous environments consisting of several food patches in which animals trade-off energy gain versus predation risk. We derive a myopic optimization rule describing optimal animal movements by fitness maximization assuming an animal state is described by a single quantity (such as weight, size, or energy reserves). This rule predicts a critical state at which an animal should switch from a more dangerous and more profitable patch to a less dangerous and less profitable patch. Qualitatively, there are two types of behavior: either the animal switches from one patch to another and stays in the new patch for some time before it switches again, or the animal switches between two patches instantaneously. The former case happens if animal state growth is positive in all patches, while the latter case happens if animal state growth is negative in one patch. In particular, this happens if one patch is a refuge. We consider in detail two special cases. The first one assumes a linear animal state growth while the second assumes a saturating animal state growth described by the von Bertalanffy curve. For the first model the proportion of time spent in the more profitable and more risky patch increases with profitability of this patch when state growth is positive in both patches. On contrary, if state growth is negative in the less profitable and safer patch, animals spend proportionally less time in the more profitable and more risky patch as its profitability increases. As a function of the predation risk in the more profitable patch the time spent there proportionally decreases. When animal state growth is described by the saturating curve, time spent in the more risky patch is a hump-shaped curve if state growth is positive in both patches. Our results extend the μ/f rule, which predicts that animals should behave in such a way as to minimize mortality risk to resource intake ratio. © 2000 Academic Press.},

The system consisted of multiple habitats, each composed of a number of sites occupied by adults of two species. Larvae produced from different habitats were mixed in a common pool. When an adult died, the vacant site became occupied by an individual randomly chosen from the larval pool. If there were n habitats, there could be up to n-1 internal equilibria with both species in addition to two single-species equilibria. These equilibria and their local stability can be calculated from a single function, indicating the difference among species in their average lifetime reproductive success. Our main result is that between-habitat variation in the ratio of mortalities of two species promotes coexistence, while that of reproductive rates does not. This conclusion is the opposite of the role of temporal variation in the standard lottery model, in which between-year variation in the reproductive rate, but not that in the mortalities, promotes coexistence.

Ecol. 47, 219-247, 249-267) to several species of parasites that are assumed to interact only by causing the death of a common host. An exact invadability condition is found for this model. By studying when mutual invasibility is possible, the region where two parasite species can coexist is found. The result is that, if there is a trade-off between virulence and transmissibility, then coexistence of two species of parasites is possible, but only when the parameters of the model fall into a very narrow parameter region. If, on the other hand, one parasite is more virulent and less transmissible, then it will be competitively excluded. This latter result, though expected in terms of competition theory, is in contrast with what found in the approximate models so far used for studying interacting macroparasites. The effect of parasite aggregation on coexistence is studied by considering two modifications of the basic model (clumped infections and host population heterogeneity in predisposition to infections) that allow for higher aggregation. It appears that the width of the coexistence region is insensitive to these modifications. (C) 2000 Academic Press.},

	abstract = {This article explores effects of adaptive intraguild predation on species coexistence and community structure in three species food webs. Two Lotka-Volterra models that assume a trade-off between competition and predation strength are considered in detail. The first model does not explicitly model resource dynamics and is considered with both nonadaptive and adaptive intraguild predation; in the latter case predators choose their diet in order to maximize their instantaneous population growth rate. The second model includes resource population dynamics. Effects of adaptive intraguild predation on the community structure along a gradient in environment productivity are analyzed and compared with some experimental results of protist food webs. Conditions under which intraguild predation is adaptive are discussed for both models. It is proved that if intraguild predators are perfect optimizers then intraguild predation should decrease with increasing environmental productivity and adaptive intraguild predation is a stabilizing factor provided environmental productivity is high enough.

	abstract = {This paper investigates the possibility of understanding the effects of host heterogeneity on disease levels through the use of moment approximations. The approach is to avoid assumptions about the distribution of mixing rates (or other parameters) in the population, by treating the low-order moments of the distribution as estimable parameters. This approach, while approximate, can greatly reduce the number of parameters needed to explore the effects of population heterogeneity on disease dynamics. This makes the approach useful for both inference and prediction, and also for gaining insight into the qualitative effects of heterogeneity on the spread of disease. This paper focuses on populations with variations in mixing rate and random mixing. It is shown that moment-based approximations can provide good quantitative estimates of disease dynamics, as well as aiding in qualitative understanding, over a respectable range of parameters. It is hoped that this approach will provide a useful complement to more traditional box models of heterogeneity.},

	abstract = {We develop a cytonuclear framework for tetraploid populations in which a diallelic nuclear marker exhibits tetrasomic inheritance. This system requires two separate parameterizations, with six cytonuclear disequilibria (nonrandom associations) in tetraploid individuals and four in their diploid gametes. Double reduction during meiosis adds further complexity by causing gametic output to vary with the distance of the nuclear locus from the centromere. We derive and analyze dynamical solutions for the disequilibria under generalized mixed mating, with any combination of apomixis, selfing, and outcrossing, with and without double reduction. As in comparable diploid systems, all disequilibria ultimately decay to zero, unless nuclear and cytoplasmic alleles are nonrandomly associated and outcrossing is absent, in which case permanent associations result. Selfing and apomixis retard the decay of disequilibria (or approach to equilibrium), and often to the same extent. In contrast, double reduction can accelerate the loss of tetraploid cytonuclear associations, but only negligibly in hybrid zones, and this loss is never faster than in diploids. Only in the absence of allelic associations or outcrossing is the asymptotic approach to equilibrium differentially affected by apomixis and selfing or slower under tetrasomic than disomic inheritance. To facilitate empirical applications, we also examine tetraploid hybrid zone dynamics and offer practical guidelines for experimental design and data analysis, showing how the consequences of the mating system alone provide a valuable baseline for drawing evolutionary inferences from the observed patterns of cytonuclear associations.

We prove that this methodology produces the correct results for single-component models which are generalizations of the Fisher model, and then demonstrate by numerical experimentation that analogous methods work for a wide class of epidemic and invasion models including the S-I and S-E-I epidemic models and the Rosenzweig-McArthur predator-prey model. As examplary application of this approach we consider the atto-fox effect in the classic reaction-diffusion model of rabies in the European fox population and show that the appropriate threshold for this model is within an order of magnitude of the peak disease incidence and thus has potentially significant effects on epidemic properties. We then make a careful re-parameterisation of the model and show that the velocities calculated with realistic thresholds differ surprisingly little from those calculated from threshold-free models. We conclude that an appropriately thresholded reaction-diffusion model provides a robust representation of the initial epidemic wave and thus provides a sound basis on which to begin a properly mechanistic modelling enterprise aimed at understanding the long-term persistence of the disease.},

	abstract = {We consider systems with one predator and one prey, or a common predator and two prey species (apparent competitors) in source and sink habitats. In both models, the predator species is vulnerable to extinction, if productivity in the source is insufficient to rescue demographically deficient sink populations. Conversely, in the model with two prey species, if the source is too rich, one of the prey species may be driven extinct by apparent competition, since the predator can maintain a large population because of the alternative prey. Increasing the rate of predator movement from the source population has opposite effects on prey and predator persistence. High emigration rate exposes the predator population to danger of extinction, reducing the number of individuals that breed and produce offspring in the source habitat. This may promote coexistence of prey by relaxing predation pressure and apparent competition between the two prey species. The number of sinks and spatial arrangement of patches, or connectivity between patches, also influence persistence of the species. More sinks favor the prey and fewer sinks are advantageous to the predator. A linear pattern with the source at one end is profitable for the predator, and a centrifugal pattern in which the source is surrounded by sinks is advantageous to the prey. When the dispersal rate is low, effects of the spatial structure may exceed those of the number of sinks. In brief, productivity in patches and patterns of connectivity between patches differentially influence persistence of populations in different trophic levels.},

	abstract = {The governing equations are derived for the dynamics of a population consisting of organisms which reproduce by laying one egg at the time, on the basis of a simple physiological model for the uptake and use of energy. Two life stages are assumed, the egg and the adult stage where the adults do not grow. These assumptions hold true, for instance, for rotifers. From the model for the life history of the individuals, a physiologically structured population model for a rotifer population is derived. On the basis of this discrete event reproduction population model a continuous reproduction population model is proposed. The population model together with the equation for the food result in chemostat equations which are solved numerically. We show that for the calculation of the transient population dynamic behaviour after a step-wise change of the dilution rate, an age structure suffices, despite the size and energy structure used to describe the dynamics of the individuals. Aggregation of the continuous reproduction population model yields an approximate lumped parameter model in terms of delay differential equations. In order to assess the performance of the models, experimental data from the literature are fitted. The main purpose of this paper is to discuss the consequences of discrete event versus continuous reproduction. In both population models death by starvation is taken into account. Unlike the continuous reproduction model, the discrete model captures the experimentally observed lack of egg production shortly after the step change in the dilution rate of the chemostat.},

	abstract = {In this paper we show the density-dependent harvest rates of optimal Bayesian foragers exploiting prey occurring with clumped spatial distribution. Rodriguez-Girones and Vasquez (1997) recently treated the issue, but they used a patch-leaving rule (current value assessment rule) that is not optimal for the case described here. An optimal Bayesian forager exploiting prey whose distribution follows the negative binomial distribution should leave a patch when the potential (and not instantaneous) gain rate in that patch equals the best long-term gain rate in the environment (potential value assessment rule). It follows that the instantaneous gain rate at which the patches are abandoned is an increasing function of the time spent searching in the patch. It also follows that the proportion of prey harvested in a patch is an increasing sigmoidal function of the number of prey initially present. In this paper we vary several parameters of the model to evaluate the effects on the forager's intake rate, the proportion of prey harvested per patch, and the prey's average mortality rate in the environment. In each case, we study an intake rate maximizing forager's optimal response to the parameter changes. For the potential value assessment rule we find that at a higher average prey density in the environment, a lower proportion of the prey is taken in a patch with a given initial prey density. The proportion of prey taken in a patch of a given prey density also decreases when the variance of the prey density distribution is increased and if the travel time between patches is reduced. We also evaluate the effect of using predation minimization, rather than rate maximization, as the currency. Then a higher proportion of the prey is taken for each given initial prey density. This is related to the assumption that traveling between patches is the most risky activity. Compared to the optimal potential value assessment rule, the current value assessment rule performs worse, in terms of long-term intake rate achieved. The difference in performance is amplified when prey density is high or highly aggregated. These results pertain to the foraging patch spatial scale and may have consequences for the spatial distribution of prey in the environment. (C) 2000 Academic Press.},

After first deriving the time-dependent solutions for nonrandom associations (disequilibria) between a diallelic cytoplasmic marker and the alleles and genotypes at a diploid nuclear locus, we delimit all possible dynamical behaviors and the conditions under which each occurs. As in standard mixed mating systems, all disequilibria ultimately decay to zero except when outcrossing is absent, in which case permanent disequilibria result if the allelic association is initially nonzero. When at least some outcrossing is present, any initial allelic association decays at a constant geometric rate, whereas genotypic disequilibria may first increase in magnitude or change sign. Although selfing and apomixis tend to retard the decay of disequilibria (or approach to equilibrium) and often to the same extent, apomixis can have a stronger effect under some conditions. We also determine the dynamics of cytonuclear disequilibria in specific examples that may be of particular interest for empirical studies of hybrid zones. The results suggest several practicaL guidelines for experimental design and data analysis and show how the cytonuclear disequilibrium dynamics under mating system alone furnish a quantitative baseline for null hypotheses against which to test for the presence of other evolutionary forces.

However, many mechanisms can lead to predator dependence, and there is increasing evidence for the importance of this dependence. Identification of the mathematical form of the functional response from real data is therefore a challenging task. In this paper we apply model-fitting to test if typical ecological predator-prey time series data, which contain both observation error and process error, can give some information about the form of the functional response. Working with artificial data (for which the functional response is known) we will show that with moderate noise levels, identification of the model that generated the data is possible. However, the noise levels prevailing in real ecological time-series can give rise to wrong identifications. We will also discuss the quality of parameter estimation by fitting differential equations to such time-series. (C) 2000 Academic Press.},

	abstract = {Many 1-dimensional discrete time ecological models contain a sensitivity parameter that does not affect the dynamic complexity of these models. We show that genetic variability in this parameter can have a strong effect on population dynamics. We incorporate ecological dynamics in two different population genetic models with one locus and two alleles. The first is the classical model of a randomly mating population in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, and the second is a model of differential selection in males and females. In populations in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, variability in the sensitivity parameter can be maintained by overdominance. In this case, the dynamics of the polymorphic population tend to be much simpler than those of monomorphic populations. In the model with different selection in males and females, polymorphisms can be maintained in various ways, e.g., by opposing directional selection in males and females. Polymorphism in the sensitivity parameter tends to simplify population dynamics in the model with different selection in males and females as well. A number of interesting dynamic effects can be observed, e.g., multiple attractors with complicated basins of attraction. Then the final state of the system after a successful invasion by mutant alleles may depend on the mutation rate and on the distribution of mutational steps. In addition, there are situations in which genetic variability destabilizes a stable population dynamic equilibrium in the monomorphic model. There is an analogy between genetic variability and variability imposed by the environment. If differences in sensitivity are caused by the environment, dynamic effects similar to those in the genetic models can be observed. In addition, source-sink structures that are known to occur in spatially structured models can be seen in the genetic model if one of the genotypes is inviable. The results suggest that combining ecological and population genetic models can lead to a number of new insights. More work is needed, e.g., with fertility models, in which fitnesses are not assigned to individuals, but to mating pairs.},

The results show the uncertainty in model predictions that population growth will reduce over the next 20 years to approximately zero in parts of East Africa severely affected by the AIDS epidemic.

Diffusion is modeled passively and applied to a cellular grid of territories forming a coupled map lattice. Dispersal mortality is proportional to the amount of nonhabitat and fully occupied habitat surrounding a given cell, with distance decay. After verifying that our model produces the results expected for single patches of uniform habitat, we investigate heterogeneous and fragmented model landscapes. In heterogeneous single-patch systems near critical patch size, populations approach Gaussian spatial distributions with total population constrained by the capacity of the most limiting cell. In fragmented habitat landscapes, threshold effects are more complex and parametrically sensitive. The results from our experiments suggest the following: the ability to achieve persistence in hyperdispersed patchy habitats by adding similarly fragmented patches requires meeting threshold reproduction rates; persistent metapopulations in which no local population is individually persistent appear when dispersal distances and reproduction rates are both high, but only within narrow parameter ranges that are close to extinction thresholds; successful use of stepping-stone patches to support metapopulation systems appears unlikely for passively diffusing species; elongated patches offer early colonization advantages, but blocky patches offer greater population resilience near extinction thresholds. A common theme running through our findings is that population viability estimates may depend on our ability to determine when population and habitat systems are approaching extinction threshold conditions.},

	abstract = {LMC (local mate competition) was first introduced by W. D. Hamilton to explain extraordinary female-biased sex ratios observed in a variety of insects and mites. In the original model, the population is subdivided into an infinite number of colonies founded by a fixed number of inseminated females producing the same very large number of offspring. The male offspring compete within the colonies to inseminate the female offspring and then these disperse at random to found new colonies. An unbeatable sex ratio strategy is found to be female-biased. In this paper, the effects of having colonies of random size and foundresses producing a random finite number of offspring are considered. The exact evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) sex ratio is deduced and comparisons with previous approximate or numerical results are made. As the mean or the variance of brood size increases, the ESS sex ratio becomes more female-biased. An increase in the variance of colony size increases the ESS proportion of males when the mean brood size and colony size are both small, but decreases this proportion when the mean brood size or the mean colony size is large.},

These generalizations involve an interesting, dynamic version of Hamilton's Rule from inclusive fitness theory.

As has been demonstrated previously, if the intrinsic dynamics of local populations are unstable, then passive dispersal cannot stabilise. Extreme asymmetry in the dispersal fractions between the two species can, however, destabilise the metapopulation equilibrium state. Our key conclusion is that the precise effects of dispersal on stability depend critically on the underlying ecology of the interaction within each population. The presence of regulatory mechanisms, be they in the form of density-dependent host reproduction or the presence of host refugia, decreases the likelihood of observing dispersal-induced instabilities. Indeed, if the stabilising effects are sufficiently strong, then dispersal cannot be destabilising, no matter how asymmetric the dispersal fractions are. On the other hand, positive feedbacks arising from threshold effects in host reproduction or inversely density-dependent patterns of parasitism (due to, for example, long handling times or egg limitation) amplify the destabilising effects of dispersal.},

	abstract = {A general model of competitive and apparent competitive interactions in a spatially-variable environment is developed and analyzed to extend findings on coexistence in a temporally-variable environment to the spatial case and to elucidate new principles. In particular, coexistence mechanisms are divided into variation-dependent and variation-independent mechanisms with variation-dependent mechanisms including spatial generalizations of relative nonlinearity and the storage effect. Although directly analogous to the corresponding temporal mechanisms, these spatial mechanisms involve different life history traits which suggest that the spatial storage effect should arise more commonly than the temporal storage effect and spatial relative nonlinearity should arise less commonly than temporal relative nonlinearity. Additional mechanisms occur in the spatial case due to spatial covariance between the finite rate of increase of a local population and its local abundance, which has no clear temporal analogue. A limited analysis of these additional mechanisms shows that they have similar properties to the storage effect and relative nonlinearity and potentially may be considered as enlargements of the earlier mechanisms. The rate of increase of a species perturbed to low density is used to quantify coexistence. A general quadratic approximation, which is exact in some important cases, divides this rate of increase into contributions from the various mechanisms above and admits no other mechanisms, suggesting that opportunities for coexistence in a spatially-variable environment are fully characterized by these mechanisms within this general model. Three spatially-implicit models are analyzed as illustrations of the general findings and of techniques using small variance approximations. The contributions to coexistence of the various mechanisms are expressed in terms of simple interpretable formulae. These spatially-implicit models include a model of an annual plant community, a spatial multispecies version of the lottery model, and a multispecies model of an insect community competing for spatially-patchy and ephemeral food. © 2000 Academic Press.},

The (unconditional) cumulant functions for the transient and the equilibrium population size distributions are obtained, from which the distributions are shown to be near-normal at all times for the parameter values of interest. Approximating cumulant functions, which are relatively easy to find in practice, are derived and shown to be quite accurate, except for the case of massive immigration. As the level of immigration increases, the mean value rises more rapidly initially, as expected; however, the variance and the skewness of both the transient and the equilibrium distributions are reduced.},

Some simple models of environmental stochasticity are suggested, and we demonstrate a number of analytic approximations and simulation-based approaches that can usefully be applied to them. Initially, these techniques, including moment-closure approximations and local linearization, are explored in the context of a simple and relatively tractable process. Our presentation seeks to introduce these techniques to a broad-based audience of applied modellers. Therefore, as a test case, we study a natural stochastic formulation of a non-linear deterministic model for nematode infections in ruminants, proposed by Roberts and Grenfell (1991). This system is particularly suitable for our purposes, since it captures the essence of more complicated formulations of parasite demography and herd immunity found in the literature. We explore two modes of behaviour. In the endemic regime the stochastic dynamic fluctuates widely around the non-zero fixed points of the deterministic model. Enhancement of these fluctuations in the presence of environmental stochasticity can lead to extinction events. Using a simple model of environmental fluctuations we show that the magnitude of this system response reflects not only the variance of environmental noise, but also its autocorrelation structure. In the managed regime host-replacement is modelled via periodic perturbation of the population variables. In the absence of environmental variation stochastic effects are negligible, and we examine the system response to a realistic environmental perturbation based on the effect of micro-climatic fluctuations on the contact rate. The resultant stochastic effects and the relevance of analytic approximations based on simple models of environmental stochasticity are discussed. (C) 2000 Academic Press.},

If the evolution of seed size is mutation-limited and single mutations have only a small phenotypic effect, then an initially monomorphic population reaches the final evolutionarily stable polymorphic state through one or more discrete evolutionary branching events. At each such branching event, a given lineage already present in the population divides into two phenotypically diverging daughter lines, each with its own seed size. If the precompetitive survival of seeds and seedlings is high for small and large seeds alike, however, evolutionary branching may be followed by the extinction of one or more lineages.

We review them here in a unifying framework, which is the substitution process in continuous time. The emerging interpretation will also clarify the relationship among these distance measures. We also tackle situations with site-to-site variation of substitution rates which is well known to cause non-additive distances and inconsistent branch lengths. For homogeneous, stationary, time-reversible models, this may be repaired provided that the distribution of rates is known. In contrast, we will show that, for nonstationary models, different tree topologies may produce identical joint distributions of letters in pairs of sequences, given the same distribution of rates. This precludes the existence of any tree-additive pairwise distance measure.},

	abstract = {When a small number of individuals of a single species are confined in a closed space with a limited amount of indispensable resources, breeding may start initially under suitable conditions, and after peaking, the population should go extinct as the resources are exhausted. Starting with the logistic equation and assuming that the carrying capacity of the environment is a function of the amount of resources, a mathematical model describing such a pattern of population change is obtained. An application of this model to a typical set of population records, that of deer herds by V. B. Scheffer (1951, Sci. Monthly 73, 356-362) and E. C. O'Roke and F. N. Hamerstrom (1948, J. Wildlife Management 12, 78-86), yields estimates of the initial amount of indispensable food and its availability or nutritional efficiency which were previously unspecified.},

	abstract = {We use a dynamic random field to model a spatial collection of coupled oscillators with discrete time stochastic dynamics. At each time step the phase of each cyclic local population is subject to random noise, incremented by a common dynamic, and pulled by a coupling force in the direction of some collective mean phase. We define asynchrony and derive expressions for its measurement in this model. We describe robust methods for phase estimation of cyclic population time series, for estimating strength of coupling between local populations, and for measuring variance of locally acting noise from field data. Proposed methods allow intermittently acting phase synchronizing events operating over large spatial scales to be distinguished from more continuous and possibly locally acting coupling, both of which could result in elevated levels of phase synchronization. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by applying it to classical spatial time series data of Canadian lynx. Analysis confirms findings of previous studies and reveals evidence to suggest that interpopulation coupling was weaker over the 20th century than for the 1800s. Analysis supports the notion that synchrony in these populations is maintained by a continuous and locally acting coupling between adjacent regions with large phase adjustments occurring only infrequently. When this coupling is absent, asynchrony develops between populations. © 2000 Academic Press.},

The theory is developed for a generic model that takes into account two features characteristic of plant-parasite interactions: a dual source of inoculum (infection from primary or externally introduced inoculum and secondary infection from contact between susceptible and infected host tissue) and a host response to infection lead. Each of the threshold criteria is shown to be the sum of the individual components for primary and secondary infection. This indicates that if parasite invasion is not possible through primary or secondary infection alone, when the two modes of transmission are combined, the parasite may be able to invade. The invasion criteria demonstrate that there is a threshold population of susceptible hosts below which the parasite is unable to invade. If there are nonlinearities in the population dynamics (arising through either the transmission process or the host response), there are also threshold densities for the infected hosts and parasite populations below which invasion does not occur. The implications of the results for the control of plant disease are discussed. (C) 2000 Academic Press.},

	abstract = {Recent empirical studies have focused attention on the interplay in multi-host systems of parasite-mediated apparent competition and direct competition between hosts. However, theoretical investigation of such systems has been hindered by the onset of algebraic intractability with the increase in system dimensionality. In this paper we circumvent this problem by using a geometric approach in which arrays of bifurcation maps are constructed, each map being structured by the set of (bifurcation) points in parameter space at which qualitative changes in system behaviour take place. From these maps can be compiled a concise catalogue of the possible modes of system behaviour, enabling an investigation of the interaction of apparent and direct competitive forces to be carried out. Of importance is the identification of those situations where increasing one or both of these competitive forces leads to a change in the stability state. The maps provide an efficient way of determining whether, and, if so, under what conditions, specific modes of behaviour are allowed by the model. Two field phenomena of particular interest, discussed in the paper, are host invasion and dominance reversal resulting from the introduction of the pathogen into a directly competitive system.},

To this purpose, an individual-based model for a benthic population is developed that is both spatial and stochastic. With this model, three possible ways of approximating the dynamics of mean numbers are examined: a mean-field approximation that ignores space completely, a second-order approximation that represents spatial variation in terms of variances and covariances, and a patch-based approximation that retains information about the age structure of the patch population. Results show that space is important and that a temporal model relying on mean disturbance rates provides a poor approximation to the dynamics of mean numbers. It is possible, however, to represent relevant spatial variation with second-order moments, particularly when recruitment rates are low and/or when disturbances are large and weak. Even better approximations are obtained by retaining patch age information.},

We show that, for diploid hosts, sex ratio distortion may lead to extinction as males become too rare to maintain the host population through reproduction. Feminizers can magnify Allee effects, broadening the range of conditions leading to extinction of small populations. Depending on male mating constraints and strength of density dependence, feminizers may either increase or decrease the equilibrium host density. Under conditions leading to deterministic host extinction, stochastic elimination of the parasite may allow the host population to recover. Hence, infection by parasitic sex ratio distorters may be transient in finite populations. We consider the implications of this process for parasite prevalence, host population regulation, and sex ratio evolution.},

	abstract = {Following primary tuberculosis (TB) infection, only approximately 10% of individuals develop active T.B. Most people are assumed to mount an effective immune response to the initial infection that limits proliferation of the bacilli and leads to long-lasting partial immunity both to further infection and to reactivation of latent bacilli remaining from the original infection. Infected individuals may develop active TB as a consequence of exogenous reinfaction, i.e., acquiring a new infection from another infectious individual. Our results in this paper suggest that exogenous reinfaction has a drastic effect on the qualitative dynamics of TB. The incorporation of exogenous reinfaction into our TB model allows the possibility of a subcritical bifurcation at the critical value of the basic reproductive number R0 = 1, and hence the existence of multiple endemic equilibria for R0 < 1 and the exogenous reinfaction rate larger than a threshold. Our results suggest that reducing R0 to be smaller than one may not be sufficient to eradicate the disease. An additional reduction in reinfaction rate may be required. These results may also partially explain the recently observed resurgence of TB. (C) 2000 Academic Press.},

Based on this model and any given set of feasible alleles, an evolutionary stable strategy (ESS) can be found. Four types of ESS are possible and can be discriminated by graphical methods. These ESS values depend on population size, but population size can be reinterpreted as deme size in a structured population.

Simple mathematical models are provided to study the joint evolution of two cultural characters, one determining the viability and the fertility of individuals, and the other determining the vertical transmission rate of the first trait. Ordinary local stability analyses indicate that intrademic processes should lead to a greater reliance on vertical cultural transmission. On the other hand, when newly arisen variants are adaptive and favored in biased cultural transmission, interdemic processes may lead to a decrease in vertical transmission. This is because biased nonvertical transmission may effectively propagate the adaptive variants, further increasing the average growth rate of the population. These results are verified under several distinct sets of assumptions. It is also inferred that the degree and intensity of transmission bias may be the important determinants of cultural processes.},

There is evidence to believe the main factor for this resurgence has been the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Co-infection with HIV and M. Tuberculosis has profound implications for the course of both diseases. This study represents a first attempt to understand how the introduction of an opportunistic infection, namely Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the bacteria that causes TB, affects the dynamic interaction of HIV-1 and the immune system. We create a mathematical model using ordinary differential equations to describe the interaction of HIV and TB with the immune system. It is known that infection with TB can decrease the CD4+ T cell counts - a key marker of AIDS progression; thus, it shortens survival in HIV infected individuals. Another main marker for HIV progression is the viral load. If this load is increased due to the presence of opportunistic infections, the disease progression is much more rapid.

	abstract = {Dispersing predators and prey can exhibit complex spatio-temporal wave-like patterns if the interactions between them cause oscillatory dynamics. We study the effect of these predator-prey density waves on the competition between prey populations and between predator populations with different dispersal strategies. We first describe 1- and 2-dimensional simulations of both discrete and continuous predator-prey models. The results suggest that any population that diffuses faster, disperses farther, or is more likely to disperse will exclude slower diffusing, shorter dispersing, or less likely dispersing populations, everything else being equal. It also appears that it does not matter whether time, space, or state are discrete or continuous, nor what the exact interactions between the predators and prey are. So long as waves exist the competition between populations occurs in a similar fashion. We derive a theory that qualitatively explains the observed behaviour and calculate approximate analytical solutions that describe, to a reasonable extent, these behaviours. Predictions about the cost of dispersal are tested. If strong enough, cost can reverse the populations' relative competitive strengths or lead to coexistence because of the effect of spiral wave cores. The theory is also able to explain previous results of simulations of coexistence in host-parasitoid models.},

	abstract = {For a population subdivided into an arbitrary number (s) of subpopulations, each consisting of different numbers of separate sexes, with arbitrary distributions of family size and variable migration rates by males (d(m)) and females (d(f)), the recurrence equations for inbreeding coefficient and coancestry between individuals within and among subpopulations for a sex-linked locus are derived and the corresponding expressions for asymptotic effective size are obtained by solving the recurrence equations. The usual assumptions are made which are stable population size and structure, discrete generations, the island migration model, and without mutation and selection. The results show that population structure has an important effect on the inbreeding coefficients in any generation, asymptotic effective size, and F-statistics. Gene exchange among subpopulations inhibits inbreeding in initial generations but increases inbreeding in later generations. The larger the migration rate, the greater the final inbreeding coefficients and the smaller the effective size. Thus if the inbreeding coefficient is to be restricted to a specific value within a given number of generations, the appropriate population structure (the values of s, d(m), and d(f)) can be obtained by using the recurrence equations. It is shown that the greater the extent of subdivision (large s, small d(m) and d(f)), the larger the effective size. For a given subdivided population, the effective size for a sex-linked locus may be larger or smaller than that for an autosomal locus, depending on the sex ratio, variance and covariance of family size, and the extend of subdivision. For the special case of a single unsubdivided population, our recurrence equations for inbreeding coefficient and coancestry and formulas for effective size reduce to the simple expressions derived by previous authors.},

The monoecious, diploid population is subdivided into an infinite linear array of equally large, panmictic colonies that exchange gametes isotropically. The population density and the migration rate have a discontinuity at the origin, but are elsewhere uniform. Generations are discrete and nonoverlapping; the analysis is restricted to a single locus without selection; every allele mutates to new alleles at the same rate. The three dimensionless parameters in the theory are α = (ρ+/ρ-)2 (V+/V-)(3/2), and β(±) = 4ρ(±) √2uV(±), where ρ+ (ρ-) and V+ (V-) designate the population density and variance of gametic dispersion per generation to the right (left) of the discontinuity, respectively, and u denotes the mutation rate. The characteristic length on the right (left) is √V+/(2u) (√V-/(2u)). The probability of identity is continuous at the origin, but its partial derivatives have a discontinuity unless migration is conservative (ρ- V- = ρ+ V+). At least for nonconservative migration, the probability of identity (including the expected homozygosity) can be nonmonotonic even if the migration rate is uniform and the population density is monotonic. Thus, there can be a nonmonotonic genetic response in a neutral model to a monotonic environment.},

	abstract = {Work on how transposable elements are maintained and spread by virtue of their transposition processes have produced many theoretical studies of their evolutionary dynamics. But recent studies, which have experimentally identified some of these mechanisms, have not been taken into account. We present an integrated model of P transposable element regulation. It includes, at an individual level, the various mechanisms of regulation and the transposition events, that have been experimentally identified, recording specifically the chromosomal localisations of the inserted copies. It attempts to define the minimum conditions for explaining the regulation and spread of the P transposable element in Drosophila melanogaster natural populations. One test of this model is that it must explain the different population states found in the wild. A program that simulates the changes in Drosophila populations during the invasion of P elements was developed; the simulated populations were then compared to natural population data at the molecular and genetic levels. The model was validated by testing the dynamics of P element invasion in populations. It could explain the different natural population states with a recurrent invasion process. The simulations show that migration reduces the total number of copies, increases the number of defective copies, decreases P-activity and increases P-susceptibility, shifting equilibrium states from P to M'. They also show that the copies determining P-cytotype regulation spread faster by selection when located on the X chromosome. This result could account for the unexplained accumulation of P copies on the X chromosomes of some natural populations. Moreover the simulations predict a novel equilibrium state, called P', not yet characterized in natural populations but that can be found in natural population data.},

Here, we develop an approximation to the exact distribution of the conditional genealogy, including an approximation to the distribution of the time at which the mutation arose. The approximations are accurate for frequencies q < 5-10%. In addition, a simple and fast simulation scheme is constructed. We consider a demography parameterized by a d-dimensional vector α = (α1,..., α(d)). It is shown that the conditional genealogy and the age of the mutation have distributions that depend on a = qα and q only, and that the effect of q is a linear scaling of times in the genealogy; if q is doubled, the lengths of all branches in the genealogy are doubled. The theory is exemplified in two different demographies of some interest in the study of human evolution: (1) a population of constant size and (2) a population of exponentially decreasing size (going backward in time).

Aspects of the balance of fitnesses revealed by logistic regressions are discussed. It is demonstrated that logistic regression also discriminates between types of a stable polymorphism: globally stable polymorphism, several simultaneously stable polymorphisms, and stable equilibria in addition to a polymorphic one, which implies that different balances of fitnesses are responsible for the maintenance of different types of polymorphism. © 2000 Academic Press.},

In the case of sufficiently weak selection, the gene genealogy can be extracted from the ancestral graph. We demonstrate that the gene genealogy under this model is identical to that obtained for a diploid model with heterozygote advantage. The case of strong selection is exemplified by a one-locus haploid self-incompatibility system, in this context, we investigate the number of alleles that can be maintained in a spatial versus a non-spatial habitat.

We consider two cases: when the juvenile dispersal rate is allowed to change with maternal age and when it is not. In the latter case, we find that the unconditional evolutionarily stable dispersal rate increases when the adult survival rate increases. Two antagonistic forces act upon the evolution of age-specific dispersal rates. First, when the local age structure varies between patches of habitat, the intensity of competition between adults and juveniles in the natal patch is, on average, lower for offspring born to older senescent mothers. This selects for decreasing dispersal with maternal age. Second, offspring born to older parents are on average more related to other juveniles in the same patch and they experience a higher intensity of kin competition, which selects for increasing dispersal with maternal age. We show that the evolutionary outcome results from a balance between these two opposing forces, which depends on the amount of variance in age structure among sub-populations.

The models apply to insects such as many temperate forest pests that have a single generation per year and which are susceptible to viral disease only during their larval period. The disease kills the hosts after a fixed time period when infectious pathogen particles are released into the environment. Depending on the time taken to kill the host, one to many cycles of pathogen replication may occur during the portion of the year when susceptible hosts are present. A baseline model with linear disease transmission is always unstable although a stable equilibrium can be achieved if there is sufficient density dependence in the transmission process. Persistent, long-period cycles are virtually never observed. The release of pathogen particles prior to host death contributes towards stability although it does not result in limit cycles. Long-period cycles were found in two other extensions of the baseline model, one in which some hosts carry a sublethal infection which is transmitted to their offspring; and a second which includes a reservoir where pathogen particles are relatively long lived although unable to cause new infections. The relationship between this work and previous host pathogen and host parasitoid models is discussed.},

We present a four-species model of a pollination mutualism embedded in other types of community interactions. Conclusions derived from two-species models about the destabilizing effect of mutualisms are misleading when applied to the present scenario; although the mutualisms are locally destabilizing, the effect is more than canceled by an increased chance of feasibility. The crucial difference is the interaction of the mutualists with other species in a larger web. Furthermore, community persistence (without unrealistic population explosion), arguably a superior ecological criterion, is greatly enhanced by the presence of mutualisms. Therefore, we predict that mutualisms should be common in the real world, a prediction matching empirial findings and in contrast to the predictions from local stability analysis of basic two-species models. This method of stabilizing a mutualism appears superior in some ways to the often-used method of introducing density dependence in the strength of the mutualism, because it permits obligate mutualisms to exist even at low densities, again matching empirical findings. Lastly, this study is an example of how complex model assemblages can behave qualitatively differently from analogous simpler ones.},

For two loci and a sample size of two sequences, a detailed analysis of this process yields the joint distribution of the two trees (one at each locus). A number of interesting results follow from this analysis, including the distribution of the number of recombination events in the history of the sample. For the general case of in loci and samples of size n, we describe an algorithm for simulating the tree building process. Because analytic results are difficult to obtain in this case, we use simulation to study properties of trees at multiple linked loci such as total tree time and number of recombination events.},

	abstract = {We introduce a simple mathematical model to describe the behavior of a forager with a limited memory capacity in the presence of two prey types that differ in their energetic values. The model is used to analyze the effect of memory capacity on foraging behavior and on foraging energetics and it contrasts with classic optimal foraging theory, which implicitly assumes that the forager has an infinite memory capacity. Classic optimal foraging theory dictates that the low value prey type should be invariably excluded from the diet when the high value type exceeds some critical relative frequency and invariably consumed otherwise. Our model forager behaves similarly except that, as its memory capacity declines, it is increasingly predisposed to consume the low value prey when it is suboptimal to do so. Nevertheless, our analysis indicates that the energetic efficiency of a forager with an infinite memory capacity can be approximated by a forager with a memory of modest capacity, perhaps one that contains information about 5-20 previously consumed prey items. In our model, memory constraints necessarily result in so-called 'partial preferences' being exercised towards the low value prey type. Thus, limited memory capacity offers a possible explanation for observed violations of the 'zero-one' rule of optimal diet composition. We also find a resemblance to a sigmoidal shape in the relationship between the representation of each prey type in the diet and its relative frequency. Thus, the memory-constrained forager exhibits behavior that resembles the type III functional response. Therefore, it is possible that memory constraints such as we envisage can contribute to the explanation of both partial preferences and functional responses.},

Using two-patch models of single species, I explore two aspects of this interaction that have hitherto received little attention. First, how is the interaction affected when local density dependence changes from negative (logistic) to positive (Allee)? Second, how does dispersal mortality influence persistence? When local dynamics are logistic, dispersal changes the strength of negative density dependence within patches without much between-patch effect. For example, dispersal mortality reduces the population growth rate and counteracts the tendency towards complex dynamics. Density-dependent disperal amplifies the nonlinearity in the growth rate, thus opposing the stabilizing effects of dispersal mortality. Spatial heterogeneity has little or no effect on stability. In contrast to the logistic, dispersal under Allee dynamics creates between patch effects that bring about a qualitative change. Patches that fall below the Allee threshold are rescued from extinction by immigrants from patches that are above the threshold. Density-dependent dispersal enhances this rescue effect. Persistence below the extinction threshold is contingent on spatial heterogeneity. Dispersal mortality is of little or no consequence.},

It is typically carried out on a sample of affected individuals from a population isolate. If the chromosome neighborhood of a disease gene is saturated with markers, then each new mutation in the population or existing mutation introduced by a population founder exhibits a unique haplotype signature at the time of its introduction. Partial disruptions of these signatures by recombination can be visualized in affected and provide important clues to the location of the disease gene. The current paper models haplotype evolution with the intention of clarifying the most favorable circumstances for haplotype mapping. Comparisons with linkage mapping are stressed. For dominant diseases, both deterministic and stochastic models are suggested. Numerical examples based on Finnish population parameters illustrate the general theory in the presence of the complications of selection, mutation, and slow, exponential growth of the isolate.},

In this paper we explore an alternative solution concept. We call it neighborhood invader strategy (NIS). A NIS is a phenotype which is capable of invading all established populations of its neighbors. This phenotype need not be, at the same time, an ESS; and the reverse is true as well.

The model includes mechanisms of carbon and nitrogen exchange between soil and vegetation, biomass decomposition and microbial mineralization, and defoliation by pest grazers, which are partially controlled by avian or mammalian predators. Acidic deposition is assumed to directly damage vegetation, to decrease soil pH, which in turn damages roots and inhibits microbial activity, and to predispose trees to increased pest attack. All the model parameters are set to realistic values except the inflow of protons to soil and the predation mortality inflicted to the pest which are allowed to vary inside reasonable ranges. A numerical bifurcation analysis with respect to these two parameters is carried out. Five functioning modes are uncovered: (i) pest-free equilibrium; (ii) pest persisting at endemic equilibrium; (iii) forest-pest permanent oscillations; (iv) bistable behavior with the system converging either to pest-free equilibrium or endemic pest presence in accordance with initial conditions; (v) bistable behavior with convergence to endemic pest presence or permanent oscillations depending on initial conditions. Catastrophic bifurcations between the different behavior modes are possible, provided the abundance of predators is not too small. Numerical simulation shows that increasing acidic load can lead the forest to collapse in a short time period without important warning signals.},

	abstract = {Microsatellite variation and the mechanisms which are responsible for this variation have received much attention in the last few years. Most theoretical studies of microsatellite allele distributions, however, did not incorporate the evolutionary dynamics of linked sites. The dynamics is usually modeled by invoking a special mutation mechanism such as stepwise mutation, which leads to a stepwise increase or decrease of the number of motif repeats on the occasion of mutation. It is shown here that selection at a locus, which itself is not subject to mutation, but which is adjacent to a microsatellite locus has an influence on statistics of the microsatellite allele distribution, provided that mutation rates are low to intermediate, when compared to 1/t1, the inverse of the time to fixation of a linked favorable substitution. If mutation rates are high, as for example in humans, a selective effect upon the microsatellite locus, such as hitchhiking, will quickly be obscured by mutations. In particular, in the latter case, the model shows that no correlation is to be expected between recombination rates and variability of microsatellites - such as had been predicted and experimentally demonstrated for nucleotide variability and recombination rates in Drosophila. The presented model is a generalization of the two locus two allele hitchhiking model which had been studied by Stephan and co-workers.},

Various approaches to modeling have been developed to enable us to understand spatial patterns ranging from plant distributions to plankton aggregation. We present s new approach to modeling spatial interactions by deriving approximations for the time evolution of the moments (mean end spatial covariance) of ensembles of distributions of organisms; the analysis is made possible by 'moment closure,' neglecting higher-order spatial structure in the population. We use the growth and competition of plants in an explicitly spatial environment as a starting point for exploring the properties of second-order moment equations and comparing them to realizations of spatial stochastic models. We find that for a wide range of effective neighborhood sizes (each plant interacting with several to dozens of neighbors), the mean-covariance model provides a useful and analytically tractable approximation to the stochastic spatial model, and combines useful features of stochastic models and traditional reaction-diffusion-like models.},

The results motivate a population-level cell-based model with each cell representing a local population and parameterized by local extinction probabilities, rather than individual- based interaction rates. A detailed comparison of spatiotemporal plots from the two modelling frameworks shows that the population-level model captures the broad range of dynamics exhibited by the individual-based model. The agreement between these two complementary theoretical frameworks, one formulated at the level of individuals, the other at the level of populations, provides a mechanistic understanding of the dynamics.},

In this paper we construct several more realistic structured metapopulation models that include variation in patch quality and the rescue effect. These models predict both positive and negative correlations between the fractions of suitable patches and empty patches. The type of correlation depends in an intricate manner on the strength of the rescue effect and on the quality distribution of the patches to be destroyed. Empty patches can be considered as the resource limiting metapopulation growth. Our results demonstrate that the correlation between the fractions of suitable patches and empty patches is positive if and only if the average value of the resource decreases as the number of patches increases.},

All three types of aggregation may facilitate coexistence, provided the parasitoid species show behavioral differences that produce different patterns of aggregation. By deriving general conditions of coexistence of parasitoids, we show that all three types of aggregation act to facilitate coexistence in the same way-by increasing the covariance between the distributions of susceptible hosts and the least common parasitoid. Although they act in the same way, in general the effect of density-independent aggregation in facilitating coexistence is greater than either direct or inverse density-dependent aggregation. This suggests that density-independent aggregation may have the greatest potential to facilitate the coexistence of specialize parasitoids using the same host.},

There is therefore no justification for the truncation of distributions proposed to describe the abundances of species in natural communities. The mistake of the veil line points to the need for a general theory of sampling. If a community has a distribution g of species abundances and if samples taken of the community tend to follow distribution f, what is the relationship of f to g? The seeds of such a theory are available in the work of E. C. Pielou. Using the Poisson distribution as a close approximation to the hypergeometric, one may immediately write and (in most cases) solve the transformation from g to f. The transformation appears to preserve distribution formulas to within constants and parameters, providing yet another reason to rule out the use of truncation. Well beyond this application, the theory provides a foundation for rethinking the sampling process and its implications for ecology.},

	abstract = {We study interactions of predators and prey that are characterized by a scale difference in their use of space. Prey are assumed to occupy patches, forming a metapopulation with low migration among patches. Predators are homogeneously distributed over these patches, due to broad-scale foraging behavior or long-range juvenile dispersal. The predator population thus exerts a globally uniform predation pressure on the prey subpopulations. Under these conditions a nonlinear predator functional response depending on local prey density leads to multiple equilibria that can occur for the same parameter values. These equilibria differ in the fraction of prey patches that are (nearly) empty. Equilibria with a larger fraction of empty prey patches are more stable. The system tends to approach equilibria with a sufficiently high number of empty prey patches, so that local and global population dynamics are stable. If unstable dynamics are observed at all, the fluctuations in local prey density exhibit predictable characteristics. Our main conclusion is that a nonlinear functional response of the predator to local prey density can induce the formation of static patterns in prey density and, hence, lead to stable local and global dynamics. It is shown that these results are sufficiently general to carry over to situations in which prey migration between patches does occur or the spatial domain occupied by the prey population is continuous instead of subdivided into patches.},

	abstract = {Under the classical Fisher-Bulmer infinitesimal model of quantitative genetics, the within-family distribution for an additive trait with no environmental component is Gaussian with mean at the mid-parent value and a variance which is the same for all families. When an additive trait is determined by unlinked loci, the Fisher-Bulmer model can arise in the limit as the number of loci contributing to variation in the trait increases. However, a counterexample is presented where the Fisher-Bulmer model fails to arise in the infinite locus limit because there is too much linkage disequilibrium. An example is also presented where a degenerate form of the Fisher-Bulmer model arises. Under what conditions does the Fisher-Bulmer model arise in the infinite locus limit? It follows from the central limit theorem that the within-family distribution is Gaussian. But, under what conditions is the within-family distribution the same for almost all families in the population? An alternative population genetic derivation of the Fisher-Bulmer model is presented for a population at linkage equilibrium. This approach is then extended to allow many patterns of linkage disequilibrium. Diallelic models are used to illustrate the type of linkage disequilibrium allowed. The results on the limiting behaviour of population genetic models with many unlinked loci can be regarded as special cases of a more general limiting property of sequences of random variables. A possible application of this more general result to models of cultural inheritance is suggested.},

Price, has stressed that Fisher's fundamental theorem of natural selection about the increase in mean fitness is of general validity without any restrictive assumptions on the mating system, the fitness parameters, or the numbers of loci and alleles involved, but that it concerns only a partial change in mean fitness. This partial change is obtained by replacing the actual genotypic fitnesses by the corresponding additive genetic values and by keeping these values fixed in the change of the mean with respect to changes in genotype frequencies. We propose an alternate interpretation for this partial change which uses partial changes in genotype frequencies directly consequent on changes in gene frequencies, the fitness parameters being kept constant. We argue that this interpretation agrees more closely with Fisher's own explanations. Moreover, this approach leads to a decomposition for the total change in mean fitness which explains, unifies, and extends previous decompositions. We consider a wide range of models, from discrete-time selection models with nonoverlapping generations to continuous-time models with overlapping generations and age effects on viability and fecundity, which is the original framework for Fisher's fundamental theorem.},

	abstract = {We investigate the potential for coexistence of species that compete for a shared resource when the resource occurs in both a source area acting as a refuge and a sink area where it is used by the competing species. Our model shows that the mixing rate between the source and sink resource populations has a dramatic influence on the outcome of competition. When there is a strict sink-source dependence, so that resource renewal in the sink is entirely dependent on the source, only exploitation competition decides which species can survive at a very small mixing rate. Increasing the flow rate basically amounts to increasing the role played by interference competition. If interspecific interference is very small, compared with intraspecific interference, increasing the mixing rate allows coexistence of many species, indeed, unlimited coexistence if the species' resource exploitation efficiencies are similar enough. If interspecific interference is significant and there is a trade-off between the exploitation and interference competitive abilities of two species, it is possible to have one species replacing the other along a gradient of increasing mixing rate, with either coexistence or alternative single-species equilibria at intermediate values of the mixing rate. It is also possible to have one species always outcompeting the other, or alternative single-species stable equilibria at large mixing rates. When the strict sink-source dependence is relaxed by allowing the resource to have a partly independent renewal-loss dynamics in the sink area, the variety of possible outcomes along a gradient of mixing rate is further increased. These outcomes are often strongly sensitive to the parameters of resource dynamics end interspecific interference competition. The implications of these results for biological conservation can be profound; detailed knowledge of inter-specific interactions appears to be necessary to determine the effect of any land management that alters dispersal opportunities.},

	abstract = {According to the repair hypothesis, sex originated as a cooperative interaction-the benefit being damage repair. As with all cooperative strategies, cooperative sex may be vulnerable to selfish mutants. The purpose of the present paper is to understand what implications such selfish mutants may have both for the origin of sex, especially in competition with asexual diploidy, and for the elaboration of the sexual cycle, especially in facultatively sexual organisms. Asexual diploids are assumed to effectively and instantaneously repair all damages without expression of deleterious recessive mutations. Costs to asexual diploidy are considered in terms of its birth rate and mortality rate. The main results of the present paper are as follows. (i) Asexual diploidy wins when the costs of diploidy are small, mortality rates low, and damage rates high. (ii) Beginning with an ancestral state in which cells are asexual haploids, the sexual life cycle would emerge before asexual diploidy as a response to increasing DNA damage. (iii) Selfish sex is a far more robust repair strategy than cooperative sex, especially in competition with asexual diploidy. (iv) Although cooperative sex is more adaptive in extreme environments characterized by high damage and high mortality, selfish sex can still invade in these regions and take the entire system to extinction. (v) Once it is present, selfish sex is stable to asexual diploidy over a wide range of parameter values and can persist in regions of parameter space forbidded to the asexual diploid. These results help to address a concern of the gene repair theory of sex, which is that efficient repair in an asexual diploid is a better strategy than sex. Data from microbes bearing on the results are discussed as is the relationship between facultative sex in multicellular organisms and selfish sex in microbes.},

We show that local and regional dynamics can be described separately only if the variances of environmental fluctuations and the rates of dispersal (emigration and immigration) are below particular bounds. If environmental fluctuations and dispersal satisfy these conditions the local dynamics have a much faster time scale than the regional dynamics and extinction and recolonization can each be described by a single rate which depends on the parameters of the local dynamics and dispersal.},

The parameter γ is also allowed to be density dependent, and it is shown that the most successful strategies of this type are those for which γ is large for low densities and close to its minimum for high densities. A biological interpretation is given in the context of mobile females depositing their relatively sessile young on patches of resource, namely, females should overdisperse their young on resources when adult densities are high and underdisperse them when these densities are low. Finally the per capita growth rate parameter is also allowed to depend on γ.

To address this deficiency, we simulate a predator-prey system, where the prey population is composed of three phenotypes that differ in fecundity and predator evasiveness. We use equilibrium population size and allele frequencies to examine the relative effects of trait variation and correlation on mean population fitness. When no correlation is present, increasing variance in either trait increases equilibrium population size. Negative correlations coupled with increasing variance in both traits increases equilibrium population size. Positive correlations are more likely to increase equilibrium population size when variances are inversely related. With respect to allele frequencies, as variance in both traits increases, populations with positive correlations experience greater loss of genetic diversity than those with negative correlations. Thus, selection as a dynamic ecological process (frequency-dependent predation) favors trade-offs, whether they are between trait means (negative correlations) or variances (positive correlations).},

Depending on the ontogenetic size scaling, the model exhibited recruit-driven cycles, stable fixed point dynamics, non-recruit juvenile-driven cycles, quasiperiodic orbits, or chaotic dynamics. The kind of dynamics observed was related to the maintenance resource levels required of differently sized individuals. Stable fixed point dynamics was, besides at the persistence boundary, only observed when the minimum resource levels were similar for newborns and mature individuals. The tendency for large population fluctuations over a wide range of the parameter space was due to the consumer's pulsed reproduction. Background mortality and length of season were major determinants of cycle length. Model dynamics strongly resembled empirically observed dynamics from fish and Daphnia populations with respect to both patterns and mechanisms. The non-recruit juvenile-driven dynamics is suggested to occur in populations with size-dependent interference or preemptive competition like cicada populations.},

We consider a plant growing exponentially in a constant environment. Assumptions are the following: (1) The loss of leaves due to herbivory decreases with defense chemical concentration. (2) The daily net photosynthesis of a leaf decreases with its age. (3) Using photosynthetic products, the plant produces new leaves that may contain defense chemicals. (4) Although there is a cost to producing new defense chemicals, such chemicals can be reallocated without cost. In the optimal schedule calculated using Pontryagin's maximum principle, the chemical defense level decreases with leaf age. The optimal level of chemical defense increases with the cost of leaf production and herbivory intensity but decreases with the cost of defense chemical production, effectiveness of the defense chemical, net productivity, and growth rate of the plant. If both generalist and specialist herbivores attack the same plant, the optimal defense level is dependent only on the generalists' abundance and sensitivity, but in independent of the specialists that are unaffected by the defense chemical.},

	abstract = {Individual based, stochastic forest patch models have the potential to realistically describe forest dynamics. However, they are mathematically intransparent and need long computing times. We simplified such a forest patch model by aggregating the individual trees on many patches to height-structured tree populations with theoretical random dispersions over the whole simulated forest area. The resulting distribution-based model produced results similar to those of the patch model under a wide range of conditions. We concluded that the height-structured tree dispersion is an adequate population descriptor to capture the stochastic variability in a forest and that the new approach is generally applicable to any patch model. The simplified model required only 4.1% of the computing time needed by the patch model. Hence, this new model type is well-suited for applications where a large number of dynamic forest simulations is required.},

We focus on a three-locus model first studied by Feldman et al.

(1980) indicated that increased recombination might be favored if there is diminishing-returns epistasis, we show that allales that increase the recombination rate can only invade if there is synergistic epistasis between the loci under selection. Even with synergistic epistasis, evolution at the modifier locus will lead to decreased recombination if the modifier locus is loosely linked and epistasis is strong. Using the multi-locus analysis of Barton (1995), we show that variability among loci in the sign and strength of epistasis further decreases the parameter space over which increased recombination may evolve. We conclude that, even with negative epistasis, increased recombination may only be favored when linkage is tight, especially if, as seems likely, epistatic interactions are highly variable among loci.},

The expected numbers of offspring per individual are independently identically distributed over the periods. It is shown that the establishment probability of an invader varies over the reproduction periods according to a stable distribution. We give a method for simulating the establishment probabilities and approximations for the expected establishment probability. Furthermore, we show that, due to the stochasticity of the establishment success over different periods, the expected success of sequential invasions is larger then that of simultaneous invasions and we study the effects of environmental fluctuations on the extinction probability of small populations and metapopulations.

Criteria for the spread of cultural preferences and sex-chromosomal distorter alleles are derived analytically, and the coevolution of preferences and distorters is examined through numerical iteration.

The given starting conditions included age-specific survival rates of males and females and age-specific fecundity of females for each genotype (to simplify the problem I presumed no differences in survivorship or fecundity of genotypes with the same phenotype) and the same age structure for each genotype.

This result indicates that m is the only correct measure of fitness (i.e., as a predictor of which genotype should prevail from among a group of genotypes) and that comparisons of r, R0, LRS, juvenile or adult survival rates, or fecundity may be misleading indicators of which genotype should prevail (i.e., be most 'fit') over time (i.e., be selected for).},

	abstract = {Theoretical investigations of the dynamics of populations with discrete generations have traditionally been based on simple models of the form N(t+1)= f[N(t)]. However, recent studies of the dynamics of natural populations indicate that density-dependent population regulation probably takes place over many generations (N(t+1)=f[N(t), N(t-1), ...]). In this paper, I explore the stability properties of interacting populations and contrast the predictions of discrete-generation models of population growth which do and do not include delayed density dependence. Relative to non-delayed models, inclusion of delayed density dependence changes the shape of population cycles (flip vs Hopf bifurcations) and decreases the range of parameters which predict stable equilibria. I also explore extensions of these models that include interspecific competition and coupling of spatially isolated patches. In both cases, delayed density dependence significantly changes the way in which demographic parameters scale to overall dynamics. For example, when delayed density dependence does not differ between two species, the asymptotic stability of both species is determined by a weighted average of the population growth rates of the two species. However, when species differ in time delay, some pairs of species that would both exhibit cyclical or chaotic dynamics in isolation can stably coexist. Analogous conclusions hold for the effects of deterministic spatial environmental variation among coupled patches. This implies that inclusion of delayed density dependence in investigations of population dynamics can dramatically change the inferences we draw from mathematical models and that further investigations of the effects of deterministic differences in demographic parameters and of delayed density dependence are warranted.},

We then consider the dynamics of a third neutral locus and show that its approach to linkage equilibrium depends on the recombination rates and the selection intensities. There is an embedding or hitchhiking effect that extends the time during which a neutral locus which is closely linked to one of the selected loci remains in disequilibrium with both selected loci. Therefore, strong disequilibrium between two loci does not necessarily indicate that those loci are themselves selected, but it does indicate that there is strong selection acting at least on nearby loci. This property implies a warning that screening for linkage disequilibrium as a tool to identify functionally important sites in a genome can be misleading.},

	abstract = {Pleiotropic effects among quantitative characters are believed to be extensive and universal, although their actual amount and pattern remains to be determined. Theoretical studies have shown that pleiotropic effects can influence the dynamics of a character under stabilizing selection and mutation through genetic correlations as well as hidden pleiotropic effects. It is further known that pleiotropic effects on fitness can cause an apparent stabilizing selection for an otherwise neutral character. The response to directional selection also depends on genetic correlations to other characters via correlated selection responses and deleterious side effects. In this paper we analyze a class of models for the adaptation of complex organisms based on three assumptions: (1) pleiotropic effects among characters are extensive, even in the absence of genetic correlations (hidden pleiotropic effects); (2) directional selection only acts on one or a small number of characters simultaneously (mosaic evolution); (3) the remaining characters are either neutral or under stabilizing selection. We show that the response to directed natural selection is strongly influenced by hidden pleiotropic effects on a second uncorrelated character which is under stabilizing selection. The hidden pleiotropic effects are inducing apparent stabilizing selection which interacts with the directional selection acting on the first character. The apparent stabilizing selection is mediated through the dynamics of the genetic variance associated with a change in the mean genotypic value. The result can be either inhibitory or accelerating, depending on the frequency of the alleles. The inhibitory effect can even completely prevent a response to directional selection if apparent stabilizing selection is strong compared to directional selection. In finite populations, the asymptotic rate of evolution is also influenced by hidden pleiotropic effects. This is mostly caused by a reduction of the asymptotic genetic variance maintained by mutation under sustained directional selection. It is concluded that hidden pleiotropic effects lead to adaptive inertia even in the absence of genetic correlations.},

The data base was used to investigate the following properties of stable equilibria maintaining a polymorphism in a given number of loci that are expected a priori, i.e., without any constraints on fitnesses of genotypes: probability for a fitness set to yield a such equilibrium; probability for a random trajectory to converge to a such equilibrium; genetic load at a such equilibrium. The expected number of simultaneously stable equilibria, and the fraction of genome maintained polymorphic were also investigated as well as some parameters expected at an equilibrium maintaining all loci polymorphic. One of the most important findings is that multilocus genetic systems have a potential for maintaining a polymorphism in a large number of loci under selection without an input of new genetic variation.},

	abstract = {A mathematical model is presented for the dynamics of predator-prey interactions when predators do not consume prey (or clumps of prey) in their entirety. Using a combination of analytical and numerical methods, I demonstrate that predator-mediated changes in the distribution of intact and partially consumed prey can affect the outcome of competition between predators in unexpected ways. In some cases, two predators can coexist on a single prey species owing to tradeoffs between the ability to consume prey completely and other competitive abilities. In other cases, predators exhibit frequency-dependent dynamics in which the first predator to occupy the habitat can prevent the other from invading. Conditions for stable coexistence usually expand if the larger predator scatters uneaten prey parts, if prey renewal includes both small and large items, or if the predator with the smaller retrieval capacity is poor at catching intact prey relative to the other predator.},

	abstract = {The three-domain proposal of Woese et al. (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87, 4576 (1990)) divides all living organisms into three primary groups or domains named Archaea (or archaebacteria), Bacteria (or eubacteria), and Eucarya (or eukaryotes), with Eucarya being relatives (or descendants) of Archaea. Although this proposal is currently widely accepted, sequence features and phylogenies derived from many highly conserved proteins are inconsistent with it and point to a close and specific relationship between archaebacteria and gram-positive bacteria, whereas gram-negative bacteria are indicated to be phylogenetically distinct. A closer relationship of archaebacteria to gram-positive bacteria in comparison to gram-negative bacteria is generally seen for the majority of the available gene/protein sequences. To account for these results, and the fact that both archaebacteria and gram-positive bacteria are prokaryotes surrounded by a single cell membrane, I propose that the primary division within prokaryotes is between Monoderm prokaryotes (surrounded by a single membrane) and Diderm prokaryotes (i.e., all true gram-negative bacteria containing both an inner cytoplasmic membrane and an outer membrane). This proposal is consistent with both cell morphology and signature sequences in different proteins. Protein phylogenies and signature sequences also show that all eukaryotic cells have received significant gene contributions from both an archaebacterium and a gramnegative eubacterium. Thus, the hypothesis that archaebacteria and eukaryotes shared a common ancestor exclusive of eubacteria, or that the ancestral eukaryotic cell directly descended from an archaea, is erroneous. These results call into question the validity of the currently popular three-domain proposal and the assignment of a domain status to archaebacteria. A new classification of organisms consistent with phenotype and macromolecular sequence data is proposed.},

Metapopulations also could persist without environmental variability (as found by Adler), but this occurred at very particular dispersal rates, quite different from those allowing persistence with environmental variability.},

	abstract = {Numerous investigators have suggested that herbivores almost always increase rates of nutrient and energy flow through terrestrial ecosystems by returning to the soil fecal material and urine with faster turnover rate than shed plant litter. These previous theories and models always treat the producer compartment as a homogenous pool. Essentially, they assume that consumers feed through a pureed cream of vegetable soup. However, many field observations and experiments have shown that consumers feed selectively (i.e., in a cafeteria) and that consumer choice is made on the same chemical basis that determines decomposition rates. Plants that are preferred food sources often have higher nutrient content, higher growth rates, and faster decomposition rates. As consumption reduces dominance of these species in favor of unpreferred species with slower decomposition, rates of nutrient cycling and energy flow should therefore decline. We analyze a model in which the consumer is given a choice among producers that vary in nutrient uptake rates, rates of nutrient return to decomposers, and consumer preference, and which is parameterized for plants and consumers characteristic of boreal regions. In this model, in an open, well-mixed system with one consumer and two such producers, the nutrient/energy flow will not exceed that of a system without the consumer. If the consumer has a choice between two such producers, it must choose one plant over the other at a greater ratio than that between the two plants in uptake and decay rates. In contrast, in a closed system the consumer must be less selective to coexist with the two plants. The system behavior is determined by the level of nutrient return through the consumer and the differences between the plants in nutrient uptake rates and consumer preference. Species richness affects properties of this model system to the extent that species are functionally distinct (i.e., have different rate constants) in a multivariate space of life history traits (i.e., nutrient uptake and palatability). We suggest that the biochemical variability of plant tissues that simultaneously determines both consumer preference and decomposition rates is an essential feature of food webs that cannot be ignored. Thus, ecosystem models should, at minimum, consider more than one producer type with consumer preference.},

It is suggested that (i) the progressive change in T was caused by a rise in population size (N) and an increased susceptibility (β) related to malnutrition and (ii) epidemics were driven by oscillations in low autumn temperature (p<0.001) and by cycles of susceptible young children produced by malnutrition during pregnancy.},

The time-dependent uncertainty analysis enabled us to evaluate the variability in the epidemiological outcome variables of the model during the progression of a tuberculosis epidemic. Calculated values (from the uncertainty analysis) for the disease incidence, disease prevalence, and mortality rates were approximately consistent with historical data. The time-dependent sensitivity analysis revealed that only a few of the model's input parameters significantly affected the severity of a tuberculosis epidemic; these parameters were the disease reactivation rate, the fraction of infected individuals who develop tuberculosis soon after infection, the number of individuals that an infectious individual infects per year, the disease death rate, and the population recruitment rate. Our analysis demonstrates that it is possible to improve our understanding of the behavior of tuberculosis epidemics by applying time-dependent uncertainty and sensitivity analysis to a transmission model.},

	abstract = {R. A. Fisher and H. J. Muller argued in the 1930s that a major evolutionary advantage of recombination is that it allows favorable mutations to be combined within an individual even when they first appear in different individuals. This effect is evaluated in a two-locus, two-allele model by calculating the average waiting time until a new genotypic combination first appears in a haploid population. Three approximations are developed and compared with Monte Carlo simulations of the Wright-Fisher process of random genetic drift in a finite population. First, a crude method, based on the deterministic accumulation of single mutants, produces a waiting time of 1/√Nμ2 with no recombination and 1/3√1/3 RNμ2 with recombination between the two loci, where μ is the mutation rate, N is the haploid population size, and R is the recombination rate. Second, the waiting time is calculated as the expected value of a heterogeneous geometric distribution obtained from a branching process approximation. This gives accurate estimates for Nμ large. The estimates for small values of Nμ are considerably lower than the simulated values. Finally, diffusion analysis of the Wright-Fisher process provides accurate estimates for Nμ small, and the time scales of the diffusion process show a difference between R = 0 and for R >> 0 of the same order of magnitude as seen in the deterministic analysis. In the absence of recombination, accurate approximations to the waiting time are obtained by using the branching process for high Nμ and the diffusion approximation for low Nμ. For low Nμ the waiting time is well approximated by 1/√8N2μ3. With R >> 0, the following dependence on Nμ is observed: For Nμ > 1 the waiting time is virtually independent of recombination and is well described by the branching process approximation. For Nμ ≃ 1 the waiting time is well described by a simplified diffusion approximation that assumes symmetry in the frequencies of single mutants. For Nμ << 1 the waiting time is well described by the diffusion approximation allowing asymmetry in the frequencies of single mutants. Recombination lowers the waiting time until a new genotypic combination first appears, but the effect is small compared to that of the mutation rate and population size. For large Nμ, recombination has a negligible effect, and its effect is strongest for small Nμ, in which case the waiting time approaches a fixed fraction of the waiting time for R = 0. Free combination lowers the waiting time to about 45% of the waiting time for absolute linkage for small Nμ. Selection has little effect on the importance of recombination in general.},

The environments in which these models are parameterized may be spatially heterogeneous. We demonstrate that, even in the absence of interaction between individuals, nonzero estimates of competitive or facilitative coefficients can result from environmental heterogeneity when densities are not experimentally imposed. We show this using a model of individual position and size in a simple environment composed of two patch types. Suppose two noninteracting species are intermixed in the study area and species 1 becomes established more readily in the patch type in which species 2 grows larger and has higher fecundity. Analyses that ignore environmental heterogeneity may indicate that species 1 facilitates species 2 because larger individuals of species 2 will tend to be associated with greater numbers of species 1. Similarly, environmental pseudocompetition can result if species 2 is more frequent among small individuals of species 1. The strength of the environmental pseudointeraction depends on (a) the magnitude of the size and fecundity differences between patch types, (b) the magnitude of the establishment differences between patch types, and (c) the size, relative to the environmental grain, of the neighborhood or quadrat used for sampling the number of competitor individuals.},

	abstract = {The effect of genetic recombination (or crossover) by sexual reproduction on the time until a novel set of genes performing a combined function appears, spreads, and becomes fixed is studied. First, we study a haploid finite population with many binary loci, in which only one sequence (called a functional gene set) is significantly advantageous over the others. The time for evolution of the function (T(d)) is defined as the mean number of generations until the advantageous sequence dominates in an initially random population. When the sequence diversity is initially stored sufficiently, the evolution time T(d) is roughly the product of the waiting time until the appearance of the advantageous sequence (creation time T(c)) and the average number of appearances of the advantageous sequence from its absence until its fixation (destruction number N(d)). Mutation and crossover reduce the former but enlarge the latter. If the mutation rate is low, there is an intermediate optimal rate of crossover that achieves the minimum T(d). In contrast, if the mutation rate is sufficiently high, T(d) is smallest without crossover. Second, the breakdown of established functions by recurrent deleterious mutation in an infinite population is examined. The number of functional genes maintained decreases monotonically with the recurrent deleterious mutation rate. Thus in higher organisms having many functional sets of genes in the genome, the mutation rate must be kept very low to preserve them, and hence a high crossover rate made possible by sexual reproduction is important in accelerating the evolution of novel functional sets of genes. Implications of this long-term advantage of recombination in the maintenance of sexual reproduction in higher organisms are discussed.},

For realistic values of the parameters the model behaves chaotically, but its dynamics within the strange attractor can be described by a few one-dimensional maps that allow one to forecast the next yearly peak of plankton or fish from the last peaks. This property is an unambiguous mark of a special form of chaos. Unfortunately, the estimate of such peak-to-peak maps from field data is possible only if plankton or young fish biomass has been sampled accurately and frequently for a paramount number of years. In conclusion, the analysis shows that it might be that plankton dynamics are characterized by an interesting and peculiar form of chaos, but that inferences from recorded data on the existence of these forms of chaos are premature.},

	abstract = {Polymorphisms at tandem repeat loci are caused by mutations with allele sizes occasionally altered by more than one repeat unit in both forward and backward directions. Such mutational changes may occur with asymmetric probabilities. Therefore, a one-step symmetric stepwise mutation model may not be appropriate for studying the population dynamics at all repeat loci. In this work, we evaluated the expectation and variance of the within- population variance of the allele size distribution in a finite population, and the expected homozygosity at a locus by the coalescence approach under a general stepwise mutation model, where mutational transitions of allele sizes can be arbitrary, including being asymmetric. Under the special cases of symmetric one-step, two-step, and multi-step geometric distributions of mutations, our general results reduce to the corresponding results obtained by earlier investigators. The general results indicate that in a finite population, which has reached a steady state under the (general stepwise) mutation and drift balance, the within-population variance of allele sizes has a simple expectation (i.e., proportional to Nv. the product of the mutation rate, v, and effective population size, N). However, its stochastic variance is a quadratic function of this composite parameter, Nv. Furthermore, this second-order variance does not decay with the number of alleles sampled from a population. Application of this theory to data on allele size distributions in unrelated Caucasians from the CEPH pedigree (obtained from the Genome Data Base) shows that the relationship of the variance and mean of within-population variance of allele size at tandem repeat loci, grouped by their chromosomal assignment, has a trend compatible with the theory. However, there is an indication that the second-order variance is generally underestimated. One reason for this departure might be that the CEPH sample may not represent a single homogeneous population that reached equilibrium at all tandem repeat loci.},

	abstract = {The mountain pine beetle [MPB, Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins (Coleoptera: Scolytidae)] is an aggressive bark beetle, one that typically needs to kill host trees in order to successfully reproduce. This ecological adaptation has resulted in an organism that is both economically important and ecologically significant. Even though significant resources have been expended on MPB research, and a great deal of knowledge exists regarding individual aspects of MPB ecology, some of the most basic questions regarding outbreaks remain unanswered. In our opinion, one reason for the lack of synthesis and predictive power is the inadequate treatment of spatial dynamics in outbreak theories. This paper explicitly addresses the role of spatial dynamics in the precipitation and propagation of MPB outbreaks. We first describe a spatially dynamic model of the MPB/forest interaction that includes chemical ecology, spatial redistribution of beetles, attack, and resulting host mortality. The model is a system of 6 coupled, partial differential equations with 7 state variables and 20 parameters. It represents an attempt to capture the relatively complex predator/prey interaction between MPB and host trees by including the minimum phenomenological descriptions necessary for ecological credibility. This system of equations describes the temporal dynamics of: beetle attraction as a function of pheromone concentration; the change in numbers of flying and nesting beetles; tree resistance/susceptibility; and tree recovery from attack. Spatial dynamics are modeled by fluxes due to gradients in pheromones and kairomones, and the random redistribution of beetles in absence of semiochemicals. We then use the parameterized model to explore three issues central to the ecology of MPB/forest interaction. The first of these is in response to the need for objective ways to compare patterns of successful beetle attacks as they evolve in space. Simulation results indicate that at endemic levels, the pattern of successful attacks are determined almost exclusively by the underlying distribution of susceptible host trees (environmental determinism). As an outbreak develops, the pattern of successfully attacked trees switches to one that is dynamically driven by the self-generated semiochemical landscape (dynamic determinism). This switch from an environmentally determined spatial pattern to a dynamically driven pattern is the hallmark of an outbreak. We discuss the application of a spatial correlation coefficient that can be used to differentiate between the spatial distribution of killed trees in endemic and outbreak phases. The second issue we address through simulation is synchrony in adult emergence. Synchronous adult emergence is critical for the mass attack strategy necessary for overcoming tree defenses. Results from these simulations indicate that the degree of synchrony in adult emergence can have important consequences for assessing the risk of an outbreak. The final issue we investigate through simulation is the effect of spatial pattern of nurse trees (those successfully attacked the previous year) on outbreak potential. Simulations indicated that the spatial proximity of nurse trees was an important determinant of subsequent successful attacks. We conclude with a discussion of the general implications of our simulation experiments.},

In this paper we first give simple general formulations to derive all the components of total genetic variance in a random sample for any multilocus model. We then derive these components for a series of fifteen models that have been proposed as being the two-allele two-locus models most likely for disease. We discuss the restrictions and limitations on the penetrance and the gene frequencies, implied by the disease prevalence, for each model. We investigate the relative magnitudes of the components of variance for the various models and show that in six of the models one or other of the epistatic variance components can be larger than each of the other components. It is suggested that investigations be undertaken to develop appropriate sampling and analytical techniques to detect these variance components by linkage analysis.},

Each gene corresponds to a single locus at which there is no recombination. The genealogy of the sample is embedded in a graph which we call the ancestral selection graph. This graph contains all the information about the ancestry; it is the analogue of Kingman's coalescent process which arises in the case with no selection. The ancestral selection graph can be easily simulated and we outline an algorithm for simulating samples. The main goal is to analyze the ancestral selection graph and to compare it to Kingman's coalescent process. In the case of no mutation, we find that the distribution of the time to the most recent common ancestor does not depend on the selection coefficient and hence is the same as in the neutral case. When the mutation rate is positive, we give a procedure for computing the probability that two individuals in a sample are identical by descent and the Laplace transform of the time to the most recent common ancestor of a sample of two individuals; we evaluate the first two terms of their respective power series in terms of the selection coefficient. The probability of identity by descent depends on both the selection coefficient and the mutation rate and is different from the analogous expression in the neutral case. The Laplace transform does not have a linear correction term in the selection coefficient. We also provide a recursion formula that can be used to approximate the probability of a given sample by simulating backwards along the sample paths of the ancestral selection graph, a technique developed by Griffiths and Tavare (1994).},

	abstract = {In this paper we build upon and generalize an earlier model of the interactions between a plant and its pollinator (Ingvarsson and Lundberg, 1995). In this model we assume that the performance of the pollinator population is directly linked to the size of the plant population. To avoid the problem of both populations growing exponentially we have, without loss of generality, assumed the plant population to be resource limited. Analysis of the system shows that there exists either two or no internal equilibrium points. The case with no equilibrium points corresponds to the trivial case where the system cannot persist, resulting in the extinction of both the plant and pollinator population. When the two internal equilibrium points do exist, one of them will always be unstable. This unstable equilibrium can be viewed as an equivalent of the threshold criteria derived in Ingvarsson and Lundberg (1995) in the sense that whenever the system is initiated above the unstable equilibrium point, persistence of the system is assured, while both species will go extinct whenever the system is initiated below the unstable equilibrium point. The analytical results were verified by numerical simulations of the system. We conclude that the existence of a threshold criteria, below which the system cannot persist is a general feature of plant-pollinator systems. We discuss how the existence of the threshold criteria will affect the persistence of plant-pollinator systems in light of, for instance, habitat fragmentation or stochastic reductions in the densities of either the plant or pollinator population. We further highlight some recent empirical studies that indicate the existence of a threshold in natural populations below which extinction is inevitable.},

	abstract = {We study the form of polymorphisms that can be maintained by the joint effects of generation overlap and randomly fluctuating selection, acting on a quantitative trait affecting offspring viability. The genetic system can be single locus or multilocus, haploid of diploid. Selection is assumed to be stabilizing with a randomly fluctuating optimum, and we assume additive allelic effects without epistasis. For fluctuations above a certain threshold, nonzero genetic variance is maintained in an evolutionarily stable population. Our model allows a continuum of alleles with arbitrary effects at each locus. Nonetheless, the genotype distribution in an evolutionarily stable population is discrete a polymorphism of a few alleles with distinctly different effects and often involves only a pair of alleles at each locus. The form of the genotype distribution depends on the number of loci affecting the trait, and on the kurtosis of the distribution of the phenotypic optimum 0. If the trait is affected by several loci, the number of polymorphic loci increases with increased variance of fluctuations in selection. For distributions of 0 with negative kurtosis (i.e., lower kurtosis than a Gaussian) the number of polymorphic loci increases gradually (0 → 1 → 2 → ··· M), and the genetic variability is in the form of a few diallelic of triallelic loci with alleles of large effect. For distributions with positive kurtosis, the increase is abrupt (0 → many) and involves many diallelic loci. These results do not fit the conventional multivariate Gaussian or near-Gaussian models for quantitative traits, but may partially explain recent findings that heritable variation in natural populations is often due to genes of large effect.},

	abstract = {We present two autosomal two-locus models in which the primary locus, A, may be imprinted according to the alleles present at the second, modifier locus, M. In the first model, the modifier is cis-acting, which assumes that imprinting occurs late in gametogenesis: whether or not A is imprinted depends only on the M allele in the (unfertilized) egg. We examine three cases in which polymorphism at A is maintained by a mutation-selection balance or heterozygote advantage. We show that a newly arising modifier allele without direct fitness effects can increase at a rate only of the order of the mutation rate at the A locus. This result mirrors that found in two-locus models of the evolution of dominance modifiers. Modifiers that also alter fitnesses, however, may spread quickly. In the second model, a monomorphic primary locus, A, is imprinted according to the mother's genotype at the second, diallelic modifier locus, M. The model is therefore trans-acting, which assumes imprinting occurs early in gametogenesis: whether or not A is imprinted depends on both of the mother's M genes. We show that a newly arising modifier will increase in frequency via selection if either imprinting is advantageous and the modifier increases the proportion of imprinted gametes or imprinting is disadvantageous and the proportion is decreased. Both of these factors-the selective effect of imprinting and the proportion of gametes imprinted-affect the rate of modifier evolution. Selectively maintained polymorphism at the modifier locus is unlikely unless the alleles interact in a nonadditive fashion.},

In a stochastic environment, the difference between the first two Lyapunov exponents is known to be analogous to the logarithm of the damping ratio, but there has been no systematic investigation of the consequences of environmental variation on convergence rates. In this study, the Lyapunov spectrum has been calculated for a wide variety of density-independent projection matrices subject to random variations in vital rates. This allows the impact of these random variations on convergence rates to be assessed. For rapidly convergent life histories, stochastic variation leads to a decrease in convergence rate. For life histories which are slow to converge, stochastic variation speeds up convergence. These effects are, however, relatively minor, and the value of the damping ratio for the mean matrix is a good predictor of the damping ratio in a stochastic environment. Consequently, when only an approximate indication of convergence rates is needed, the damping ratio for the mean projection matrix gives a very good guide. Detailed calculations of the Lyapunov spectrum would only be necessary to make comparisons between similar life histories or if very precise information on convergence rates were needed.},

	abstract = {Spatial extent can have two important consequences for population dynamics: It can generate spatial structure, in which individuals interact more intensely with neighbors than with more distant conspecifics, and it allows for environmental heterogeneity, in which habitat quality varies spatially. Studies of these features are difficult to interpret because the models are complex and sometimes idiosyncratic. Here we analyze one of the simplest possible spatial population models, to understand the mathematical basis for the observed patterns: two patches coupled by dispersal, with dynamics in each patch governed by the logistic map. With suitable choices of parameters, this model can represent spatial structure, environmental heterogeneity, or both in combination. We synthesize previous work and new analyses on this model, with two goals: to provide a comprehensive baseline to aid our understanding of more complex spatial models, and to generate predictions about the effects of spatial structure and environmental heterogeneity on population dynamics. Spatial structure alone can generate positive, negative, or zero spatial correlations between patches when dispersal rates are high, medium, or low relative to the complexity of the local dynamics. It can also lead to quasiperiodicity and hyperchaos, which are not present in the nonspatial model. With density-independent dispersal, spatial structure cannot destabilize equilibria or periodic orbits that would be stable in the absence of space. When densities in the two patches are uncorrelated, the probability that the population in a patch reaches extreme low densities is reduced relative to the same patch in isolation; this 'rescue effect' would reduce the probability of metapopulation extinction beyond the simple effect of spreading of risk.},

	abstract = {Analytical molecular distance estimates can be inaccurate and biased estimates of the total number of substitutions not only when the model of evolution they are based on is incorrect, but also when the method of estimating the total is too simple. This comes about because when there are different types of substitutions occurring simultaneously, it can become extremely difficult to estimate the number of the more quickly evolving type, and the variance of this larger number can overwhelm the total estimate. In this paper, in an extension of earlier work with a simple two-parameter model of evolution, more accurate analytical distances are derived for models appropriate to a variety of known DNA types using generalized least squares principles of noise reduction. It is shown that the new estimates can be applied to achieve more accurate results for site-to-site rate variation, regions with biased nucleotide frequencies, and synonymous sites in protein-coding regions. This study also includes a methodology to obtain accurate distance estimates for large numbers of sequence regions evolving in different manners.},

	abstract = {I consider a population structured by age, size, condition, or any other relevant state variable. The environment fluctuates from year to year. Each year population members must make a reproductive decision before the environmental conditions of that year are known. I follow the standard approach in which one considers a subpopulation composed of individuals of the same genotype in an asexual species (or of individuals sharing the same allele for controlling behaviour in a sexual species). The fitness of the genotype is then defined as an appropriate growth rate for this subpopulation. The structure vector for the subpopulation describes the distribution of individual states of subpopulation members. Here the collective action of subpopulation members is viewed as giving an immediate reward to the genotype (or allele) and influencing the distribution of the structure vector next year. Fitness is characterised as the long-term average reward so obtained. Reproductive value is defined on structure vectors, that is, on distributions of states, not on individual states. An optimal strategy maximises the sum of the current reward and the expected reproductive value of the structure vector in one year's time. In this definition of optimality, individuals are allowed to base their actions on the current structure vector and hence on the current states of kin. When individuals are only allowed to base their actions on their own state, an optimal strategy maximises an appropriate average of current reward plus expected future reproductive value. The optimality criteria described lead to natural methods by which optimal strategies can be calculated.},

	abstract = {We consider the impact of a colonization process on the genetic diversity and spatial structure of a geographically subdivided population. A stepping-stone model combined with coalescence theory is used to predict the evolution of sequence divergence and genetic parameters. We first derive analytical results for coalescence times in a population undergoing logistic growth. We next consider a stepping-stone model in which demes are successively colonized, starting from a first deme at one of the borders of the metapopulation. We use recurrence equations to calculate coalescence times for two genes chosen either inside the same deme or in different demes. This allows us to obtain the distribution and the expectation of the coalescence times, and to deduce from them the distribution of the average pairwise differences and the evolution of F(st). Our results reflect the impact of the founder effect, which becomes stronger as the distance of the deme from the first deme increases. An increase in migration rate or growth rate generally leads to a decrease of the founder effect. F(st) (i) increases during the beginning of the colonization, (ii) decreases when migration creates homogenization and (iii) increases again towards an equilibrium value. The distributions of pairwise coalescence times or differences between sequences show a peak corresponding to the colonization period. These results could help detect former colonization events in natural populations.},

The desired distribution corresponds to the distribution of sojourn times of the process in a small set of vertices. The sojourn times are well approximated via the Poisson clumping heuristic. It is shown explicitly that there is no 'equivalent' number of independently segregating loci that will yield the same results as with the genomic continuum model.

The sampling distribution of allele types depends on the sample size N, the array of allele frequencies among immigrants p, and the parameter 0 = φ/λ, where φ is the immigration rate and λ is the individual birth rate. The sampling distribution of alleles does not depend on time or population size, and no 'genetic equilibrium' assumption is therefore needed to apply the model to natural populations. The moments of the sampling distribution of allele types are used to calculate the expectation and variance of a sample identity by descent estimate (f0/(N)) within islands under the BDI model.},

This approach can be expensive and time consuming. An alternative approach is to use prevalence data to reconstitute incidence. Current-status are readily available or easily gathered and can be used to estimate incidence rates. Under certain assumptions of irreversibility for the outcome of interest, we discuss a simple transmission model appropriate to evaluate health interventions that confer long term protection. Rates and populations are parameter-free functions of age and calendar time. We develope general mathematical relationships that link incidence and intervention rates to prevalence which could be estimated from sampling without requiring knowledge of subpopulation demographics.},

	abstract = {Starting with a sinusoidal birth function, we derive an explicit expression for the associated wave of net maternity (R(t)). The phase shift and relative amplification of R(t) depend heavily on the cycle length of oscillation (T) relative to the mean age of net maternity (μ) and on the amplitude of oscillation of the birth function. For short cycle lengths (up to about 12 years), the birth and R(t) functions are virtually identical. When the cycle length is long (over 120 years). R(t) is essentially equal to the ratio of the number of births at time t to that at time t - μ. The R(t) function oscillates with the same cycle length as the birth function, but it is not sinusoidal and its asymmetry increases as the amplitude of birth function increases. This paper breaks new ground by providing a complete description of the dynamics of the model, including an analysis of the sensitivity of T(t) to the amplitude of the birth function, which was not accessible to previous approaches.},

We assume discrete-generation population dynamics, in which some parameters fluctuate between years. The fluctuation of parameters can be of any magnitude, including both fluctuation traditionally treated as diffusion processes and fluctuation from catastrophes within a single scheme. We develop a new approximate method of calculating the asymptotic rate of population extinction per year, β = ∫0/(∞) exp(-x) u(x) dx, where u(x) is the stationary distribution of adult population size from the continuous-population model including environmental stochasticity and population-regulation but neglecting demographic stochasticity. The method can be regarded as a perturbation expansion of the transition operator for population size. For several sets of population growth functions and probability distributions of environmental fluctuation, the stationary distributions can be calculated explicitly. Using these, we compare the predictions of this approximate method with that using a full transition operator and with the results of a direct Monte Carlo simulation. The approximate formula is accurate when the intrinsic rate of population increase is relatively large, though the magnitude of environmental fluctuation is also large. This approximation is complementary to the diffusion approximation.},

	abstract = {Models of costly signalling are commonly employed in evolutionary biology in order to explain how honest communication between individuals with conflicting interests can be stable. These models have focused primarily on a single type of honest signalling equilibrium, the separating equilibrium in which any two different signallers send distinct signals, thereby providing signal receivers with complete information. In this paper, we demonstrate that in signalling among relatives (modelled using the Sir Philip Sidney game), there is not one but a large number of possible signalling equilibria, most of which are pooling equilibria in which different types of signallers may share a common signal. We prove that in a general Sir Philip Sidney game, any partition of signallers into equi-signalling classes can have a stable signalling equilibrium if and only if it is a contiguous partition, and provide examples of such partitions. A similar (but slightly stricter) condition is shown to hold when signals are transmitted through a medium with signalling error. These results suggest a solution to a problem faced by previous signalling theory models: when we consider the separating equilibrium, signal cost is independent of the frequency of individuals sending that signal and, consequently, even very rare signaller types can drastically affect signal cost. Here, we show that by allowing these rare signallers to pool with more common signallers, signal cost can be greatly reduced.},

This holds for a sufficiently short correlation time T(c) of the fluctuations compared to the internal time scale of population growth r-1 (T(c)/r-1 << 1). Using a time-discrete simulation model we investigate when the white noise approximation is misleading. Environmental fluctuations are related to fluctuations of the birth and death rates of the species and the temporal correlation of these fluctuations (coloured noise) is described by a first-order autoregressive process. We found that extinction risk increases rapidly with correlation time T(c) if the strength of noise is large. In this case the white noise approximation underestimates extinction risk essentially unless temporal correlation is very small (T(c)/r-1 << 0.1). Extinction risk increases only slowly with correlation time if the strength of noise is small. Then the white noise approximation may be used even for stronger temporal correlations (T(c)/r-1≤0.1). Thus, the estimation of extinction risk on the basis of white or coloured noise must be justified by time scale and strength of the fluctuations. Especially for species that are sensitive to environmental fluctuations the applicability of the white noise approximation should be carefully checked.},

	abstract = {The stepwise mutation model, which was at one time chiefly of interest in studying the evolution of protein charge-states, has recently undergone a resurgence of interest with the new popularity of microsatellites as phylogenetic markers. In this paper we describe a method which makes it possible to transfer many population genetics results from the standard infinite sites model to the stepwise mutation model. We study in detail the properties of pairwise differences in microsatellite repeat number between randomly chosen alleles. We show that the problem of finding the expected squared distance between two individuals and finding the variance of the squared distance can be reduced for a wide range of population models to finding the mean and mean square coalescence times. In many cases the distributions of coalescence times have already been studied for infinite site problems. In this study we show how to calculate these quantities for several population models. We also calculate the variance in mean squared pairwise distance (an estimator of mutation rate x population size) for samples of arbitrary size and show that this variance does not approach zero as the sample size increases. We can also use our method to study alleles at linked microsatellite loci. We suggest at metric which quantifies the level of association between loci effectively a measure of linkage disequilibrium. It is shown that there can be linkage disequilibrium between partially linked loci at mutation drift equilibrium.},

	abstract = {The gene genealogy is derived for a rare allele that is descended from a mutant ancestor that arose at a fixed time in the past. Following Thompson (1976, Amer. J. Human Genet. 28, 442-452), the fractional linear branching process is used as a model of the demography of a rare allele. The model does not require the total population size to be constant or the mutant class to be neutral; so long as individuals in the class are selectively equivalent, the class as a whole may have a selective advantage, or disadvantage, relative to other alleles in the population. An exact result is given for the joint probability distribution of the coalescence times among a sample of alleles descended from the mutant. A method is described for rapidly simulating these coalescence times. The relationship between the genealogical structure of a discrete generation branching process and a continuous generation birth-death process is elucidated. The theory may be applied to the problem of estimating the ages of rare nonrecurrent mutations.},

	abstract = {The geographical spread of an initially localized population of farmers into a region occupied by hunter-gatherers is modelled as a reaction diffusion process in an infinite linear habitat. Hunter-gatherers who come in contact with farmers are converted at rate e. Growth of initial farmers, converted farmers, and hunter-gatherers is logistic with intrinsic rates r(f), r(c), and r(h). The carrying capacities of all farmers (i.e., initial and converted farmers combined) and hunter-gatherers are K and L. Individuals migrate at random, where the diffusion constant, D, is the same for all three groups. Under the above assumptions, we deduce the conditions under which wavefronts of initial or converted farmers are generated. Numerical work suggests that a travelling wave solution of constant shape always exists, comprising an advancing wavefront of all farmers and a retreating wavefront of hunter-gatherers. Linear analysis in phase space suggests that the speed is given by 2(Dr(f))(1/2) or 2[D(r(c) + eL)](1/2), whichever is greater. The composition of the expanding distribution of all farmers appears to depend on the relative magnitude of r(f) versus r(c) + eL and of eK versus r(h). A wavefront of initial farmers is not generated if r(f) < r(c) + eL. In this case, the initial farmers disappear completely if eK < r(h), whereas they spread mainly by diffusion behind the wavefront of converted farmers if eK > r(h). On the other hand, a wavefront of initial farmers is generated if r(f) > r(c) + eL. In this case, the waveform is peaked with leading and trailing edges that converge to 0 if eK < r(h), while it is flat behind the wavefront if eK > r(h) so that there is substantial displacement of the indigenous hunter-gatherers by the initial farmers.},

	abstract = {Complex life cycles are life histories in which abrupt ontogenetic transformations and niche shifts occur at the transition between stages. The effects of this niche differentiation between stages on coexistence between species are investigated using a simple discrete model of two-stage populations. The model incorporates exploitation competition for limiting resources within stages, between stages, and between species. While species with simple life cycles can never coexist at equilibrium, stable coexistence is shown to be possible between species with complex life cycles provided that (1) one species is more efficient in resource utilization at low resource abundance in the larval stage while the other is more efficient at low resource abundance in the adult stage; and (2) each species is mainly limited by that stage which is less efficient at low resource abundance. Stable coexistence is somewhat easier between a species with a simple life cycle and one with a complex life cycle. It requires that (1) the species with the simple life cycle should not be decidedly more efficient than that with the complex life cycle in utilizing the resource on which it lives; and (2) the main resource limitation for the species with a complex life cycle should occur in that stage which escapes competition with the species with a simple life cycle. Lastly, a complex life cycle can offer a decisive competitive superiority over a simple life cycle in interspecific competition, which suggests that competition can be a driving force of the evolution of complex life cycles. © 1994 Academic Press Inc.},

Since the models can explicitly incorporate various hypotheses about population dynamics and the nature and strength of interactions between species they permit a detailed analysis of how these hypotheses should affect community structure.

	abstract = {Environmental fluctuation between generations can lead to mixed optimal strategies (so-called bet-hedging). Due to mathematical intractability, however, optimality modelling has up to now largely ignored the effects of such fluctuations. The cases that have been considered so far are relatively simple. We show that the optimal strategy can be calculated explicitly for the case of non-structured populations. an environmental parameter which varies over generations according to an ergodic process and certain types of payoff functions (specifying the relationship between an individual′s trait value, the environment, and its expected contribution to the populations size in the next generation). Our results also lead to numerical solutions for other cases. Situations with and without information about the environment are considered. In both cases, there is a minimum environmental variability above which mixed strategies are optimal. Examination of the differences between long-term reproductive success of constrained purr strategies and optimal mixed strategies indicates that there is a high selection pressure for mixed strategies to evolve unless individuals can acquire highly accurate information about their environment. We show that the solution is robust in the sense that it has near to optimal long-term reproductive success under small perturbations of the payoff function and/or the distribution of the environmental parameter. © 1995 Academic Press.

The outcome of selection can be described by the selected proportion of individuals, the genetic gain, and the effective family number. There exists an optimal selection procedure, resulting in optimal family contributions, which maximizes genetic gain at a given selected proportion and minimum effective number. Numerical analyses were made for large normally distributed populations over a range of heritabilities, selected proportions, and effective numbers. Numerical results concerning the relationship between gain and effective number, heritability, breeding strategy, and family type (half- or full-sib) were discussed. Linear deployment, where family contributions are linearly related to the family average values, is an approximation to optimal selection, which is simpler to compute. Linear deployment was shown to function well as an approximation of optimal selection over a wide range of values of selected proportion, effective number, and heritability. For some special cases the linear deployment is optimal. © 1995 Academic Press. All rights reserved.},

We thus derive general insights into the influence exerted by individual energetic and allocation strategies on population average demographic characteristics. We show that models of individual energetics which produce apparently very similar predictions at the individual level can result in very different behaviour at the population level. In addition, we observe that different models of individual mortality can imply marked differences in population demography and that the assumption of constant mortality can be responsible for potentially unrealistic model behaviour. Our results emphasise the substantial data requirements for parameterising and testing individual- based models.},

	abstract = {A continent-island model is studied in which differences are initially present at a gene locus with assortative mating (which causes prezygotic reproductive isolation) and at one or two unlinked selected loci, (which cause zygotic reproductive isolation). This model simulates secondary contact between two populations which have diverged allopatrically at loci which control isolating mechanisms. Two different models of prezygotic isolation and three different models of zygotic isolation are studied. The analysis is focused on those conditions under which differentiation is not lost through the swamping effect of gene now. In each case the critical migration rate (mc) below which differences can be maintained is found. Results depend on the degree of assortative mating, on the level of selection on the genes involved, and on the particular models of reproductive isolation considered. However, in all the models, for high values of such parameters the two isolating mechanisms interact strongly, and consequently the stability of the difference at each locus (as measured by mc) is noticeably influenced by the presence of the difference at the other locus (or loci). The nature and strength of the effects of this interaction differ according to whether or not there is selection on the assortative mating locus and whether selection against hybrids or directional selection is hypothesized. © 1995 Academic Press.

	abstract = {With the acquisition of genetic, physical, and sequence maps, linkage relationships among genes (markers) may be more accurately approached in terms of global models for the distribution of recombination events that take into account interference. There are two principal analytical methods used for ascertaining linkage relationships. The first method, the Haldane-Kosambi differential equation approach, has the limitation that all of its calculations rest on consideration of only three gene markers, where recombination depends only on the physical distance between markers. In this formulation the resulting map function is in general not feasible for use with multiple markers. The second method starts with a model of the crossover process from which recombination values are determined. The best studied global recombination processes are based on sequential (renewal) crossover formation processes, the count-location crossover structure, and crossovers evolving by a cascade mechanism. This paper, containing both review and new results, concentrates on two aspects of recombination structures: (i) classifications and characterizations of multimarker crossover distributions; and (ii) analysis of regular and higher order crossover interference forms. In eucaryotic species, the general impression is that positive interference prevails, while in procaryotic and viral organisms, there may be circumstances of negative interference. We would propose in estimating the crossover formation process a binomial count distribution or any other count distribution satisfying property (a) of Theorem 9.1 and a location distribution fitted by the data. It is also reasonable to try one or more obligate crossover points superimposed on independent Poisson processes determining other crossover points. This latter model also generates a situation of positive interference (Theorem 3.1). © 1994 Academic Press. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {A set of two-locus descent measures are derived for loci on sex-linked and autosomal loci, with a population structure which includes finite population size, migration, and extinction and recolonization. Two-locus descent measures which involve sex chromosomes increase much faster with inbreeding than those for autosomes. For loose recombination, the two-locus descent measures are shown to be closely approximated by the product of the appropriate one-locus measures. The distribution and partitioning of variance within and among populations is derived, including additive-by-additive epistatic genetic variance. The variance among populations available to group selection is much higher in the homogametic sex with epistasis involving sex chromosomes or haplodiploids. The amount of additive genetic variance within populations due to sex chromosomes or haplodiploids can be significantly increased as a result of population bottlenecks and the conversion of epistatic genetic variance. The proportion of epistatic genetic variance which is converted to additive variance is greater in the homogametic sex than in the heterogametic sex, by as much as a factor of 2. © 1995 Academic Press.

We apply these four approaches to three examples of species interactions in spatially distributed populations and compare their predictions. Each represents different assumptions about the biology and hence a comparison among them has biological as well as modeling implications. In the first case all four approaches agree, in the second the spatial models disagree with the nonspatial ones, while in the third the stochastic models with discrete individuals disagree with the ones based on differential equations. We show further that the limiting reaction-diffusion equations associated with particle systems can have different qualitative behavior from those obtained by simply adding diffusion terms to mean field equations. © 1994 Academic Press.

It is shown that the coevolutionary theories in the literature that combine ecology with genetic viability selection are part of this extended theory and that the dynamic stability resulting from a separation of ecological and evolutionary processes actually follows from game theoretic solution concepts. The main focus of the paper is to investigate the application of the ESS (evolutionarily stable strategy) solution concept to dynamic stability when fitnesses are given by random interactions between individuals as opposed to viability selection. For two-species frequency- dependent interactions, the ESS criterion that implies stability asserts that, in any system near the ESS, at least one of the species is better off (i.e., more fit) if it evolves towards the ESS. The global stability of a polymorphic two-species ESS that is shown for two-species matrix gaines gives a powerful tool to predict the course of evolution through static fitness comparisons.},

	abstract = {A phenological segregation model of forest tree dynamics is studied, which has previously proposed to explain the observed gradient of species diversity along the length of an unfavorable season (e.g., winter or dry months). The assumptions are: the coexistence of many species in a tropical rain forest is based on lottery corn petition. With gap formation occurring throughout the year, a season unfavorable for growth causes a peak regeneration opportunity in the beginning of the growing season. The synchronization of the regeneration opportunity jeopardizes the coexistence of many similar species. The model has the globally stable equilibrium, where the curve of regeneration opportunity is best matches by a weighted average of regeneration ability (or niche) curves calculated using the species composition. If the candidate species have the same niche width and different peak dates, the remaining community includes several distinct groups of species with a similar peak regeneration date. If the candidate species differ also in niche width, the equilibrium community includes broad niche species with the peak in the middle of the growing season and narrow niche species with the peak either in the beginning or in the end of the growing season.},

	abstract = {We investigate the persistence of a population composed of socially interacting individuals living in a lattice structured habitat and the effect of spatially limited social interaction, reproduction, and migration. Both cooperative interaction (enhancing the survivorship of neighboring individuals) and competitive interaction (reducing it) are examined. Mathematical analysis based on pair approximation (or doublet decoupling approximation) and computer simulation are used. Results are: If migration rate is not very large, the population tends to form clusters of individuals (clumped distribution) due to spatially limited reproduction. Although cooperative interaction is more effective in a spatially structured population, the population is more difficult to persist than in the corresponding population without spatial structure, because the shortage of nearest neighbor vacant sites reduces reproduction. Migration of individuals reduces the clumping of the spatial pattern. Pair approximation predicts the equilibrium density fairly accurately when the predicted density is sufficiently high (i.e., more than 40% sites are occupied). If the predicted density is low however, the pair approximation overestimates the equilibrium population level. To overcome this disagreement, we examined improved pair approximation. © 1995 Academic Press. All rights reserved.},

In general recovery increases both the threshold density and the equilibrium density but does not alter the prevalence of infection or the region in parameter space in which the host is regulated. Immunity causes a further increase in the equilibrium density, does not alter either the prevalence of infection or the threshold density, but reduces the region in which there is regulation.

We present an example consistent with this mechanism, compare SSQ with mechanisms based on diapause, and propose some testable hypotheses.

	abstract = {A puzzling phenomenon in insect oviposition is the variety of egg distributions over plants. A clumped distribution can cause food competition among the offspring, and consequently risky migration to other plants. On the other hand, egg clumping can initially be advantageous. To examine under which conditions egg clumping is optimal, we studied the optimal distribution of eggs within a patch. A three-step model is proposed, representing hatching and initial growth of the larvae, migration and pupation. Assuming that egg clumping is advantageous in the first step, but disadvantageous in the subsequent steps, we analyze the trade-off between these effects. Five factors are investigated to see if they can contribute towards egg clumping: (1) size of egg supply; (2) number of plants per patch; (3) number of patches; (4) competition between insects; (5) small stochastic fluctuations in patch quality. Our results show that (1), (2), and (3) can contribute towards egg clumping, but (5) cannot. As an example, the model is applied to the cinnabar moth. We show that only (2) and (3) contribute towards the clumped egg distribution of the moth. © 1993 Academic Press.},

	abstract = {Crossover events along chromosomes do not occur independently, but influence the probably of other nearby events. The most common interaction between nearby crossover events is inhibitory: a crossover event tends to reduce the probability of other such events nearby, and this is called positive interference. A crossover event may increase the probability of events nearby, and this rare phenomenon is called negative interference. In this paper, we use numerical methods to investigate how interference among three loci would evolve if it were under the genetic control of a fourth, selectively neutral locus. We first discuss the effect of interference on the overall rate of recombination among the three loci, and then show that, under a variety of conditions, interference evolves in the same way as would be predicted based upon its effect on the overall rate of recombination. That is, the overall rate evolves in the same direction as would the rate at a locus that controls recombinalion between two loci directly. We then check for the existence of viability-analogous Hardy-Weinberg equilibria in the four-locus model of interference modification. © 1993 Academic Press.},

Emphasis is placed on the nearly neutral theory, as this version of the neutral theory has explained the widest range of phenomena. The shift of interest from protein to DNA evolution is chronicled, leading to the modern view that silent and replacement substitutions are responding to different evolutionary forces. However, the exact nature and magnitude of these forces remains controversial, as all current theoretical models suffer either from assumptions that are not quite realistic or from an inability to account readily for all phenomena. Although the gathering of sequence data has been the main effort of contemporary population genetics, further exploration of theoretical models of molecular evolution would provide a more coherent framework for data analysis. © 1996 Academic Press, Inc.},

	abstract = {Genetic damage is a fundamental problem for living systems. Recombination can repair a damaged gene, so long as there is an undamaged copy of the gene available in the cell. This requires that the cell be diploid for the damaged locus. During sex, outcrossing generates the diploid state by temporarily fusing two haploid cells (as in the case of meiosis) or by bringing DNA into the cell from outside (as in the case of bacterial transformation). But why should cells alternate between the haploid and diploid states in the first place? Why not just remain diploid, if damage repair is the only problem for a cell? The goal of our work is to understand if the problem of genetic damage would select for diploidy or for the alternation between diploid and haploid states-that is, sex-early in the history of life. Using mathematical models we study competition between asexual haploids (termed “haploids”), sexuals (termed “sexuals”), and asexual diploids (termed “diploids”). Haploid cells are efficient replicators, while diploid cells are resistant to damage. A sexual may combine the advantages of both: spending much of its life cycle in the haploid state, then temporarily fusing to become diploid, followed by splitting to the haploid state. During the diploid state DNA damage can be repaired, since there are two copies of the gene in the cell and one copy is presumed to be undamaged. We describe the competition in terms of mathematical models, employing five rate parameters which represent the life processes of cells most probably active at the time that sexuality arose: birth and death; genomic damage (for the haploids alone); and, for the sexual cell, fusion and splitting. Parameter space bifurcation diagrams for the equilibria are drawn in the three-dimensional space of damage, splitting, and fusion, and solutions of the equations (i.e., the outcomes of the competition) are described in terms of them. It turns out that those three parameters suffice to give an essentially complete description of the qualitative behavior possible, since one parameter can be scaled out of the equations we ultimately consider, and the other permits generic analysis, for the range of parameter values of interest, at a fixed value of that parameter. Each type of cell has a region of the parameter space that it occupies exclusively (given its initial presence in the competition). The haploid can win only in environments characterized by low damage (relative to mortality), while the diploid can win only in environments characterized by high damage (relative to mortality). However, the sexual may outcompete either of the asexuals in those domains assuming that the parameters of the sexual cycle are adjusted appropriately. In general, only a single type of cell occupies a given portion of the space. We find, however, that the competitive coexistence of a diploid and a sexual is possible in spite of the fact that they are competing for a single resource (nucleotide building blocks). This coexistence is the result of an overactive sexual cycle and so would presumably be selected against. © 1995 Academic Press. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The profitability of any foraging strategy may be in part dependent on the number of foragers adopting it, find so it can be viewed mathematically as a 'game.' We explore here the implications of a game-theoretic model of pollinators foraging on a mixed array of two flower species, with individual pollinators either specializing on one or the others or else acting as generalists. We further allow for the possibility of specialist advantages in foraging efficiency. The predicted mixture of pollinator behavioral strategies depends on the overall floral density and the relative densities of the two flower species. Where floral resources are scarce, pollinators should behave as generalists whereas When resources are superabundant, specialization on the single most profitable flower type (all else being equal, the commonest one) is favored. At intermediate floral densities, a mix of floral specializations (floral constancy) is favored, so long as the rarer flower's density dues not fall below some critical minimum level. Where the rarer flower is ton rare, a mixture of generalist and common- species specialists is favored. Rare flowers are at a reproductive disadvantage in all cases, but their relative success is highest where their pollinators are flower constant.},

Numbers of male and female progeny were considered binomially distributed with the following parameters: the total number of progeny (T) and production rate of males (r, strategic parameter). The total number of progeny may be limited, and the progeny numbers may be differ among females by a stochastic factor. It was assumed that the total number of progeny (T) for all females follows an identical probability mass function. When the total number of progeny (T) is limited, the optimum production rate of males (r) is higher than that predicted by Hamilton′s classical LMC model, which answers no stochasticity in the sex ratio. As the total number of progeny becomes large, the discrepancy between the stochastic model and Hamilton′s model decays. Another stochastic factor also affects the optimum production rate of males (r). A female that colonizes in a group cannot always have precise information on the number of co-foundresses in her group. When the number of co-foundresses in the group is obscure, the optimal production rate of males (r) is lower than that for the exact information. © 1993 Academic Press. All rights reserved.},

If the deleterious effect is large, the predicted genetic variance is notably smaller than the equilibrium genetic variance predicted by the mutation selection balance model with the rare-alleles approximation. The model further suggests that the ratio of the equilibrium genetic variance to the variance of allelic effects of new mutations is proportional to the ratio of total mutation load to the net selection coefficient on new mutations. It is also suggested that the net selection coefficient is equal to the per-generation proportional increment of genetic variance by new mutations.},

Conversely, different distributions of progeny number are contrasted under both random mating and half-sib mating. Both the mating system and the progeny distribution are significant determinants of genetic identity, but sometimes these factors are interrelated so that causality cannot be assigned to either factor.

	abstract = {In recent years regulations have been developed to address the risks of releasing genetically engineered organisms into the natural environment. These risks are generally considered to be proportional to the exposure multiplied by the hazard. Exposure is, in part, determined by the spatial spread of the organisms, a component of risk suited to mathematical analysis. In this paper we examine a mathematical model describing the spread of organisms introduced into a hetereogeneous environment, focusing on the risk of spread and plausibility of containment strategies. Two competing populations are assumed, one the natural species and the other an engineered species or strain, both of which move randomly in a spatially heterogenous environment consisting of alternating favourable and unfavourable patches. The classical Lotka-Volterra competition model with diffusion is used. Analyses of the possible spread and invasion of engineered organisms are thus reduced to finding periodic travelling wave solutions to the model equations. We focus on whether a very small number of engineered organisms can spatially invade a natural population. Initially we investigate the problem for spatially periodic diffusion coefficients and demonstrate that, under the right circumstances and a large enough unfavourable patch, invasion does not succeed. However, if spatially periodic carrying capacities are assumed along with spatially varying diffusion rates, the situation is far more complex. In this case containment of the engineered species is no longer only a simple function of the unfavourable patch length. By using perturbation solutions to the nonuniform steady states, approximate invasion conditions are obtained.},

These selective factors operated on sexual and asexual haploid and diploid populations that were reproductively isolated from one another. We concluded, in part, that a sexual type of cell could not expand from extreme rarity in populations dominated by asexual haploid and diploid cells. In the present paper we show that it is relatively easy for a rare sexual mutant to expand in a population dominated by asexual haploid cells if some matings occur between sexual and asexual cell types. We also study the persistence of sex in high mortality, high damage environments, in which neither the asexual diploid nor haploid can survive. The diploid cannot survive because its lower birth rate cannot overcome mortality and the haploid cannot survive because its birth rate cannot overcome gene damage. Sex can persist in these punishing environments by tuning the parameters of the sexual cycle, and the fusion and splitting rates, into a specified region, thereby reaping both benefits of damage repair and efficient replication. © 1995 Academic Press.

	abstract = {Using for each genotype an SIR-type model of disease transmission dynamics, we describe natural selection in a continuously breeding diploid host whose disease susceptibility and resistance are carried at one locus with two alleles. The system is transformed into variables that for each disease class describe the number of individuals, the gene frequency, and the deviation from Hardy-Weinberg proportions as measured by Wright’s fixation index. An assumption of small variation in disease response among genotypes (slow selection) separates the system to first-order into three blocks. One block describes the population-wide disease dynamics, the second considers the fixation index in each class, and the third block provides the change in gene frequencies. The first two blocks settle to equilibrium at a rate determined by the population turnover time while the last block after a while is dominated by a slowly changing variable, the average gene frequency. The dynamics of the gene frequency take the usual form for a continuous time slow selection model, and this provides explicit, epidemiologically justified expressions for the genotypic fitnesses. We apply the method to other disease transmission patterns (SEI and SIS) and discuss how suitable time averages extend our results to diseases with temporally varying incidence. © 1993 Academic Press, inc.},

A general solution for the model is presented, and special attention is given to the process of convergence to stability and its relationship to spatial population momentum. The constant ultimate level of the speed of convergence, or the intrinsic force of convergence, is found to be twice the difference between the two eigenvalues of the model′s transition matrix. Spatial population momentum is shown to be directly proportional to the initial growth rate of the population under the stationary rates and inversely proportional to the intrinsic force of convergence. A population increases in size during the transition to zero growth only when the faster growing state is a larger fraction of the initial population than of the stationary population. Hypothetical calculations with an urban/rural population model illustrate the importance of the speed of convergence, and show the great growth potential inherent in spatial momentum. © 1993 Academic Press.

	abstract = {What dispersal strategy should be employed by an organism in response to local catastrophic mortality? Here we contrast predictions from an analytical solution derived from an ESS model which optimizes competitive ability (Comins et al., 1980) with those from a stochastic, branching process model (Karlson and Taylor, 1992) which maximizes survivorship of a clonal lineage. The optimal dispersal fraction varies directly with the probability of local extinction in the ESS model, yet varies inversely with this probability over much of the parameter space in the latter model. In order to conform more closely with the assumptions of the ESS model, we have modified the branching process model to have a random, Poisson-distributed number of offspring and compared the predictions of these models. Both models invoke dispersal as an escape from local extinction and predict mixed dispersal strategies over a wide range of conditions. However, increasing local catastrophic mortality favors more dispersal in the ESS model, but it can be so severe in the branching process model that no dispersal strategy is adaptive. In this model, the predicted optimal proportion of dispersed offspring is highest at low to intermediate levels of catastrophic mortality depending on the total number of offspring produced. We suggest that this observed discrepancy is sufficiently large to warrant empirical tests of these qualitatively different predictions. © 1995 Academic Press. All rights reserved.},

We assume that a large herd size confers to the animals a high level of protection against predators, but reduces the amount of food which can be eaten by each individual; on the contrary animals belonging to small herds would have access to large amounts of food but would bear a high risk of being killed by predators. Employing a dynamic programming approach we analyze the optimal trade-off between starvation and predation risks under the hypothesis that the animals would try to maximize their expected reproductive fitness during the incoming breeding period. We compare the optimal strategy in environments described by different kinds of stochastic food distributions (including the deterministic limit) for different values of predation pressure and of overall food availability. We obtain general information about the effect of the level of randomness of food distribution on the mean individual fitness and on the number of reproducers (the animals which survive to the beginning of the reproductive season). Moreover we discuss how a certain number of behavioral and ecological processes-which have been often described in natural populations of ungulates and which are usually explained in terms of phenological variations of the ecological landscape-may be interpreted as caused by intrinsic variations of the animals′ strategy. © 1994 Academic Press.

Since then models have been developed to improve the accuracy of phylogenetic inferences based on amino acid or DNA sequences. Most of these models were designed to yield distance measures that are linear with time, on average. The reliability of phylogenetic reconstruction, however, depends on the variance of the distance measure in addition to its expectation. In this paper we show how the method of generalized least squares can be used to combine data types, each most informative at different points in time, into a single distance measure. This measure reconstructs phylogenies more accurately than existing non-likelihood distance measures. We illustrate the approach for a two-rate mutation model and demonstrate that its application provides more accurate phylogenetic reconstruction than do currently available analytical distance measures. © 1994 Academic Press.},

Increased anti-predator ability is assumed to require decreased food intake. The anti-predator ability is specified by the value of a continuous trait, whose evolutionary dynamics are determined by the rate of change of fitness as a function of the trait value. This situation can produce a perpetual evolutionary increase in the anti-predator trait, with a concomitant decrease in foraging (or other fitness-enhancing activities); the end result of the process is often extinction of the prey species. This outcome is most likely if the predator population size is maintained by some alternative prey species. Conditions that can promote or counteract this tendency toward self-extinction are discussed. © 1994 Academic Press.},

	abstract = {This paper concisely reviews the mathematical properties of the dominant Lyapunov exponent of a matrix sequence in the context of population biology. The concept of Lyapunov exponent provides a valuable tool for investigating processes of invasion in ecology or genetics, which are crucial in shaping community diversity, determining the spread of epidemics or the fixation of a new mutation. The appeal of the invasibility criterion based on the dominant Lyapunov exponent lies in the opportunity it offers to deal with population structure, complex life cycles, and complex population dynamics resulting from the model nonlinearities (oscillations, chaos), as well as random fluctuations arising from a stochastic environment. We put emphasis on the issues of the existence, numerical approximation, and regularity of the dominant Lyapunov exponent. Our presentation is aimed at showing that, despite our inability to compute the exponent analytically, which adds to its high intrinsic instability, important biological insights can nevertheless be achieved at the cost of fairly mild assumptions on the features of the models considered. © 1995 Academic Press.

This method yields broad conclusions that are independent of the details of a model. It is used here to show that mechanisms of coexistence and competitive exclusion are largely restricted to three broad categories. One of these categories includes classical mechanisms that do not depend on fluctuations over time. Another category includes mechanisms which may be referred to collectively as the storage effect. These mechanisms involve species-specific responses to environmental fluctuations, a relationship between fluctuations in competition and fluctuations in the environment, and an interaction between environment and competition. The final category depends on fluctuating competition and nonlinear responses to competition that differ between species. These general results are illustrated with analyses of several specific models, including a Lotka-Volterra model, a model of nonlinear resource consumption, and models of recruitment fluctuations for iteroparous organisms and for annual plants. © 1994 Academic Press.

The theory requires estimation of demographic birth and death rates, rates of catastrophes, and distribution of deaths when catastrophes occur. The colonization probability (chance of successful immigration), mean extinction time, and the long time conditional distribution of population size are predicted. The results can be put into algorithmic form so that workers can concentrate on developing parameters from empirical data. In the second part, the results are compared to the exact solution of a model (due to MacArthur and Wilson) without catastrophes and shown to be extremely accurate. The MacArthur-Wilson model is then extended to include environmental catastrophes. Finally, a metapopulation model with linear birth and death rates, immigration, catastrophes occurring at a rate independent of population size, and individuals dying independently is proposed. © 1993 Academic Press.},

In this paper, we study the FPTD For a stochastic model of density-independent population growth which includes a hard upper limit to population size. We discuss the conditions under which this distribution may be approximated by the FPTD of a Wiener process with a reflecting boundary condition, for which an exact calculation is presented in an appendix. We compare the FPTD of the new model with its counterpart in the model without an upper limit. The most important effects of introducing the upper limit are: (a) ultimate extinction becomes certain; (b) if the long run growth rate in the absence of the upper boundary was small but positive, extinction within ecologically significant times is likely; (c) for larger values of the long run growth rate, persistence over ecologically significant times is almost certain. We discuss the implications of result (b) for conservation. Result (c) establishes that “density-vague” regulation can produce persistent, but bounded, populations. © 1995 Academic Press.

	abstract = {In this paper we present a model in continuous time that allows us to analyse how an individual should allocate resources to growth and reproduction in order to maximize its lifetime contribution to future generations. Assuming that the death rate only depends on age, the allocation of energy is the solution of an optimization problem defined by a life history model. Making particular assumptions for the individual′s potential for growth and reproduction covering many situations of biological interest, the precise solution can be written up explicitely. Hence the effect of the various parameters may be analysed in detail. In general, the individual should first use all its energy to growth, then at a certain age invest a proportion of energy into reproduction. This fraction increases as the individual grow older. In some situations growth finally stops, while for other parameter values the individual continue to grow until it dies. This model was used to examine, for the von Bertanlanffy′s growth curve, the effects on age and size at maturity of changing the age-specific mortality rates. In general, the growth changes From a determinate growth to an indeterminate growth pattern when the mortality rate increases. In particular, a strong effect was found when the juvenile mortality increased. Rapid growth was also found to favour early maturation. © 1994 Academic Press. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we describe some regularities of the behavior of linkage disequilibrium, D, under temporal environmental fluctuations in infinite panmictic populations with non-overlapping generations and diploid and haploid selecton regimes. Different types of environmental variation ware considered. Our analysis shows that under two-locus haploid selection with any period length, there exists an environmental state (e.s.) where D can change the sign (between periods), but not more than once. The direction of this change is fully determined by a special quantity, “integral fitness disequilibrium coefficient,” Δ, which is calculated from genotypic fitness in environmental states. If Δ = 0, then two e.s. exist with only one change of the sign in each. Special types of environments (sub- or super-multiplicative) common in theoretical modelling can be mentioned where the sign of D between periods behaves rather simply for any considered e.s. It can be shown that under sufficiently small rates of recombination r < r* for any period length p in every e.s. the sign of D can change no more than once; the border r* is calculated as a function of fitness values which decreases with decreased differences between the fitnesses. The obtained results were applied to various types of fitness functions. Thus, cases of additive effects of fitness loci on the selected trait under various hypotheses about the selection regime in changing environment were considered in detail. In particular, we showed that the sign of D generated by selection is, in a sense, a nonsymmetrical function when one considers possible forms of fitness dependence on the selected trait: negative D′s are more probable. These results are also extended to the diploid case with an additively formed selected trait. © 1995 Academic Press. All rights reserved.},

The analysis is carried out with a continuation method for the study of the bifurcations of periodically forced continuous-time nonlinear systems. The large number of bifurcations of different types indicates that the dynamics of the model can be very complex. In fact, multiplicity of attractors, catastrophic transitions, subharmonics of various periods, cascades of period doublings, and strange attractors arise for suitable values of the parameters. The results are in agreement with the most recent theories on food chain systems and periodically forced predator-prey systems.

The model assumes a metapopulation consisting of a single source and 5 different sink populations and considers the expected number of nucleotide differences between two genes drawn at random from the source-sink metapopulation. The results show that a collection of interconnected sinks can maintain a substantial fraction of the genetic variability observed in the source population, particularly where migration from the source is continuous over time. The degree of genetic differentiation among the sinks might be large, especially if migration from the source is stochastic. Genetic differentiation is small when extinctions are frequent (because most of the sink populations are composed of recent migrants from the source) or extremely rare (because of the increased effect of migration among sinks), being maximized when the frequency of extinctions is between these two extremes. © 1996 Academic Press, Inc.},

	abstract = {Two unlinked autosomal loci are assumed to affect the ability to hear in such a way that homozygosity for the recessive allele at either locus causes deafness. The five deaf genotypes are subject to the same negative selection due to a lower likelihood of marriage, but unmarried deaf persons remain socially active and participate in the cultural transmission of sign languages. Marriages are assortative for deafness or for hearing, and mutation occurs irreversibly from the dominant to recessive allele at each locus at the same rate. At mutation-selection balance, the fully polymorphic equilibrium is symmetrical. Based on this genetic model, we consider the relative importance of various forms of cultural transmission as they affect the persistence of sign languages. Horizontal transmission is shown to be effective when deaf children are able to interact with many peers. This observation is especially pertinent if assortative meeting of deaf children occurs, for example, at schools for the deaf. Oblique transmission can also be effective, but the literature suggests that this kind of transmission plays only a minor role. It is necessary, however, that some form of cultural transmission occur between generations. Thus, vertical transmission is a critical factor, despite the fact that parent-child transmission is often interrupted due to the recessive inheritance of deafness. In particular, the contribution of vertical transmission is enhanced by assortative mating for deafness. © 1994 Academic Press.},

	abstract = {Using an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) model, it is shown that vertical transmission, defined as the direct transfer of infection from a parent host to its progeny, is an important factor which can urge reduction of parasite virulence. Evolution of the vertical transmission rate from both points of view, the parasite and the host, is analyzed. There is a critical level on the rate, below which an evolutionary conflict arises (the parasite would want to increase the rate while the host would not), and above which both sides would correspond to increase the rate. Therefore, once the parasite dominates the evolutionary race so as to overcome the critical level, the one-way evolution begins toward a highly mutualistic relationship with a high vertical transmission rate. The changes in other parameters may decrease the critical level, initiating the one-way evolution. However, changes in traits, probably developed through long interrelationship in parasitism, do not necessarily induce the evolution of mutualism. Establishment of the ability to make use of metabolic and digestive wastes from the partner certainly facilitates the evolution of mutualism, while improvements in reproductive efficiency of the parasites and reduction of negative effects from exploitation in hosts contrarily disturb mutualism. Finally, available data are discussed in the light of predictions of the model. © 1993 Academic Press. All rights reserved.},

We illustrate the model′s application to metapopulations by considering an example of malleefowl, Leipoa ocellata, in southern Australia, and calculate extinction probabilities and quasi-stationary distributions. We investigate the relative importance of modelling the particular arrangement of patches and the variation in patch sizes for this metapopulation and we use the model to examine the effects of further habitat loss on extinction probabilities. © 1995 Academic Press.

	abstract = {This paper describes how a parasite with distinct stages for replication within its host and for transmission among hosts should schedule the production of the two stages so that it achieves maximal transmission. A mathematical model of the within-host dynamics of a parasite and of its interactions with the immune response predicts that the optimal pattern of investment depends largely on the relationships between the growth rate of the parasite, the rate of increase of immunity against the parasite, and parasite-induced mortality of the host. We consider first a parasite with a constant, time-independent level of investment in transmission. If such a parasite grows rapidly and can therefore reach a density that kills the host before it is cleared by the immune response, it can achieve maximal transmission by producing transmission stages, and thus reducing its effective growth rate, to the extent that its peak density is just below the lethal density. This leads to the prediction that investment in transmission should be positively correlated with growth rate. In contrast, if the parasite grows more slowly and is cleared by the immune system before it can reach lethal density, the level of investment should be negatively correlated with growth rate. If a parasite can vary its investment into transmission during the course of infection, it should delay investment into transmission until it reaches lethal density or until shortly before it is cleared by the host′s immune system. If a parasite grows slowly in comparison with immunity, the optimal pattern of investment is a bang-bang pattern: the investment switches from total production of the replication stage to total production of the transmission stage shortly before the parasite is cleared by the immune response. If a parasite grows much more rapidly than immunity, the parasite initially replicates up to lethal density without producing any transmission stages, then produces transmission stages at the rate that reduces its effective growth rate to zero and thus allows it to be maintained at lethal density, and finally switches to complete investment into transmission stages shortly before it is cleared by the immune system. © 1995 Academic Press.

	abstract = {When resources are patchily distributed, animals have to decide when to leave a patch to find a new one. We model this leaving decision for any number n≥2 of animals per patch as a new version of the war of attrition. First, we consider a particular patch and assume that the animals get a fixed gain rate after leaving this patch. In this case, the optimal leaving strategy depends on whether or not there is interference. Without interference, ah animals should leave simultaneously according to the marginal value theorem. With interference, only n-K animals leave simultaneously, where K is a certain number independent of n, and the evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) of the remaining K animals is stochastic. As a consequence, they may leave at different times, and stay longer than is expected from the marginal value theorem. As the degree of interference increases more animals leave simultaneously, and the leaving tendency of the remaining ones increases as well. The only effect of increasing n is that more animals leave simultaneously. Finally, we discuss in a heuristic way how to use these results in case the gain rate that the animals get after leaving the patch is not fixed but depends on the leaving strategy that is used. When there is no interference, the generalization is straightforward. When there is interference, however, complications arise in deriving the ESS, since the presence of mutants may change the average gain rate in the habitat in such a way that mutants have an advantage over residents. This type of complication also occurs in other ESS derivations where local effects have a strong influence. © 1994 Academic Press. All rights reserved.},

The properties of three statistics were investigated: the sum of the squared distances between members of allelic classes, the sum of the root mean squared distances, and the sum of the squares of the numbers of alleles. The expectations of these quantities can be obtained analytically from both stepping-stone and branching diffusion models. The predictions of these two models are similar for wide ranges of parameter values and are consistent with the simulation results from a stepping-stone model. These results suggest that measures of the geographic distribution of alleles can be useful for estimating average dispersal distances at loci, such as minisatellite and microsatellite loci, at which mutation rates are high enough that they can be estimated with confidence. © 1993 Academic Press.

	abstract = {A statistical thermodynamic model of transcriptional regulation is employed to investigate the likely effects of genetic variation on the stabilization of gene expression. The model is tailored to empirical data on the control of transcription of the hunchback gene by the morphogen Bicoid during Drosophila embryogenesis. Variable parameters include the number of binding sites for activator protein and the DNA protein and protein protein cooperative binding energies. Recursions are performed to derive transcriptional response curves over a range of concentrations of activator. Sigmoidal responses are indicative of threshold-dependent activation of gene expression, and the effects of variation of the parameters on the width and location of the threshold are considered. It is shown that there is a minimum threshold width (maximum switch sensitivity) that is a function of the number of binding sites and the level of response desired, but independent of the binding energies. This places a constraint on the evolution of sensitive genetic switches that generate discrete cell types. Inevitable trade-offs between threshold widths and locations for multiple target genes of most transcriptional activators are found to occur. These naturally lead to epistatic and pleiotropic effects, and may favor the generation of networks of compensatory mutations that together produce homeostatic developmental pathways.},

A new result is the finding that two asymmetric equilibria with similar levels of linkage disequilibrium, but different gene frequencies, may arise in quite realistic biological models. The general, and most important, conclusion is that high levels of linkage disequilibrium may be generated by very small selective differences in cis and trans. Polymorphic sites that interact selectively are expected to show high levels of linkage disequilibrium. Conversely, if two polymorphic sites within a gene are found to be in linkage equilibrium, it is likely that one or both are selectively neutral. © 1995 Academic Press. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Optimal sex allocations under a population structure with local mate competition has been studied mainly in deterministic models that are based on the assumption of continuous clutch sizes. Hamilton's (1967) model is the classic example. When clutch sizes are small, however, this assumption is not appropriate. When taking the discrete nature of eggs into account it becomes critically important whether females control only the mean sex ratio ('binomial' females). As both types of sex ratio control have been found, it is of interest to investigate their evolutionary stability. In particular, it may be questioned whether perfect control of the sex ratio is always favoured by natural selection when mating groups are small. Models based on discrete clutch sizes are developed to determine evolutionarily stable (ES) sex ratios. It is predicted that when all females are of the binomial type they should produce a lower proportion of daughters than predicted by Hamilton's model, especially when clutch size and foundress number are small. When all females are of the precise type, the ES number of sons should generally be either a stable mixed strategy or a pure strategy, but there are special cases (for two foundresses and particular clutch sizes) where the ES number of sons lies in a trajectory of neutrally stable mixed strategies; the predicted mean sex ratios can be either higher or lower than predicted by Hamilton's model. The existence of ES mixed strategies implies that individuals females do not necessarily have to produce sex ratios with perfect precision: some level of imperfection can be tolerated (i.e., will not be selected against). When the population consists of both binomial and precise females, the latter always have a selective advantage. This advantage of precision does not disappear when precision approaches fixation in the population. The latter result contradicts the conclusions of Taylor and Sauer (1981) which is due to their way of expressing selective advantage; they define selective advantage as the between- generation increase per allele, which will always become vanishingly small when an allele reaches fixation, irrespective of fitness differences.},

In an asymmetric case in which the intrinsic growth rates and the competition coefficients of the two species are out of phase, a pair of stable coexistent periodic solutions are found. In each of four qualitatively different cases in the classical Lotka-Volterra system, an alternative possibility appears in a seasonal environment. Therefore, invasibility or stability of a boundary solution is insufficient to forecast the outcome of competition, and coexistence may be possible even when an invasion by a small number of individuals ends in failure. © 1993 Academic Press.

The resulting expressions can be used to place standard errors on estimates of population genetic parameters. The three measures considered are the average number of intrapopulation nucleotide differences, the average number of interpopulation nucleotide differences, and the net number of nucleotide differences between the two populations. The expectations of these statistics are previously known and suggest that they might be used to the quantify the divergence between populations. However, the standard errors of all three statistics are shown to be quite large relative to their expectations. Thus, our ability to quantify divergence between populations with them is limited, at least using available data. An analysis of mitochondrial DNA sequences from grey-crowned babblers illustrates the application of the theory. The variances derived here for migration are compared to previously published for two populations that have been completely isolated from one another for some length of time. All three variances are greater under migration than under isolation, suggesting that a test to distinguish these two demographic situations could be developed.},

	abstract = {Interspecific competition is usually thought or in terms of resource competition. Closely related species, however, may often compete also for a “sexual niche,” a sexual resource. Both sexual and resource competition are likely to affect the dynamics of closely related sympatric species. Here, a combined model of sexual and resource competition is developed and analyzed in terms of phase planes. Population dynamics involving sexual competition alone are characterized by competitive exclusion and dependence on relative initial population size of the competing species. This dependence on initial population size is due to the nonlinear equilibrium isoclines of sexual competition, which contrast with the linear isoclines of the Lotka-Volterra competition equations. Dependence on intial population size is stronger when sexual competition is severe and or when growth rates of the two species are low. Additional dynamic possibilities arise under combined sexual and resource competition. If the sexual competition is strong, competitive exclusion is the only outcome. But if sexual competition is weak, and if stable coexistence would occur without sexual competition, then both stable coexistence and competitive exclusion may occur simultaneously. A species that is relatively rare initially may be excluded, but when both species are initially of comparable abundance both will persist. Adding sexual competition to resource competition thus introduces additional uncertainty concerning the outcome of competition between two sympatric species. © 1994 Academic Press inc.},

	abstract = {In this paper we look at models for epidemics where the contact rate is a monotone increasing function of the population density. The background death rate also depends on the population density. We first examine the case of a constant contact rate (motivated by AIDS) and here obtain some global stability results. We consider an SIR model where a typical individual starts off susceptible, at some stage catches the disease and after a short infectious period becomes permanently immune. We also look at the effects of vaccination. First we perform an equilibrium and local stability analysis. Next we reformulate the model in terms of the proportions of individuals susceptible, infected, and immune to obtain some global stability results. We find three possible equilibrium values: one where the population is extinct, one where the disease has died out but the population has not died out, and a unique equilibrium where disease is present. We determine conditions for global stability of these equilibria. For certain parameter values none of these equilibria are locally stable. In this case there is a formal proportional endemic equilibrium with a strictly positive proportion of infected individuals. We expect the population size to die out but the proportions of susceptible, infected, and immune individuals to tend to this endemic proportional equilibrium. We find two critical contact rates which help determine the behaviour of the system. Next we extend some of these results to the case where the contact rate depends on population density. Finally the paper examines these results further using numerical methods. © 1995 Academic Press. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The mutational deterministic hypothesis postulates an advantage to sexual over asexual reproduction when mutation rates are on the order of 1.0 per genome per generation, provided that selection takes the form of a synergistic epistasis. While the efficacy of this mechanism has been investigated for infinite populations, its ability to protect sex in finite populations exhibiting stochastic dynamics remains untested. Stochastic processes have the potential to undermine protection for sex in two ways: (1) asexual lineages derived from sexual ancestors may, by chance, be founded by individuals bearing fewer than the equilibrium mean number of mutations, and (2) once established, such lineages will undergo random perturbations in the rates at which they grow and accumulate mutations. In the present study, I show using computer simulation that sexual populations of as many as 10,000 individuals are susceptible to invasion by asexual lineages for mutation rates higher than predicted under the mutational deterministic hypothesis. My simulations differ from previous investigations in that they model the progress of asexual lineages into sexual populations as both stochastic and deterministic processes for various mutation rates, selection regimes, and population sizes. It is suggested that ecological factors, such as parasitism or release from competition, could interact with selection against deleterious mutations to protect sex. To provide the sole explanation for sex, however, may require that selection against deleterious mutations be accompanied by mutation rates on the order of 2.0 per genome per generation. © 1994 Academic Press.

Four models with different patterns of colonization (number of colonists and place of origin of colonists) were studied by performing a large number of computer simulations with the Monte Carlo method for several sets of values of the following parameters: coefticient of selection against the heterozygote, extinction rate of each deme, deme size, and number of demes. The probability of the newly arisen rearrangement being established in the multi-deme system depends strongly on the pattern of colonization, other things being equal. In the three models in which there is absent or scarce mixing of gene pools of different demes when a new deme is founded, the fixation probability of the new chromosomal rearrangement is rather close to that calculated by R. Lande (1979, Evolution33, 234-25l; 1985, Heredity54, 323-332), which is equal to the corresponding probability in a single deme divided by the number of demes. In the model with extensive mixing of gene pools of demes. the corresponding probability is lower (considerably in some cases). Furthermore, in the models where the fixation probability is higher, the analysis of the time of the process leads to the conclusion that in systems consisting of a large number of demes, overlapping of several different processes of fixation of chromosomal rearrangements occurs. © 1993 Academic Press.},

Here we expand a previously developed evolutionary game theory, which can be used to predict ESSs in a large class of models, by introducing strategy dynamics. By so doing, a more complete description of the evolutionary process is obtained. One not only obtains a convenient way of determining evolutionarily stable strategies, but interesting features about the evolutionary process itself can be observed. of particular interest here, we show that the number of strategies which are evolutionarily stable can change as certain environmental factors involved with the model change. The process by which the ESS is formed is examined in terms of an “adaptive landscape” formed by our fitness generating function (G-function). The G-function has properties that enhance the likelihood that the various adaptive peaks will be occupied. © 1993 Academic Press.},

	abstract = {The evolutionary consequences of culturally transmitted practices that cause differential mortality between the sexes, thereby distorting the sex ratio (e.g., female infanticide and sex-selective abortion), are explored using dynamic models of gene-culture coevolution. We investigate how a preference for the sex of offspring may affect the selection of genes distorting the primary sex ratio. Sex-dependent differences in mortality have been predicted to select for a male- or female-biased primary sex ratio, to have no effect, or to favor either under different circumstances. We find that when a mating pair's behavior modifies mortality rates in favor of one sex, but does not change the number of offspring produced in the mating, the primary sex ratio will evolve a bias against the favored sex However, when the total number of offspring of a mating pair is significantly seduced as a consequence of their prejudice, the primary sex ratio will evolve to favor the preferred sex. These results hold irrespective of whether the sex ratio is distorted by the mother's, the father's or the individual's own autosomal genes. The use of dynamic models of gene-culture coevolution allows us to explore the evolution of alleles which distort the sex ratio, as well as the final equilibrium states of the system. Gene-culture interactions can provide equilibria different from those in purely genetic systems, slow the approach to these equilibria by orders of magnitude, and move the primary (PSR) and the adult sex ratio (ASR) away from any stable equilibrium for hundreds of generations. © 1994 Academic Press.

	abstract = {This paper contains a simple model for a chemostat with predator, prey, and periodically pulsed substrate. We obtain an exact periodic solution with positive concentrations of substrate and prey. A stability analysis for this solution yields an invasion threshold (the smallest value of the predator′s predation constant consistent with invasion of the chemostat). Above this threshold, there are periodic oscillations in substrate, prey, and predator. Simple cycles may give way to chaos in a cascade of period-doubling bifurcations despite the presence of severe statistical constraints on the behavior of the dependent variables. We determine the average substrate, bacterial, and protozoan concentrations for all periodic orbits, independent of the actual period. We conclude by comparing the behavior of this system with that of two other model chemostats. © 1993 Academic Press.},

	abstract = {An evolutionary theory of senescence at the level of whole clones is formulated. The theory is based on the assumption that the Malthusian parameter measures fitness. The clone is modelled as a group of independent ramets. Survival probabilities and reproductive capacities of the ramets are allowed to vary with both ramet age and the age of the clone. An expression defining fitness as a function of the life history parameters of ramets and formulas for the parameter elasticities are derived. They are used to show that the sensitivity of fitness with respect to perturbations of the life history parameters of ramets decreases towards zero with increasing clonal age at which the perturbations take place. Thus, the force of natural selection against genes with deleterious effects on ramet survival and reproduction decreases with increasing clonal age of gene effects. Clonal senescence may therefore evolve through the accumulation of such genes and genes with antagonistic pleiotropic effects, i.e., with positive effects early in the life of the clone but deleterious effects later. Further, one special case is analyzed where the performances of ramets are, initially, independent of the age of the clone. For this case, it is shown that the decrease in sensitivity with clonal age depends on the ramets′ timing and amount of sexual reproduction relative to their total reproductive capacities. The analysis shows that the differentiation of soma and germ is not required for the evolution of senescence. Rather, it is suggested that, besides the occurrence of genes coding for senescence, the only requirement is the presence of a rejuvenating form of reproduction. © 1995 Academic Press.

	abstract = {The typical freshwater algal community can be roughly categorised into two groups according to the distribution of biomass with cell size. Algae in the small size group are known to be edible for zooplankton grazers; large algae are much less edible. To model population dynamics of a size selective zoaplankton predator like Daphnia we thus consider a 3-species predator-prey model with an “edible” and an “inedible” prey. We show that a system which in the absence of inedible algae exhibits cyclic dynamics may exhibit a stable equilibrium if inedible algae are introduced. This stabilisation can be caused by one or both of the following mechanisms: (a) “indirect interaction” involving interspecific competition between the prey which reduces the effective carrying capacity of the edible species, and (b) “direct interaction” in which there is a reduction of the attack rate on the edible prey when the predator spends time handling inedibles. We study the behaviour of the system under enrichment. With only the indirect interaction, the equilibrium density of the edible prey is unaffected by enrichment, but the density of both inedible prey and predator increases. With sufficient enrichment the system can always be destabilised. If there is direct interaction, the equilibrium density of all three species increases with enrichment: the edible fraction decreases, but has a lower bound. If the direct interaction is sufficiently strong there are regions of parameter space for which the system can never be destabilised by enrichment. © 1993 Academic Press.},

	abstract = {The great majority of models of the population genetics of subdivided populations have made the simplifying assumption that the gene frequencies in migrant groups are deterministic. The present paper examines models which more closely mimic natural conditions, in which the gene frequencies in migrant groups are subject to stochastic effects. It is shown that some types of stochastic migration can cause dramatic changes in spatial correlations and variance. These changes depend on how the stochastic migration effects in the gene frequency recursion equations are shared among nearby subpopulations during the same generation. Only for cases where the effects are completely unshared are the equilibrium spatial and space-time correlations among adult subpopulations unaffected, but the variance is always inflated. The analyses here use novel methods, by recasting population genetic migration-drift models as space-time autoregressive moving average (STARMA) processes. Recent theorems for STARMA processes are employed for finding the spatial correlations, and for the first time in population genetics theory the complete set of space-time correlations, for systems with general patterns of migration rates and numbers of spatial dimensions. The space-time correlations provide a uniquely detailed description of a system, and thus form a link between observed spatial autocorrelation statistics and the underlying space-time population genetic process. STARMA theoretical processes have direct statistical analogues that can be applied for process identification, parameter estimation, model fitting, and forecasting in real systems. © 1994 Academic Press.

Equilibrium or disequilibrium only makes sense relative to some reference population of a species. If the loci all occur on the same chromosome, then linkage equilibrium holds provided a random representative of that chromosome from the reference population displays independent alleles at the various loci of the set. Classical deterministic population genetics theory shows that linkage equilibrium is approached asymptotically after many generations of random mating in a reference population of infinite size. The current paper considers a Markov chain model for the establishment of linkage equilibrium in a population of finite size. The states of this Markov chain correspond to counts of chromosomes of various types. Because the chain is reversible, the equilibrium distribution can be explicitly computed. Partial characterization of the geometric rate of convergence of the chain to equilibrium is possible using a strong stationary stopping time. © 1993 Academic Press. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {We have developed maximum likelihood (ML) methods for comparisons of nucleotide sequences from unlinked genomic regions. In the case of a single species, the ML method primarily estimates the effective population size (Ne) under both constant size and abrupt expansion conditions. In the case of two or three species, the ML method simultaneously estimates the species divergence time and the effective size of ancestral populations. This allows us to trace the evolutionary history of the human population over the past several million years (my). Available sequences at human autosomal loci indicate Ne= 10,000 in the Late Pleistocene, a figure concordant with the results obtained from mitochondrial DNA sequence and allele-frequency data analysis, and there is no indication of population expansion. The ML analysis of two species shows that humans diverged from chimpanzees 4.6 my ago and that the human and chimpanzee clade diverged from the gorilla 7.2 my ago. Furthermore, the effective population size of humans more than 4.6 my ago is nearly 10 times larger than Neof modern humans. The effective population size in the human lineage does not seem to have remained constant over the past several million pears. The ML model for three species predicts slightly different, but consistent results to those obtained by the two-species analysis. © 1995 Academic Press. All rights reserved.},

In this study we combine ecological and standard populations genetics in a haploid multilocus model that includes density-dependent regulation of population size and weak density-dependent differential selection among the multilocus genotypes. An allele that affects recombination among the genes contributing to the ecological selection, introduced near a stable equilibrium of the ecological-genetic system, invades if it reduces a weighted average of the recombination rates among pairs of loci under selection. This generalizes the Reduction Principle for the evolution of recombination (M. W. Feldman and U. Liberman, Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA83, 4824-4827, 1986; L. A. Zhivotovsky, W. M. Feldman, and F. B.

Analysis of the two disease case shows that the reduced model provides a very good approximation throughout the full dynamics for small alterations of susceptibility, and, after a transient error, a good approximation to the complete model when susceptibilities are highly enhanced.

In this paper a model is formulated in which the mating rate depends on both male and female density. Given the female presence curve, protandry is an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) for males. The evolutionary stable amount of protandry decreases with increasing death rate and decreasing encounter rate. Given the male presence curve, protandry also is an ESS for females. However, male and female ESS are not identical; moreover, in the present model a simultaneous ESS does not exist. Protandry critically depends on the assumption that females mate only once, whereas males are capable of multiple mating. If females too are capable of multiple mating, absence of protandry is the ESS for males as well as females. The model predicts that protandry depends on population density: protandry should be more pronounced in populations with high density than in populations with low density. Protandry also depends on sex ratio. It becomes more pronounced when the proportion of males among emerging adults increases. © 1991.},

	abstract = {The foraging success of top predators may be influenced by the shapes of their habitats. We show here that when a two-dimensional habitat is restricted to a narrow strip or a three-dimensional system to a thin plate, then searching predators must travel further between prey items. This result holds when the width of the strip or thickness of the plate is narrower than twice the perception range of the predator, and when prey are not particularly abundant. If, as would be expected, travel time and energy expenditure increase with distance travelled, restricting the dimensionality of a habitat will decrease the net energy gain of a predator per prey consumed. This in turn may affect the size of a predator population that a given habitat can support, and ultimately determine whether the top predator species is viable in the habitat. This mechanism provides one explanation for observed relationships between the lengths of food chains and habitat dimensionality. © 1992.},

Our approach is to use a partial differential equation model of dispersal and population growth, and then ask whether we can identify “rates of spread” for an invading organism subject to an Allee effect. Results indicate that an Allee effect may substantially reduce the rate at which the invader moves into a new environment. Analysis of spread in two spatial dimensions entails application of a singular perturbation theory approach. Here the two-dimensional spread velocity is given in terms of the one-dimensional asymptotic spread rate and the curvature of a boundary between invaded and non-invaded regions. Using this result, we show that invasions cannot propagate unless they initially exceed a critical area. This prediction is verified by numerically solving the original model. Numerical solutions are used throughout in demonstrating the nature of the two-dimensional spread. © 1993 Academic Press.},

Spatial instabilities are found that break the system into “asynchronous regions” that can stabilize the “global” populations. These spatial heterogeneities are determined to be the result of discretizing space, time, and the population. Agreement is found with analytic results for the non-spatial Lotka-Volterra model and the spatial Lolka-Volterra model with diffusion when the discretizations are scaled to zero. It is argued from an individual-based modelling perspective, however, that this limiting procedure is biologically untenable. The conclusion is that under an individual-based model formulation of the Lotka-Volterra system, spatially heterogeneous population distributions are allowed. The specific form of these spatial distributions are shown to be strongly dependent on the prey diffusion rate and the specifics of implementing individual stochasticity. © 1993 Academic Press.},

Yet for many organisms with limited dispersal abilities, it may be more reasonable to consider larger islands as comprised of an ensemble of local populations coupled by within-island dispersal. Conceptual arguments and a simple patch occupancy model are used to examine the potential relevance of such internal spatial dynamics in explaining area effects, expressed via the probability that a species is present per unit area as a function of total island area. The model suggests that strong area effects depend on a rather fine balance between local colonization and extinction rates. A fruitful direction of future research should be the application of patch dynamic theory to classic island biogeographic questions and systems. © 1992.},

We develop here two models to examine how interannual variability in parental provisioning, M (a function of the level of food in the environment), and the ability to assess M affect the brood reduction decisions of a senior sib in a brood of two chicks. Obligate execution is always favored by natural selection if M never exceeds mCRIT, the minimum level of M that, from the senior sib's perspective, is required to sustain both chicks. Obligate execution can be favored in a variable environment even if M exceeds mCRIT in most years because of the asymmetry in costs and benefits of levels of M below and above mCRIT. Execution will never be favored if M always exceeds mCRIT. If M varies around mCRIT, facultative execution will be favored when M can be assessed accurately, when the cost of assessment is low, and when the cost of an error is small. These costs arise from the possibility, due to sampling effects, that the senior sib arrives at an incorrect decision, killing its sib in good years, or more importantly, allowing it to live in a bad year. A senior sib must allow its junior sib to remain alive in order to derive information about the state of M (e.g., from the pattern of parental provisioning), but has the disadvantage that the senior sib must share food with the possible victim, which yields no payoff if the eventual verdict is execution. The results of a dynamic programming model suggest that early execution is favored, as the senior sib has the most to gain in future provisioning, and uncertainty about M is greatest. Increasing total provisioning through extension of the nestling period favors clemency. © 1992.},

Prey with low dispersal ability become narrowly confined to the most productive habitats, strongly amplifying the underlying spatial pattern of the environment. As prey diffusion rate increases, the prey distribution spreads out and predator abundance declines. The model retains neutrally stable Lotka-Volterra temporal dynamics: different scales of predator and prey dispersal do not stabilize the interaction.

Model versions comprising a single predator-prey pair are chararacterized by a time-invariant steady state. As soon as further pairs are added the system becomes instable, exhibiting first periodic and then chaotic oscillations. In spite of the chaotic dynamics, certain statistical trends are independent of the initial conditions chosen. The variability in global system variables (nutrient concentration, metabolic activity) decreases with increasing number of pairs, revealing thus an increase in the efficiency of nutrient utilization. In the non-equilibrium situation an unlimited number of differently sized predator-prey pairs may coexist, the time-averaged biomass being evenly distributed among all pairs. Such observations contrast with expectations derived from the steady state. © 1993 Academic Press. All rights reserved.},

The plant must decide whether to invest photosynthate to vegetative growth or to reproductive activity, based on the future resource level etimated using currently available information. The stochastic dynamic programming model is analyzed in two cases: (1)the environmental resource level jumps randomly between two levels, and (2) it fluctuates continuously following diffusion processes. The model predicts that the scheme of stochasticity to which the plant has been adapted greatly affects its growth reaction to a given resource level. If the plant is adapted to a slowly changing environment, it should continue to grow until late in a favorable environment but should start reproduction earlier in an unfavorable one, showing large phenotypic plasticity. In contrast, plants adapted to a quickly changing environment should use an almost fixed growth schedule, irrespective of the current level of the environmental resource supply. Consequently, a plant adapted to the environment with usualy low nutrient level with occasional short flushes of nutrient supply would not produce a large vegetative organ when placed in a nutrient rich environment. This explains the paradox of slow-growing plants. © 1991.},

	abstract = {Several hypotheses have been made to explain the forest decline due to acidic deposition. One of the most credited is the mobilization of toxic aluminium ions when soil pH falls below 4.2. A simple model is presented here that couples soil chemistry with tree biomass dynamics in order to investigate the influence of different proton loads on the existence, stability, and bifurcations of ecosystem equilibria. It is shown that, owing to the intrinsic nonlinear nature of the vegetation response to acid deposition, the equilibrium manifold can have, under certain conditions, the structure of a fold catastrophe. Increasing acidic load can thus drive the forest through a catastrophic transition from a viable equilibrium to extinction. Simulations using realistic ranges for model parameters and acidic input show that forests may indeed meet the conditions for a catastrophic collapse resulting from accumulation of acidic stress in the soil. © 1993 Academic Press.},

A new method is introduced to deal with the problem of grandparental transmission in which the basic variables are the frequencies of triplets comprising a mother, a father, and their daughter of permissible phenogenotypes. Usual stability analysis is then done on the system of linear recursions in the frequencies of these triplets, derived on the assumption that signers (users of the sign language) are rare.

	abstract = {The most commonly used statistical model to describe the rate constancy of molecular evolution (molecular clock) is a simple Poisson process in which the variance of the number of amino acid or nucleotide substitutions in a particular gene should be equal to the mean and henceforth the dispersion index, the ratio of the variance to the mean, should be equal to one. Recent sequence data, however, have shown that the substitutional process in molecular evolution is often considerably overdispersed and have called into question the generality of using a simple Poisson process. Several efforts have been made to develop more realistic models of molecular evolution. In this paper, I will show that the spatial (site-specific) variation in the rate of molecular evolution is an improbable cause of the overdispersion and then review various statistical models which take the temporal variation into account. Although these models do not immediately specify what the mechanisms of molecular evolution might be, they do make qualitatively different predictions and give some insight into their inference. One way to distinguish them is suggested. In addition, effects of selected substitutions that presumably occur after a major change in a molecule are quasi-quantitatively examined. It is most likely that the overdispersion of molecular clock is due either to a major molecular reconfiguration (fluctuating neutral space) led by a series of subliminal neutral changes or to selected substitutions fine-tuning a molecule after a major molecular change. Although the latter possibility, of course, violates the simplest neutrality assumption, it would not impair the neutral theory as a whole. © 1991.},

Often, these questions revolve around ways of mitigating the dangers posed by habitat fragmentation. Problems involving the scale of both animal movement and spatial heterogeneity inexorably arise when assessing the effects of fragmentation. We present results from a simple spatial model that simulates the dispersal of animals in a landscape of stochastically clustered habitat fragments. Varying the number of clusters and the spatial scale at which clustering occurs illustrates that heterogeneity has different and conflicting effects on animal movement when it occurs at different scales. Indeed, the scale of clustering is the most important feature in determining disperser performance in our model. Seeking to compare our modeling results with actual data, we review empirical studies of fragmented populations and habitats. Surprisingly, we conclude that very few studies have addressed the mechanisms by which fragmentation will influence population dynamics or, in particular, the ways in which spatial scale mediate these effects. We conclude that the explicit consideration of scale is essential in discussions of habitat fragmentation and of optimal conservation strategies. © 1992.},

The expectation of number of steps on random trees is derived for both types of data and the variance in number of steps is derived for missing-value data. It is conjectured that the number of steps on random trees for these data should be asymptotically normal. Computer simulation is used to find approximations for the expected number and variance in number of steps of minimum length trees for both types of random evolutionary data. In both cases, minimum length trees are shorter than random trees and, although the lengths diverge in number, they converge in proportion. The length of minimum length trees is frequently used to evaluate the goodness of the tree as a representation of the data and the goodness of the data for constructing a plausible hypothesis of evolutionary relationships. In turn, as the length of a minimum length tree increases, confidence in the resulting tree decreases. The distributions of lengths of minimum length trees are of interest to determine if any information on phylogenetic branching is present in the data. The expected length of random trees can be used as a measure to compare to the lengths of minimum length trees for real data sets. © 1993 Academic Press.},

	abstract = {This paper deals with the problem of relating physiological properties of individual organisms to the dynamics at the total population level. A general nonlinear matrix difference equation is described which accounts for the dynamics of stage-structured populations under the assumption that individuals in the populations can be placed into well defined descriptive stages. Density feedback is modeled through an assumption that (stage-specific) fertilities and transitions are proportional to a resource uptake functional which is dependent upon a total weighted population size. It is shown how, if stage-specific differences in mortality are insignificant compared to stage-specific differences in fertility and inter-stage transitions, a nonlinear version of the strong ergodic theorem of demography mathematically separates the population level dynamics from the dynamics of the stage distribution vector, which is shown to stabilize independently of the population level dynamics. The nonlinear dynamics at the population level are governed by a key parameter π that encapsulates the stage-specific parameters and thereby affords a means by which population level dynamics can be linked to properties of individual organisms. The method is applied to a community of stagestructured populations competing for a common limiting resource, and it is seen how the parameter π determines the competitively superior species. An example of size structured competitors illustrates how the method can relate the competitive success of a species to such size-specific properties as resource conversion efficiencies and allocation fractions for individual growth and reproduction, largest adult body size, and size at birth and maturation. © 1992.},

Our premises are that the deaf are more motivated to learn sign language than the hearing, and that a vertically transmitted sign language, unlike recessive hereditary deafness, cannot "jump a generation." Conditions are obtained for persistence (i.e., protection from loss) of signers. These conditions are more easily satisfied the greater the fraction of the hearing who also learn sign language and as the frequency of the recessive gene for deafness increases. Persistence is also facilitated by assortative mating for deafness, but not by assortment for signing. With vertical transmission only, it is necessary that one signer parent be able to transmit sign language with greater than one-half the efficiency of two. Under the assumption that the hearing do not learn sign language, the following additional results are obtained. Persistence is more likely with dominant as opposed to recessive inheritance. When recessive hereditary and acquired deafness co-occur, increasing the frequency of the latter has opposite effects depending on the degree of assortment. Opportunities for the deaf to learn sign language outside the family seem not to affect the conditions for persistence. © 1991.},

Temporal scale is habitat lifespan relative to the generation time of the organism, and spatial scale is the distance between habitat patches relative to the dispersal distance of the organism. A spatially explicit simulation model of population growth and dispersal was constructed for a population that is distributed on a grid. The grid contains two sorts of habitat, useable and nonuseable habitat; useable habitat occurs in habitat patches. Habitat patches are transient; they are "born" at random with a specified probability, and they exist for a specified length of time, the patch "lifespan." Distance between patches is directly related to habitat patch size when the fraction of the grid in useable habitat is held constant. A factorial simulation experiment was conducted in which the fraction of the grid in useable habitat was held constant and patch lifespan, patch size, and species dispersal distance were varied. The relative importance of temporal scale (patch lifespan) and spatial scale (patch size, a surrogate for inter-patch distance per species dispersal distance) on regional population size was tested by analysis of variance. Population size increased with increasing temporal scale and decreased with increasing spatial scale. The effect of temporal scale far outweighed the effect of spatial scale. Implications for design of ecological research programmes are discussed. © 1992.},

	abstract = {The problem is considered of whether natural selection favors genotypes characterized by oscillatory or chaotic population dynamics. This is done with reference to two simple one-dimensional models, which display a variety of dynamical patterns according to the different values of their parameters: the semelparous and iteroparous Ricker models. To lind the optimal genotype (or genotypes) within a given feasibility set, the concept of Continuously Stable Strategy (CSS) and a haploid model of competition between genotypes are used. The parameters subject to evolution are the intrinsic finite rate of increase and respectively the juvenile mortality in the semelparous model and the adult survival in the iteroparous one. In the semelparous case a single feasible CSS exists, while in the other case more than one CSS might exist. The dynamical nature of the optimal genotype (stable equilibrium, stable sustained oscillations or chaos) is basically determined by the shape of the set of feasibility for the parameters defining each genotype. However, if the feasibility set is drawn at random, the probability that the corresponding optimal genotype (or genotypes) be oscillatory or chaotic is quite low. This result, however, might not hold with more complex models. © 1993 Academic Press. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This study uses population dynamical models that explicitly incorporate mechanisms of competition and predation to examine trophic regulation in food chains containing plants, herbivores, and carnivores. The mechanisms include exploitative and interference competition for time and energy and time- and energylimited predation rates. The various mechanisms are combined in consumer and resource equations to explore how food chain structure varies across gradients of primary productivity. When consumers are limited by exploitative competition for energy, all trophic levels should exist over the entire productivity gradient. When consumers in one or more trophic levels are limited by feeding time and interference competition, there will be threshold levels of productivity before a trophic level can be added to the food chain. The value of the threshold will depend on the magnitude of consumer energy requirements relative to environmental productivity in an area. In all cases, consumer and resource densities should always increase as productivity increases. In general, top down control of food chain dynamics by carnivores, as opposed to bottom up control by nutrient inputs, will be most dominant over low to moderate productivity levels. I show that mechanistic models can produce a broader range of food chain dynamics than traditional Lotka-Volterra consumer-resource models. © 1992.},

Character states of two identical, competing species were determined by a single-gene, two-allele model. In each generation, the carrying capacity of different segments of a uniform resource spectrum fluctuated randomly. Inter- and intraspecific exploitation competition reduced fitnesses of similar genotypes. In contrast to demographic models of niche shift, this genetic model led to a high average overlap of species in a variable environment. However, for moderate or small environmental fluctuations, character distributions of the two species diverged significantly and rapidly. Results were nearly identical for a model of environmental fluctuations that incorporated resource "crunches." These models were sensitive to the intrinsic rate of increase of the competing species: divergence was substantially slower at small values of r. Nevertheless, most simulations of this simple genetic model suggest that interspecific competition can lead to significant divergence, even in a moderately fluctuating environment. © 1991.},

I argue that the conditions which lead to these diffusive instabilities are likely to be met in natural populations. Thus it is important to consider the interaction between age structure and spatial structure in both experimental and theoretical work. In particular, the conditions leading to chaos are more common than would be predicted in models which ignore structure. © 1992.},

These ecological, behavioral, and physiological characteristics that vary with body mass constitute the notion of allometric herbivory. In fractal landscapes, forage density varies with the scale at which animals perceive the resource. Interactions between scale-dependent resource density and allometric herbivory were investigated by using remotely sensed imagery to simulate fragmented distributions of forage biomass in an 810-ha landscape, and then simulating allometric herbivory for 2-6-kg animals. Between years, changes in landscape geometry altered foraging success. Within years, resource depletion resulted in increased aggregation among foragers followed by sudden increases in mobility and dispersion. Portions of the forage remained after the foragers shifted from the aggregation phase to one of mass dispersal. Spatial patterns of resources may regulate resource uptake and depletion rates within the landscape, with potential implications for demographics, intra-specific competition, and community assembly. © 1992.},

In our model, the net number of offspring produced per reproductive bout is expressed as an explicit function of fitness gained from reproduction and fitness lost due to starvation risk for different potential diets. Potential model solutions are explored graphically and are compared with solutions for previous foraging models. In general, the model predicts that foragers with a goal of maximizing net reproduction should accept greater risks of starvation than foragers with a goal of minimizing the risk of failing to satisfy minimum energy requirements. © 1991.},

This analysis yields many dynamical features that have been attributed to cannibalism in the literature, including density self-regulation, a "life-boat strategy" phenomenon by which a population avoids extinction by practicing cannibalism under circumstances when it would otherwise go extinct, and multiple stable positive equilibrium states and hysteresis. © 1992.},

When selection is operating under more than one constraint, the marginal fitnesses of any two strategy components are equal at the ESS whenever both components are affected by only one, and the same, binding constraint.

The monoecious, diploid population is subdivided into an infinite linear array of equally large, panmictic colonies that exchange gametes symmetrically. Migration is reduced across the geographical barrier, but is otherwise uniform. Generations are discrete and nonoverlapping; the analysis is restricted to a single locus in the absence of selection; every allele mutates to new alleles at the same rate. The two dimensionless parameters in the theory are β = 4ρ0[formula] and κ where ρ0, u, V0, and κ represent the population density, mutation rate, variance of gametic dispersion per generation, and penetrability of the barrier, respectively. The characteristic length is [formula]. Relative to a homogeneous infinite habitat, the barrier raises the probability of identity if the two points of observation are on the same side and lowers it if they are on opposite sides. The former effect is moderate or small, but the latter is large unless transmission is high (κ ≫ 1); genetic differentiation across the barrier is very strong for low transmission (κ ≪ 1). For points of observation on the same side, the influence of the barrier is significant only if the proximal point is within a few characteristic lengths. Upper and lower bounds on the probability of identity are established, and approximations are derived for four cases: (i) low expected homozygosity (β ≫1), (ii) high transmission, (iii) low transmission, and (iv) at least one point distant. © 1993 Academic Press.},

It is shown that under less stringent assumptions, the global attractor of a competition system consists of species assortments that minimize a function of consumers' abundances, called inefficient energy utilization. If the minimum is unique (whether or not lying on the boundary of the state space) the global attractor reduces to a globally stable equilibrium. The inefficient energy utilization is the sum of two terms: one, called unutilized productivity, is the squared difference between maximum resource production and consumers' consumption, while the second, called basal energy consumption, is the caloric income to a community necessary for maintaining it at a steady state. The minimum principle is then used to solve some ecological and evolutionary problems. It is demonstrated that if an inverse correlation is assumed between consumers' efficiency and width of the trophic niche, evolution in undisturbed environments leads to assortments of tightly packed specialists. © 1990.},

	abstract = {Four key variables of migration that can be used to model the abundance of shorebirds at staging areas during an autumn or spring migration are described. They are Overlap, the average time birds stop over at staging areas; Compression, the total length of time that the migration takes; Volume, the total number of birds that pass through on migration; and Residency, the number of birds "resident" during the nonbreeding season. An iterative method is described that uses the four variables to estimate the total number of shorebirds staging during the course of a single migration. While specifically applied to shorebird migrations, the model may also be used to model the dynamics of any animal population stopping over at a staging area on migration. © 1993 Academic Press.

Temporal overlap and difference between consumer efficiencies play roles that are in general qualitatively similar to those of niche overlap and difference between carrying capacities in the classical theory of competition in a constant environment. But the relative time scale of resource dynamics plays a crucial role which does not have an analogue in the classical theory: coexistence at the consumer level is possible only above threshold values of both frequency and speed of dynamics at the resource level. © 1992.},

When predators diffuse and prey are sedentary, heterogeneity in the prey growth rate is amplified in the prey equilibrium distribution. When both species diffuse rapidly, patterns in their distributions are homogenized, but their total abundances are maximized. In contrast to the nonspatial constant Lotka-Volterra model, which features sustained oscillations, perturbations to the heterogeneous environment model decay to equilibrium exponentially fast. When prey are stationary, the rate of decay is proportional to the predator diffusion coefficient. The rate of approach to equilibrium slows as prey mobility increases. These results are interpreted as the creation of a prey refuge by density dependence implicit in the motion of nonuniformly distributed diffusing populations. © 1991.},

Models of evolutionary change in such parameters are studied analytically. Whether the population will evolve towards stability or towards chaos is model-dependent. This is caused by model-dependent differences in the coupling of stability evolution to selection for increased carrying capacity, and differences in whether the parameters act predominantly at high or at low densities. Generally, stability is favored by selection at high densities while unstability is favored at low densities. As the former selection pressure tends to be stronger, it is likely that a deterministically fluctuating population with constant carrying capacity will evolve towards Stability. © 1992.},

We find a strongly enhanced extinction risk if stochasticity in sex ratio and fluctuating population size act simultaneously as compared to the case where each mechanism acts alone. The distribution of extinction times deviates slightly from a geometric one, in particular for short extinction times. We also find that whether maximization of intrinsic growth rate decreases the risk of extinction or not depends strongly on the population regulation mechanism. If the population growth regime reduces populations above the carrying capacity to a size below the carrying capacity for large r (overshooting) then the extinction risk increases if the growth rate deviates from an optimal r-value. © 1992.},

We develop a general accounting framework that addresses this deficiency. In our framework, each connection (both physical and informational) can be unambiguously assigned, quantified, and qualified, and an input-output balance is easily checked and maintained for each product. Costly independent data collections can be integrated into this common framework to amplify their original usefulness and provide the investigator or ecosystem manager with enhanced understanding of the entire ecosystem from which they were taken. The integrated data also allow various ecosystem models to be constructed efficiently, without unnecessary and costly duplication of effort. We present detailed guidelines for construction of such a framework, followed by examples and applications. © 1991.},

The result is that the change in the geometric average and in the arithmetic average of the mean fertilities in male and female offspring is approximately equal to the additive genetic variance in fertility. Then we show that fertility-viability selection models and kin selection models with sex differences are special cases if appropriate fitness parameters are introduced and if genotype frequencies are considered at an appropriate time of the life cycle.

Three mutually complementary approaches have been used: structural-functional, informational-cybernetic, and evolutionary. Detailed features of our unified approach included the following: (1) linking prebiological and biological processes of molecular evolution through molecular systems of self-reproduction; (2) elaboration of a unified theory of micro- and macromolecular evolution; (3) use of data from molecular phytogeny, taxonomy, and paleontology; (4) combining structural-functional, informational-cybernetic, and evolutionary approaches; (5) related analyses of stochastic and deterministic processes and factors; (6) integrated exposition of the MGRS limiting factors and of the associated evolutionary devices which overcome them; (7) related analyses of molecular evolutionary, ecological, and environmental factors; (8) formulation of general principles of TME; (9) proposing a scenario of the major stages of molecular evolution. General processes of TME are (a) emergence of molecular genetic organization; (b) evolution of genes, RNAs, and proteins; (c) evolution of genomes and Subsystems of MGRS. © 1990.},

The system of ordinary differential equations thus obtained are solved, and the dependence on the parameters of horizontal (within generations) transmission and natural selection is examined. The time required is found to be substantially longer when the determination of a phenotypic difference subject to natural selection is partly cultural rather than completely genetic.

The ruggedness of the environment is measured by the extent of random variation in per-capita reproductive success. We show how variable diapause and environmental characteristics affect the population′s stochastic growth rate. In rugged unpredictable environments, phenotypes that show some tendency to diapause are found to have a higher growth rate than nondiapausing phenotypes. In harsh rugged environments, some tendency to diapause may be all that permits population persistence. Positive serial autocorrelation causes the optimal diapause fraction to decrease, while negative autocorrelation causes that fraction to increase. The structured model behaves very differently from a scalar model for large diapause fractions even in uncorrelated environments, and in many cases predicts a broad optimum. The difference between models is due to the extreme variability of stage structure in populations subject to even small variability when diapause tendency is high. © 1993 Academic Press.},

	abstract = {A theoretical study has been made of the contact between two populations (island-continent model) which are partially isolated insofar as they are monomorphic for different alleles at one or more strictly underdominant loci with multiplicative heterozygote fitnesses. This genetic model of an isolating mechanism is the simplest model of zygotic isolation and is also a very good representation of underdominant chromosomal rearrangements. The particular problem tackled is how the threshold value of the migration rate (mc), below which differentiation at the underdominant loci can persist, varies as a function of the number of underdominant loci involved (n), for a given level of selection against hybrids (α). It has been found that the stability of genetic differentiation causing a given level α of reproductive isolation decreases as the number of loci involved increases. This effect is particularly noticeable for low levels of isolation. These results have some relevance with regard to the question of whether the establishment of zygotic reproductive isolation between populations occurs more probably as a result of many mutations with small effects on fitness or of only a few mutations with significant effects. © 1992.},

	abstract = {The value of food sharing among relatives is analyzed for a situation where fitness equals survival. In seasonal environments the minimum food abundance may set a limit to group living. Delayed dispersal is predicted to be linked to relaxed winter competition and high parental survival. Enhanced survival for the offspring when parents share food could be a sufficient reason to delay dispersal, while early dispersal in advance of food shortage periods may be induced by a competitive relationship. At low resource abundance dominant parents do best by being competitive and retaining all resources. For food abundance higher than the expected requirements food sharing with independent offspring is possible, although it has a non-zero cost. Food sharing parents still retain most of resources to themselves, but the resource share given to subordinate offspring gradually gets larger when food abundance increases. Except for at very low food abundance, where subordinates may adopt a "suicidal" behaviour and cede their resources to the dominant, there is a conflict over how to share the resources. © 1992.},

The exact values of the fixation probability are found by iterating transition matrices with genotype specification. Differences in results among models are small. The exact values found in the first model are compared to estimates obtained from approximations. Solutions based on diffusion models give good approximations when selection against the heterozygote is low, especially if the population is very small.

The model predicts that the optimal growth schedule of pathogens strongly depends on the curvature of f(N): If f(N) increases faster than linearly with N, the pathogens should always reproduce at the maximum speed. By contrast, if f(N) saturates with N, the optimal schedule is composed of (1) a brief initial stage of infection, in which the pathogens proliferate at the maximum speed (productive cycle), (2) followed by the long latent period with the "stationary infection level," N* (latent cycle), (3) which may end when the pathogens start rapid proliferation triggered either by the host's senescence ("programmed break") or by the sudden rise in the host's mortality ("incidental break"). The latter may be caused by the double infection of another strain. We also examine the Nash equilibrium schedule of pathogen growth in the presence of multiple infections. © 1991.},

We also show that the RUG (Random Union of Gametes) model is not suitable for a cytonuclear system. The study is also accompanied by a comparison with a two-locus nuclear system. We show that in a finite population of size N without mutation, the rate of decrease of the cytonuclear allelic disequilibrium is the same as that in the corresponding unlinked two-locus nuclear system. The principal rate of decrease of variance in allelic disequilibrium in a cytonuclear system is slightly faster than that in the corresponding nuclear system. However, the expected value of the variance in cytonuclear disequilibria is larger than that in a two-locus nuclear system for at least the first N generations. With mutation, the expected value of steady state variances of both systems are about the same; however, the normalized variance in linkage disequilibrium σd2 of the cytonuclear system is about twice as large as that for the corresponding nuclear system. For the migration process, two sets of steady state solutions are provided, one for the variables before migration and the other for the variables after migration. Diffusion approximations for both the principal rate of decay and steady state solutions in both systems are found to be satisfactory. A more accurate backward diffusion equation for a two-locus nuclear system is provided when the recombination fraction R is large. © 1992.},

The effects of dormancy also are examined. In some cases, evolutionarily stable strategies result, and are estimated through simulations and through analytical approximations. However, in other cases, e.g., in spatially heterogeneous environments, or in the homogeneous case with negative temporal correlation, there is no intermediate evolutionarily stable strategy; rather, in some situations the "best" type, termed an evolutionarily compatible strategy (ECS), is one that can invade any other single type, but also is open to invasion by any type. For these cases, it is conjectured that there is a stable coexisting band of types, not necessarily including the ECS. In general, positive (Markovian) temporal correlations decrease the optimal dispersal fraction by increasing the average yield of non-dispersing seeds; dormancy has a similar effect. Spatial heterogeneity has some features in common with positive temporal correlations, but the structure of the autocorrelation function is more complicated. Optimal dispersal is decreased; but as mentioned above, there is no ESS in general. Diffuse competitive effects may not be understood entirely in terms of pairwise interactions, and a variety of open problems exist in characterizing interactions among multiple types. © 1991.},

	abstract = {In the framework of optimal foraging theory we present an optimization model for herd size selection by ungulates. The model is constructed on the basis of a survey of the pertinent literature concerning the social behavior and ecology of ungulates. The use of the optimization model relies on the idea that natural selection shapes the policy of choice of herd sizes in the sense that the animals tend to maximize their individual "fitness." The model concerns animals that perform a daily selection of herd size during a period of N days, the Nth day corresponding to the beginning of the reproductive season. We assume that the herdmates share the food in the patch and that the per-individual mortality rate (due to predation) is a decreasing function of herd size. Further constraints are introduced for minimal and maximal levels of energy storage. We consider three different optimization strategies based on maximizing (i) the final energy level EN′ (ii) the final survival probability PN′ and (iii) their product ENPN. Strategy (iii) is the most relevant since it corresponds to maximizing the effective expected reproductive fitness (i.e., the expected number of offspring). We present explicit solutions for the three problems of optimization and we examine the optimal policies in relation to predation pressure and to food distribution patterns. Finally we present a comparison of our theoretical predictions with the biological evidence. There appears to be good qualitative agreement. © 1992.},

Simple models of the evolution of breeding systems that represent inbreeding depression as a constant parameter do not admit the possibility of stable mixed mating systems involving both inbreeding and random mating. Contrary to this expectation, we find that coevolution between a modifier of selfing and a single overdominant locus situated anywhere in the genome can generate evolutionarily attracting mixed mating systems. Two forms of association between the modifier locus and the viability locus promote the evolution of outcrossing. The favored heterozygous genotype at the viability locus develops positive associations with modifier alleles that enhance outcrossing and with the heterozygous genotype at the modifier locus. Associations between outcrossing and high viability evolve immediately upon the introduction of a rare modifier allele, even in the absence of linkage. © 1991.},

	abstract = {A parasite's host range essentially defines its niche breadth, which, as foraging theory predicts, is influenced by resource availability. For parasites, the interaction of infection and transmission characteristics with host population dynamics determines host availability. An epidemiological model, involving two host types and describing competition between a "generalist" parasite strain and a related "specialist" strain, is used to examine the interplay among host range, relative host availabilities, and adaptational compromises engendered by increased host range. Results show that the generalist can predominate even when it cannot maintain itself in either host alone, but that the specialist can persist if its reproductive rate attains some threshold relative to either of the generalist's respective rates in its two hosts. The model is in rough, qualitative agreement with observed dynamics of two Leishmania parasite-host systems, and overall results suggest that infection of two species with a common parasite can lead to complex, indirect coevolutionary dynamics. © 1992.},

	abstract = {The timing and relative contributions of mortality agents in plant populations depend on the ways in which density-dependent (DD) mortality compensates for density-independent (DI) mortality rate. This relationship, in turn, determines the degree of canopy closure, or its complement, gap area. A model is presented that integrates the effects of DD and DI mortality agents, and it permits exploration of the "density compensation" (DC) effect, or the degree to which mortality caused by DI factors is alleviated by reductions in DD mortality, and changing gap area through time. DI mortality factors can be additive, and they affect the entire population early and late in life. If DI motality is low, crowding results in a DD mortality rate that is rather constant when plants are growing rapidly, and DD mortality descreases as plants approach maximum size. DD mortality rate compensates for DI mortality rate in populations of plants that are young and at high density: Although increased DI mortality contributes to increasing gap area as plants mature, such an increase is not necessary for gap area to increase. Reduced density compensation with age (declining plant growth rate) results in increased gap area even if per-capita mortality rates descrease. Complete canopy coverage shifts form a stable to a neutrally stable equilibrium with advancing stand age. Net ecosystem production (NEP) is maximized earliest during stand development at somewhat less than complete canopy coverage. This maximum occurs later in stands having lower canopy caverage, because of low DD mortality rate, and in stands having higher canopy coverage, because of high density. Low canopy coverage early in stand development will be associated with delayed maximum NEP if that low canopy coverage is associated with low density and with early maximum NEP if low canopy coverage results instead from high DI mortality rate. The self-thinning rule arises as a special case of a more general relationship that demonstrates the effects of canopy and DI mortality on the percent change in density that attends a percent change in standing crop. Because of high DC early in stand development, the tendency of this slope coefficient to become more negative with declining canopy coverage prevails over the tendency of DI mortality to make this coefficient less negative. With declining DC late in stand development the situation is reserved. © 1992.},

	abstract = {Simple theories for the evolution of breeding systems suggest that the fate of an allele that modifies the rate of self-fertilization hinges only on the degree to which selfing reduces opportunities for outcrossing ("pollen discounting") and the extent of inbreeding depression. These theories predict that outcrossing evolves whenever deleterious mutations have a more severe effect in combination than expected from their individual effects. We study the evolutionary dynamics of a modifier of the rate of self-fertilization in populations subject to complete pollen discounting and recurrent mutations which impair viability at a single locus in diploids and at two loci in haploids. Our analysis indicates that genetic associations arising immediately upon the introduction of a rare modifier allele generate substantial quantitative and qualitative departures from expectation. Higher rates of segregation under selfing in our one-locus diploid model generate positive associations between enhancers of selfing and wild-type viability alleles, which in turn favor the evolution of selfing under a wider range of conditions than expected. Greater opportunities for recombination under outcrossing in our two-locus haploid model generate positive associations between enhancers of outcrossing and wild-type viability alleles. These associations favor the evolution of outcrossing under a wider range of conditions, and introduce the possibility of stable mixed mating systems involving both selfing and outcrossing. Our explicit analysis of genetic associations between loci affecting viability and the rate of self-fertilization indicates that modifiers that enhance the production of offspring with very high (and very low) viability by promoting segregation or recombination develop positive associations with high viability. This advantage of producing extremes can compensate for an initial disadvantage in offspring number. © 1991.},

Biol. 39, 63-99) by analytic solution of the problem of invasion of a single dispersal type by any other, have provided a theory for evolutionarily stable strategies for seed dispersal in a random environment. Here the results of Cohen and Levin are extended to describe evolutionarily stable combinations of dispersal types. Such combinations of two types are coalitions that cannot be invaded by any other, although in isolation either of the types in the combination is invasible by others. These combinations appear when there is a negative correlation between the seed production of sites in successive years, or when environments are spatially heterogeneous, or presumably under other circumstances. In this work, we examine only the case of negative correlations. For this situation the configuration of evolutionarily stable strategies (ESS) and evolutionarily stable combinations (ESC) depends upon the ratio of (precompetitive) survival rates of dispersersing and nondispersing seeds, which is denoted by α. For low values of α, the purely nondispersing type is an ESS. At a somewhat higher value of α, the purely dispersing type can invade the nondispersing type, and the two types form an ESC, i.e., a combination that cannot be invaded by any other type. For still larger values of α, the purely nondispersing type is excluded by the ESC. Finally, for the largest values of α, pure dispersal is the ESS. In cases where a single dispersal type cannot exclude all others, the stationary distribution of types has a large spread. It can be adequately approximated by equations for conditional means of the proportions of various types at a site of a given quality, but these means must be conditioned upon the prior history at each site. For some purposes we have found that the history of as many as 8-10 generations is required for a good approximation. This phenomenon appears to preclude simple analytic approximations for the ESC. © 1991.},

	abstract = {We explore the effects of interactive variation in predation, interspecific competition, and the availability of absolute, spatial prey refuges on the local diversity of a sessile prey assemblage potentially competing for space. Prey diversity responds to increasing predation intensity in a characteristic pattern, called a "prey-diversity response." Previous theoretical and empirical studies have demonstrated three prey-diversity responses: negative, unimodal, and bimodal. Using simple simulations involving two to five prey species, we examine four scenarios: (1) Given a negative response in a simple habitat, such that diversity only decreases as predation intensity increases, increasing the proportion of the habitat that is safe from prédation should result in a gradual flattening of the negatively sloped diversity-response curve. (2) Given a unimodal prey-diversity response where the dominant competitor persists over most predation intensities, such that diversity initially increases and subsequently decreases as predation increases from zero, the effects of refuges are more complex. As the proportion of prey-refuge space increases at low prédation intensities, prey diversity should decrease monotonically. However, at high predation intensities, prey diversity should initially increase and subsequently decrease as refuge space increases. Consequently, the shape of the prey diversity-response curve should change progressively from a unimodal function, with the peak shifting to the right, to a monotonically increasing function which gradually flattens. (3) Given a system where the dominant is extirpated at low prédation intensity, but a unimodal prey-diversity response occurs nonetheless, increasing refuge space should result in diversity initially increasing and subsequently decreasing at most predation intensities. In this case, the position of the peak of the unimodal curve should not shift along the abscissa. (4) Combining the previous two patterns, prey refuges can transform a bimodal response into a unimodal response. Although no explicit tests if these models are currently available, data from three published experimental studies of sessile marine benthos are consistent with some of these predictions. © 1991.},

We show how some dispersal may be advantageous, even when the survivorship of dispersed offspring is substantially less than that of nondispersed offspring. Using a procedure which minimizes the extinction probability for the lineage (hence maximizing survivorship of the genetic individual), we predict that a high proportion of dispersed offspring should be associated with high numbers of asexual offspring, a low risk of mortality to offspring during dispersal, and high local survivorship of offspring. We give supportive evidence for the first prediction using data from the freshwater bryozoan Plumatella repens and suggest that future theoretical work on dispersal dimorphisms might profitably use a probabilistic approach such as the one presented here. © 1992.},

	abstract = {We derived analytical results for the reduction of the level of neutral polymorphism due to genetic hitchhiking using diffusion theory. In the case of a single strongly selected substitution, expected heterozygosity at a linked neutral locus is reduced by a factor ( 2c s)α -2c sΓ( -2c s), 1 α), where s is the selective advantage of the favored allele, c is the recombination fraction between the neutral and selected locus, and α = 2Ns, with N as the diploid population size. Γ denotes the incomplete gamma function. Using this result and assuming that at any one time at most one substitution is on its way to fixation, the effect of recurrent selected substitutions on expected heterozygosity can be approximated by 1 [1-α( v ρ{variant})λ( 1 α, - 2M s)], where ν and ρ{variant} are the expected numbers of selected substitutions and crossovers, respectively, per chromosome, per nucleotide, per generation, and M is the maximal recombination distance from the neutral locus that a selected mutation can be and still have a hitchhiking effect on the neutral locus.

The model can also be interpreted as describing a herbivore population distributed on discrete patches of vegetation. We derive differential equations for the total number of hosts/patches and the mean number of parasites/herbivores per host/patch. The equations explicitly involve the variance-to-mean ratio of the distribution. It is shown that the positive equilibrium is stable if and only if the variance-to-mean ratio as a function of the mean increases with increasing mean. Thus aggregation of the parasites alone is not sufficient to stabilize the system; it is rather the density-dependent increase in parasite mortality due to a higher aggregation at higher mean parasite loads that causes stability. From this it follows that introducing a distribution with a constant clumping parameter into the model artificially stabilizes the steady state. We derive a three-dimensional model based on an assumption about the form of the distribution of the parasites on the hosts, but without introducing additional parameters into the model. We compare stability results for this model for different types of aggregated distributions and show that the underlying distribution determines the qualitative results about the stability of the equilibrium. © 1993 Academic Press.},

The additional species is either an alternative prey or a higher-level predator that consumes the first predator species. Results indicate that a variety of effects on predator-prey coevolution are possible. In general, the additional species does not decouple evolutionary changes in the predator and the prey, and often leads to stronger coupling. The manner in which predator and prey adaptations combine to determine the predator's capture rate has a major effect on how an additional species influences the coevolutionary responses of the original pair of species. © 1991.},

Thus the observed fluctuations in population density likely reflect random perturbations. It is shown that populations governed by hump-with-tail maps are less prone to extinction in randomly fluctuating environments than hypothetical populations whose growth is governed by "one hump" maps, i.e., maps with a maximum as their only extremal value.

	abstract = {We examine the generation of cytonuclear disequilibria by admixture and continued gene flow. General formulas analogous to the nuclear case are first derived showing that the allelic and genotypic disequilibria from admixture or population subdivision equal their expected value across the contributing (sub) populations plus the covariance across these sources between the cytoplasmic gene frequency and the relevant nuclear frequency. A detailed study is then presented of the cytonuclear dynamics, in a random-mating population under two different migration scenarios. In both cases closed-form solutions are given for all variables as a function of the initial conditions and relevant migration parameters. The dynamics of the gene frequencies and allelic disequilibria, which dominate each system, are the same as those involving two unlinked nuclear loci, while the dynamics of the genotypic disequilibria and cytonuclear frequencies have no nuclear counterpart. The continent-island formulation focuses on a population receiving continued immigration from a large source of constant composition. A major discovery is that cytonuclear disequilibria can transiently build up on the "island" to levels far exceeding those found at equilibrium. In contrast, the admixture formulation focuses on the dynamics within two populations undergoing continued intermigration. Although in this case all cytonuclear associations must ultimately decay to zero, long-term transient disequilibria can develop which are many times their initial admixture values. For both migration scenarios it is shown that the time of population censusing relative to migration and reproduction dramatically affects both the amount and pattern of the nonrandom associations produced. The empirical relevance of these models is discussed in light of nuclear-mitochondrial data from a hybrid zone between European and North American eels and from a zone of racial admixture in humans. © 1991.},

The inclusion of different mathematical forms of a maturation weighting function allows us to investigate the effect of several aspects of variation in immature stage durations on the outcome of competilition between the parasitoids. The two parasitoid species cannot coexist if the host developmental stages are fixed in duration. The outcome of competition depends in part on the relative duration of the two stages attacked by the parasitoid species. However, coexistence is possible if there is sufficient variation in the time that different host individuals remain in each stage Distributed host developmental delays promote coexistence because they cause the host population to be composed of a mixture of host types with different relative egg versus larval stage durations. Each host type is thus largely available to only one of the parasitoid species. © Academic Press inc.},

	abstract = {An altruistic act is a process of transmission of fitness units (not necessarily one to one) from a donor to a recipient or recipients. Hamilton's rule gives the conditions under which an altruistic act should be directed toward relatives. Giving warning signals is different from most altruistic behaviors in that there is usually no physical proximity between the donor and the recipient. As a result, the information to the donor about the presence of potential recipients and the perception of warning signals by recipients may not be perfect. I show that under such conditions, an altruistic act (warning signal) may be given even when recipients are not present. Furthermore, it appears that the expected proportion of predator-prey encounters in which warning signals are given is not a monotonic, simple, positive function of the potential recipient density. Rather, under certain conditions and within a limited range of increment in prey density, the frequency of warning signals may even decrease. This is because the expected proportion of warning signals depends also on the prey's ability to perceive the presence and warning signals of other prey, and on the frequency distribution of costs of warning signals. These factors, in turn, are functions of the habitat type, the nature of prey distribution (clumped or uniform), the hunting strategy of the predator, and the escaping strategy of prey. Therefore, one should consider all these factors when evaluating the effect of one of them on the expected proportion of warning signals. © 1989.},

Two causes of inbreeding depression are investigated. First, offspring viability depends solely on the source (self or non-self) of the fertilizing pollen. Second, offspring viability declines with the expression of recessive deleterious alleles, segregating at a third (disease) locus, which exhibit an imperfect association with antigen alleles. Evolutionary changes occurring at the disease locus are not considered in this study. The condition under which a modifier allele that intensifies the incompatibility reaction increases when rare depends upon the number of antigens, the frequency of recessive deleterious alleles at the disease locus, and the level of association between the antigen locus and the disease locus. It is the improvement of viability among offspring derived by outcrossing, rather than the prevention of self-fertilization, that may represent the primary evolutionary function of genetic incompatibility systems. © 1988.},

Stable limit cycles occurred when the normalized slope of the egg survival function was sufficiently negative. The frequency of these cycles depended on equilibrium level. From comparisons of (1) egg survival data to the derived stability condition and (2) the frequency of observed cycles to those of the model, we concluded that the worm is not the sole cause of the cycles in the northern California crab catch. Changes in the model, survival of the worm past one year, and density-dependent efficiency of prey conversion were shown to be destabilizing, but they did not change the conclusion that the worm was not the sole cause. A model with both the egg predator and density-dependent recruitment in the prey indicated that these mechanisms in combination could produce the observed cycles, even when each by itself could not. © 1989.},

Suppression of gene conversion evolves if the driven allele is marginally disadvantageous (overdominant viability selection), and higher rates evolve if the driven alleles are relatively advantageous (purifying viability selection). Gametic disequilibria permit enhancers of meiotic drive that are linked to the driven locus to promote their own segregation. We attribute the failure of genetic modifiers of gene conversion and meiotic drive to maximize mean fitness to the generation of such associations. © 1990.},

Certain simple cooperative strategies, notably TIT-FOR-TAT, have been successful in computer simulations of the evolution of populations of individuals who interact according to the Prisoner's Dilemma. Some attempts to formalize this have used the concept of "evolutionary stability." But Boyd and Lorberbaum (1987, Nature (London) 327, 58-59) recently showed that no single pure strategy (such as TIT-FOR-TAT) can be evolutionarily stable. We extend their argument to derive a more powerful result, which implies, first, that no finite mixture of pure strategies can be evolutionarily stable, and, second, that no mixture of TIT-FOR-n-TATS can be evolutionarily stable. We interpret our negative results to suggest that evolutionary stability is too demanding a criterion. © 1989.},

	abstract = {A continuous-time model, similar to W. M. Schaffer's (1983, Amer. Nat. 121, 418-431), of growth and reproduction for a perennial herb with discrete growing seasons is considered. Assuming that metabolic rates of reproductive and storage structures are equal, it was possible, through the reduction of the continuous model to a discrete one, to find the optimal allocations to the vegetative, reproductive, and reserve structures. The main feature of the optimal strategy is the existence of an optimal reserve size. The allocation to vegetative structures is, every growing season, the allocation which maximizes the total of reproductive and reserve structures at the end of the season. The relative allocation between reserve and reproductive structures is given, when reproductive success is a linear function of investment, by the fastest growth to the optimal size: no reproduction until the optimal size is reached, and, afterwards, allocation to reproduction of everything beyond what is needed to maintain size R*. Asymptotic growth to the equilibrium and cycles are possible, when reproductive success is a nonlinear function of investment (A. Pugliese, 1988, in "Biomathematics and Related Computational Problems" (L. M. Ricciardi, Ed.), Reidel, Dordrecht, to appear). It has therefore been possible to solve the "general life history problem" (Schaffer, 1983) when growth is in general a concave function of body size. In the Discussion discrete and continuous-time models are compared; if the real dynamics is described by a continuous model of the type analyzed here, life history predictions made by analyzing the system with a discrete model are upheld. © 1988.},

When temporary storage of energy is impossible or too costly, a gradual switch from vegetative to reproductive growth will be optimal.

	abstract = {A simple model is presented for finding which male strategy is advantageous for fertilization of eggs, guarding a specific female, or searching for many females. The model assumes that there is a finite mating period in which the number of virgin females decreases temporally. When more than one male copulates with the same female, the last copulating male can displace a constant proportion of the sperm injected the other males. Two oviposition patterns of females (single lump oviposition after the mating period and continuous ovipositions through the period) are analyzed. The model predicts (i) that when the sperm displacement rate is 1, the guarding strategy (GS) is more advantageous than the searching strategy (SS) if and only if the sex ratio (males/females) is larger than 1, independent of the searching efficiency and the oviposition pattern, and (ii) that when the sperm displacement rate is smaller than 1, GS is more advantageous than SS for higher values of sex ratio, sperm displacement, and searching efficiency. The results of the current non-stationary model are compared with those of our previous stationary model of postcopulatory guarding (Yamamura, 1986, Theor. Pop. Biol., 29, 438-455). Both models suggest that there is a common tendency toward coexistence of guarding and searching strategies in the same population, and that the product of the sex ratio and the sperm displacement rate represents a rough criterion for an optimal strategy in more general cases. © 1989.},

In an example for continuous sibship data, these formulas show that estimates derived from conditioning on proband value have greater asymptotic bias than two other estimators. Similarly, either conditioning on proband value or conditioning on the number of affected family members resulted in biases of up to 30% when ascertainment depended on the values of more than one affected family member. © 1990.},

Conditions for the initial increase of gametophytic self-incompatibility in a self-compatible population undergoing selfing, sibmating, and random outcrossing are reported. The adaptive value of reducing the concordance between offspring and maternal genotypes depends upon the relative changes in the numbers of offspring derived by the three modes, parent-offspring relatedness, and the magnitude of distortion of transmission ratios through pollen. Recessivity of stylar expression and low rates of receipt of pollen from related individuals facilitate the evolution of self-incompatibility. Viewed as a means of preferential maternal investment in offspring of high quality, self-incompatibility may be regarded as serving a function in common with diverse phenomena, including sexual selection, brood reduction, and other forms of prezygotic and postzygotic incompatibility. Associations between incompatibility loci and loci expressing inbreeding depression are expected to improve the reliability of the level of concordance at incompatibility loci as a measure of genomic homozygosity and offspring quality. © 1988.},

Simulations are also used to investigate the bias and mean square error of four estimators of 4Nu, where N is the population size and u is the neutral mutation rate per nucleotide site. Two of the estimators are biased by approximately 20 percent when levels of variation are similar to those which have been observed in natural populations of Drosophila. © 1989.},

One possibility is to interpret Fisher's postulated "initial advantage not due to female preference" as a shift in viability selection where runaway evolution occurs if the mean preferred trait evolves beyond its new viability optimum (due to sexual selection). This definition is contrasted with situations in which the new viability optimum is undershot.

	abstract = {This paper considers 14 models as possible explanations of three major structural trends observed in 113 community food webs: (1) The average proportion of species that are top species is roughly constant in webs with different total numbers of species. The same holds for the average proportions of intermediate and basal species. (2)The average proportion of links that are intermediate-top links is roughly constant in webs with different total numbers of species. The same constancy of proportions in webs with different numbers of species holds for the three other kinds of links. (3) The frequency distributions of chain lengths are unimodal with modes usually between two and five links. One model, the cascade model, explains these trends and other structural trends. The other 13 models relax in various ways the cascade model's assumption that the probability of predation is the same between every pair of potential predator and potential prey and its assumption that the average probability of predation is inversely proportional to the total number of species in the web. Numerical comparisons of the observed structural trends with the model predictions show that the only viable alternative to the cascade model is the predator-dominant, constant-column-sum, linear-link-scaling model. This model differs from the cascade model in assuming that the expected number of prey species of any potential predator is the same as that for any other potential predator. The biological lesson suggested by these findings is that potential predators appear to have a mean number of prey species that is closer to constant than to linearly increasing with rank in the cascade model. Models that assume that predation probabilities are determined primarily by the prey species or by the distance between species in a cascade make predictions that are inferior descriptions of the major structural trends. Models that assume the mean number of trophic links increases as the 1.35 power of the total number of species make predictions that are inferior to those of models that assume the mean number of trophic links increases linearly with the total number of species. © 1990.},

	abstract = {G. Maffi and S. D. Jayakar suggested a model for the two-locus control of sex determination in the mosquito Aedes aegypti (1981, Theor. Pop. Biol.19, 19-36). This model was extended to multiple alleles and analyzed in mathematical detail by S. Lessard (1987, Theor. Pop. Biol.31, 339-358). The model supposes that males are "Mm" and females "mm" but the transmission from males is controlled by a second gene with alleles Ai. We show that in addition to the equilibrium in which mAi in females, MAi from males and mAi from males all have the same frequencies, a second class of polymorphic equilibria exists and can be stable. The former class was shown by Lessard to be stable for intermediate and/or loose linkage. The new class of equilibria may be stable for tight linkage under the conditions that preclude stability of the former. We also develop the theory of linkage modification from the neighborhood of the new equilibrium. Successful modifiers of recombination may either reduce or increase the recombination fraction with the outcome depending on the linkage of the modifier to the major genes. © 1989.},

Variance expressions are derived for (a) the future values of the physiological variables under the assumption that external factors evolve under a linear stochastic diffusion process, and (b) the cohort survival functions and cohort life expectancies which reflect the uncertainty in the future values of the physiological variables. The model implies that a major component of uncertainty in forecasts of the physiological characteristics of a closed cohort is due to differential rates of survival associated with different realizations of the external process. This suggests that the limits to forecasting may be different in physiological systems subject to systematic mortality than in physical systems such as weather where the concepts of closed cohorts and of mortality selection have no simple analog. © 1989.},

The resource abundance of a patch is assumed to be dependent on two processes: renewal, a property of the environment and resource concerned, and depletion by a forager to a fixed minimum density. The modelling procedure is specifically applied to animals exploiting nectar in flowers although it may be more generally applicable. Each flower is considered to be a separate patch. The model enables us to predict the way in which the mean and standard deviation of nectar content varies with foraging intensity, and time (diurnal patterns). Factors affecting the relationship between the mean and standard deviation of flower nectar content are discussed. Diurnal variations in the mean and standard deviation of flower nectar content are emphasized. Data on sunbirds Nectarina spp. foraging on nectar in L. nepetifolia flowers (Gill and Wolf, 1977, Ecology 58, 1284-1296) is used to test aspects of the model. © 1988.},

	abstract = {Orians and Pearson (1979) and Schoener (1979) presented theoretical models concerning the economics of load-size choice by "central place" foragers. Their models predict that, when load mass has no effect on travel time, "optimal" load mass (the mass that maximizes resource delivery rate to the central place) increases with increasing distance to the foraging site. Some central place foragers, however, often carry loads so large relative to their body masses that increasing load size can significantly increase travel time. To analyze the foraging of such animals, I develop an extension to Orians and Pearson's model that incorporates an effect of load size on travel time, and I explore how including this effect alters the model's predictions. This analysis indicates that, if increasing load size results in increased travel time, then at great distances from the central place optimal load mass should approach MT, the mass that maximizes return per unit travel time, whereas at very short distances the optimal load mass should approach MC, the mass that maximizes return per unit collecting time. Whether optimal load mass increases or decreases with increasing distance therefore depends on which value is larger, MT or MC. © 1989.},

The effects of alleles are independently drawn from a normal distribution and the initial frequencies of alleles are assumed either to be equal or to be drawn from a neutral equilibrium population. With these two initial gene frequency distributions we examined various properties of the selection response process for the effects of number of alleles and selection intensity. For neutral initial frequencies the effects of multiple alleles compared with two alleles are minor on the ratio of final to initial response (E(R∞)E(R1)) and the half life of response (t0.5), but are significant on the variance of response. Under certain conditions the variance of the selection limit can even increase as selection gets stronger. For equal initial frequencies the effects of multiple alleles are, however, minor on the ratio of the variance of the selection limit to the initial genetic variance, but (E(R∞)E(R1)) and t0.5 increase as the number of alleles increases. The results show that for certain statistics the effects of multiple alleles can be minimized by an appropriate transformation of parameters for given initial gene frequencies, but the effects cannot, in general, be removed by any single transformation or reparameterization of parameters. © 1990.},

I argue that distinct resources may be recognized by two properties: (a) the population level of one is not a function solely of the population level of the other, and (b) there exist consumers and environments such that either consumer fitness or total amount of resource consumed depends on the relative amounts of the two resource types. Three simple models are used to explore the implications of these properties. It is impossible to count resources without making assumptions about the discriminations (between different resource items and the places they become available) that can be made by resource consumers. It nevertheless seems very likely that the number of distinct resources is much greater than the number of consumer species in most biological communities. The idea that plants utilize a much smaller number of resources than animals is questioned, and alternative definitions of "distinct resource" applied in several recent theoretical works are criticized. © 1988.},

Gene conversion can occur between allelic pairs of genes or between non-allelic pairs on the same or different gametes within individuals. Most interest therefore centers on pairs of genes, and five digenic identity measures are required. The behavior over time of these measures is studied, with an emphasis on the effects of gene conversion. Because of the stochastic nature of the forces of drift, recombination, mutation, and conversion, the actual identity status of gene pairs can vary from expectation among replicate populations. To study this variation we compute the expected variances and covariances of the measures, and show that this requires the introduction of trigenic and quadrigenic measures. Allowing for conversion between genes on different gametes requires a large number of these higher-order measures. © 1990.},

Usually the variance of gene frequencies is standardized by dividing it by the mean gene frequency times one minus the mean (FST). Under the model of isolation by distance (usually called the "stepping stone" model), at the stationary state the correlation between the gene frequencies of two populations falls exponentially with the geographic distance between them. Using this model, we derive formulas for variances of blocks of populations of different sizes in one- and two-dimensional space and suggest that the theoretical results may be useful for understanding real observations, some examples of which are presented. We demonstrate how FST increases with the degree of subdivision among populations. We also show the effect of gaps between the sampled populations. Our results are valid, however, for traits other than gene frequencies, as long as their correlation with geographic distance falls exponentially. In the extension to 2-dimensional spaces, we present in closed form the distributions of distances between nodes of a lattice or of two lattices. These distributions might have applications in ecology. © 1990.},

This process is investigated in detail under a simple but general population genetic model. It is concluded that the level of female preference is determined by mutation, selection, and genetic drift acting directly on it, and drags the male trait along with it along the line of equilibria. More attention should be paid to selective forces acting directly on female preference. © 1989.},

	abstract = {We develop a system of equations to analyse the existence of genetic polymorphisms under disruptive selection in heterogeneous environments. These equations have both a genetic and a population density regulation component. In the absence of the genetic component, the equations reduce to a discrete time description of competition between interacting clonal lines or species. We use these equations to demonstrate that different populations, competing along a resource spectrum, are able to dynamically coexist, as asymptotically periodic or chaotic solutions to our system of equations, despite the fact that a coexistence equilibrium-stable or unstable-does not exist. We then extend these results to environments in which several niches are explicitly defined. Our analysis of the ecological component of our model establishes that the answer to questions of coexistence among groups of individuals cannot rely on analyses of the existence of equilibria and their stability properties. In the most general model presented here, we allow for an assortative mating structure that is induced by the spatial heterogeneity of the environment. The level of assortative mating is controlled by a parameter so that at one extreme mating is panmictic, while at the other extreme individuals mate within their natal niches before dispersing to oviposit in other niches. We refer to this spatial mating structure as heteropatry. We investigate, through numerical studies, the properties of a heteropatric model containing both ecological and genetic components. First we address the question of the existence of protected genetic polymorphisms (i.e., the different allelles at a particular locus all increase in frequency when rare) under a wide range of model parameter values in a diallelic one-locus version of our model, assuming panmixis and partial dominance selection of varying direction. We make the point that establishing the instability of monomorphic population equilibria is insufficient to guarantee the existence of a protected polymorphism, since the instability may be in the population size component rather than the genetic frequency component of the monomorphic equilibrium solution. The results indicate that density dependence serves to decrease the likelihood that a protected polymorphism exists, while the degree of selection of natal habitat for oviposition purposes serves to increase this likelihood. The situation is complicated, though, since conditions which promote the existence of protected polymorphisms may actually reduce the possibility that a stable polymorphism exists. Further, the way we introduce density dependence (either by scaling the population interaction coefficients or by altering the shape of the response function) differentially affects the results. Finally, our results suggest that if individuals prefer to oviposit in their best niche (where they are most fit), rather than their natal niche (where they mature), then allele fixation very probably occurs. © 1989.},

Responses to the program may include more than one attractor. The exact timing of the introduction of the program relative to the original epidemic cycle is critical in determining which attractor appears in the response.

The model assumes an arbitrary number of autosomal loci and considers genetic variation (two alleles at each locus) that is not subject to natural selection. The deviation from linkage equilibrium is given in terms of Bennett disequilibria that measure the deviation from Robbins proportions in the gametes, and these are generalized to disequilibrium measures that describe the deviation of genotypic frequencies from Hardy-Weinberg proportions. Alternatively, the derivation from linkage equilibrium is given in terms of linear measures of gametic and of genotypic disequilibrium. The convergence to linkage equilibrium is dominated by the convergence of the gametic frequencies to Robbins proportions, in that the convergence to the genotypic frequencies characteristic of partial selfing is comparatively rapid. At linkage equilibrium the genotypic frequencies deviate from the Hardy-Weinberg proportions, and the generalized disequilibrium measures describing the derviation from Hardy-Weinberg proportions are closely related to joint inbreeding coefficients for the loci. © 1989.},

	abstract = {Conditions for the origin of partial sporophytic self-incompatibility (SSI) are obtained from two quantitative models, which differ with respect to the determination of offspring viability. Offspring viability depends solely on the source (self or nonself) of the fertilizing pollen in the first model, which describes changes only at a primitive S-locus itself. Two loci evolve in the second model: overdominant viability selection maintains an arbitrary number of alleles at one locus, with SSI under the control of a separate locus. In both cases, the origin of SSI requires that the relative change in the numbers of offspring derived by the two reproductive modes compensate for the twofold cost of outcrossing. In the first model studied, the viability of inbred offspring fully determines the relative change in the numbers of inbred and outbred offspring produced. In the second model, the relative change in offspring numbers depends in addition on associations between the S-locus and the viability locus. Because these two-locus associations are comparable in magnitude to the differences between the viabilities of inbred and outbred offspring, SSI can arise under less restrictive conditions than expected from the one-locus model. Greater allelic multiplicity at the viability locus facilitates the origin of SSI by reducing the relative viability of inbred offspring. Tight linkage between the S-locus and the viability locus and high rates of receipt of self-pollen promote the generation and maintenance of associations between the S-locus and the viability locus. In populations in which more than two viability alleles are maintained, the active S-allele can invade even in the absence of linkage with the viability locus. The present study establishes that incompatibility systems can arise in response to identity disequilibrium between a modifier of incompatibility and a locus subject to overdominant viability selection; in particular, compensation for the twofold cost of outcrossing does not require preexisting gametic level disequilibria. © 1989.},

The equation is fm ̄ dt = 2 Cov(m, m′), where dm ̄ dt is the instantaneous rate of change in the mean biological fitness of the population and Cov(m, m′) is the covariance between offspring and parental fitnesses. This formulation differs from Fisher's fundamental theorem in at least two important respects. First, because covariances can be either positive or negative, mean fitness can decline over evolutionary time, in contrast to Fisher's result that fitness always increases. Second, since Cov(m, m′) is a phenotypic rather than a genotypic covariance, natural selection can bring about changes in mean fitness even in the absence of additive genetic variance for fitness. Comparison of simple models of vertical (from parents to offspring) and oblique (from members of the parental generation to offspring) cultural transmission indicates that in the former case, mean fitness can evolve in the absence of genotypic variation for both fitness and the effects of cultural transmission, while in the latter case, both are required for evolution to occur. © 1990.},

Second, models that incorporate a trade-off between clutch size and lifetime fitness are examined when the parameters of this trade-off are stochastic variables. General results are given using unspecified fitness functions, and then specific results using fitness functions in the literature are examined. These analyses demonstrate that incorporating stochasticity into clutch-size models can substantially change the optimal clutch size. It is thus necessary to consider both environmental stochasticity and variability in individual behavior when trying to understand clutch sizes in natural systems. © 1988.},

The monoecious, diploid population is subdivided into a semi-infinite linear array of equally large, panmictic colonies that exchange gametes uniformly and symmetrically. Generations are discrete and nonoverlapping; the analysis is restricted to a single locus in the absence of selection; every allele mutates to new alleles at the same rate. Boundaries corresponding to an impenetrable geographical barrier and to contact with a region of extremely high population density or dispersal rate (a "density-mobility boundary") are both treated. Relative to a homogeneous infinite habitat, a geographical barrier raises, and a density-mobility boundary lowers, the probability of identity. For fixed average position of the two points of observation, the probability of identity decreases with increasing separation. For fixed separation, the probability of identity decreases (increases) as the average position recedes from the barrier (density-mobility boundary). The sole dimensionless parameter in the theory is β = 4ρo √2uVo, where ρo, u, and Vo represent the population density, mutation rate, and variance of gametic dispersion per generation, respectively. The characteristic length is √ Vo (2u). Lower and upper bounds on the probability of identity are established; these yield a simple approximation for β ≫ 1. The probability of identity is obtained as an integral; from this solution, approximations close to and far from the boundary are derived and the exact mean homozygosity at a geographical barrier is evaluated. © 1988.},

If the M m locus is initially monomorphic, and the A a locus has reached equilibrium, the fate of a new modifier allele is found to depend not just on its relative effect on mutation but also upon the linkage, R. Each initial equilibrium may be characterized by a critical value of the recombination rate, R*. If 0 < R* < 0.5, a sufficiently small "down" modifier of the mutation rate will invade the population when R < R* whereas a sufficiently small "up" modifier will succeed when R > R*.

The phenomena seen in the two-locus symmetric fertility model generalize-e.g., the possibility of joint stability of equilibria with linkage equilibrium and with linkage disequilibrium, and the existence of different types of totally polymorphic equilibria with the gametic proportions in linkage equilibrium. The central equilibrium with genotypic frequencies in Hardy-Weinberg proportions and gametic frequencies in Robbins proportions exists for all symmetric fertility models. For some symmetric fertility regimes additional equilibria exist with gametic frequencies in linkage equilibrium and with genotypic frequencies in Hardy-Weinberg proportions at all except one locus. These equilibria may exist in the dioecious symmetric viability model, and then they will be locally stable. For free recombination the stable equilibria show linkage equilibrium, but several of these with different numbers of polymorphic loci may be stable simultaneously. © 1989.},

	abstract = {The mean homozygosity is a useful measure of genetic variation in a natural population and it is of interest to determine the effects of migration and selection on this quantity. It has been shown that some features of the mean homozygosity are independent of migration patterns when alleles are selectively neutral. Here, we examine the mean homozygosity in a structured population to determine if these features are still independent in the presence of selection. We consider the equilibrium mean homozygosity within a single finite subpopulation for a gene with K different allelic types. Each possible genotype is assigned a distinct selection coefficient. Usually the mean homozygosity cannot be explicitly determined in a structured population when selection is operating, even for fairly simple migration patterns, but an approximation can be made. We have found four properties of the mean homozygosity that are independent of migration patterns even when selection is acting. These are the values of the mean homozygosity and of its derivative with respect to the total migration rate into the subpopulation, when migration rates are either very small or very large. These four properties can be combined into a single continuous approximation that is applicable to any migration scheme. The approximation is found to be very accurate when compared to the exact solutions for several population structures and selection schemes. © 1989.},

	abstract = {The lottery model is a stochastic population model in which juveniles compete for space. Examples include sedentary organisms such as trees in a forest and members of marine benthic communities. The behavior of this model appears to be characteristic of that found in other sorts of stochastic competition models. In a community with two species, it was previously demonstrated that coexistence of the species is possible if adult death rates are small and environmental variation is large. Environmental variation is incorporated by assuming that the birth rates and death rates are random variables. Complicated conditions for coexistence and competitive exclusion have been derived elsewhere. In this paper, simple and easily interpreted conditions are found by using the technique of diffusion approximation. Formulae are given for the stationary distribution and means and variances of population fluctuations. The shape of the stationary distribution allows the stability of the coexistence to be evaluated. © 1989.},

	abstract = {This article explores the population dynamics that result when either one- or two-consumer populations optimally exploit two nutritionally complementary or nonsubstitutable resources. It is assumed that the capture rates of the two resources are negatively related, the resources are self-reproducing, and the consumers adjust their capture rates to maximize individual fitness. The result is that consumers maintain a constant ratio of intake rates of the two resources. A model with a single-consumer and two logistically growing resources is analyzed. It is shown that different parameter values can result in a single stable equilibrium, a single unstable equilibrium, or three equilibria. When there are three equilibria, the one with intermediate resource densities is always an unstable node. At least one of the other two equilibria is locally stable. The third equilibrium may be locally stable, locally unstable, and surrounded by a limit cycle or more complex attractor, or may be globally unstable. Increasing consumer death rates in these systems may result in counterintuitive behavior that includes increasing equilibrium or average consumer population size. Modifications of the single-consumer models to include time lags in consumer response or different resource growth functions extends the possible behavior to include 2 alternative limit cycles. Two-consumer models have a single equilibrium point, which is unstable when the resource density at the equilibrium point is sufficiently low. The cycles that occur in such systems may be complex in form, and often involve highly correlated changes in the populations of the two competing consumers. Two competitively equal consumers with very different resource utilization may be unable to coexist in such models, and invasion analysis is inadequate to determine whether consumers will coexist. Several other unusual features of these consumer-resource models are discussed. © 1989.},

	abstract = {The influence of spatial variation in the carrying capacity and migration rate of a geographical barrier on the one-dimensional stepping-stone model is studied. The monoecious, diploid population is subdivided into an infinite linear array of panmictic colonies that exchange gametes. In each deme, the rate of self-fertilization is equal to the reciprocal of the number of individuals in that deme. Generations are discrete and nonoverlapping; the analysis is restricted to a single locus in the absence of selection; every allele mutates to new alleles at the same rate. In the diffusion approximation, a partial differential equation that incorporates spatial (and temporal) variation in the carrying capacity and migration rate is derived for the probability of identity. Transition conditions that simultaneously take into account discontinuities in the carrying capacity and migration rate are established: the probability of identity is continuous, but its partial derivatives are not, their ratio being a simple function of the carrying capacities and migrational variance on the two sides of the inhomogeneity. The partial derivatives of the probability of identity are continuous across a geographical barrier, whereas the probability of identity itself has a discontinuity proportional to the partial derivative at the barrier, the constant of proportionality being a measure of the difficulty of crossing the barrier. © 1988.},

	abstract = {J. B. S. Haldane (Amer. Nat. 71, 337-349, 1937) argued that, in equilibrium populations, the effect of deleterious mutation on average fitness depends primarily on the mutation rate and is independent of the severity of the mutations. Specifically, the equilibrium population fitness is e-μH, where μH is the haploid genomic mutation rate. Here we extend Haldane's result to a variety of reproductive systems. Using an analysis based on the frequency of classes of individuals with a specified number of mutations, we show that Haldane's principle holds exactly for haploid sex, haploid apomixis, and facultative haploid sex. In the cases of diploid automixis with terminal fusion, diploid automixis with central fusion, and diploid selfing, Haldane's principle holds exactly for recessive mutations and approximately for mutations with some heterozygous effect. In the cases of K-ploid apomixis, diploid endomitosis, and haplodiploidy, we show that Haldane's principle holds exactly for recessive lethal mutations. In addition we extend Haldane's result to various mixtures of the above-mentioned reproductive systems. In the case of diploid out-crossing sexuals, we do not obtain an exact analytic result, but present arguments and computer simulations which show that Haldane's result extends to this case as well in the limit as the number of loci becomes large. Although diverse reproductive systems are equally fit at equilibrium, different reproductive systems harbor vastly different numbers of recessive genes at equilibrium and we provide estimates of these numbers. These different numbers of mutations may create transient selective pressures on individuals with reproductive systems different from that of the equilibrium population. © 1988.},

Both of these infections can be transmitted vertically from an infective parent to newborn offspring as well as horizontally via direct or indirect contacts with infected individuals. The vertical transmission mechanism plays a major role in the maintenance of these infections and its effects are analyzed in detail. This same mechanism can act as a means for controlling the size of the infected host population and an analysis of this effect is also provided. The sensitivity of the threshold parameters and the endemic prevalence rates of the disease to variations in the basic infection transmission components are investigated. The transmission components that are considered include the ability to transmit the pathogen vertically as well as horizontally, the size of the host population, and survival probabilities of the hosts. © 1988.},

A relatively complete analysis of infectious disease data is possible when it is assumed that the latent and infectious periods are nonrandom.

The first technique requires complete information on the epidemic, the second only the total number of people who were infected and the population size. Explicit expressions for the estimates are obtained. The estimates of the parameter and its associated standard error are easily computed and compare well with results of other methods in an application to smallpox data.

	abstract = {The dynamics of competing populations are investigated using discrete non-linear models with age structure. Necessary and sufficient stability conditions for the coexistence equilibrium between two competing non-interbreeding species are developed. An extension of this result shows that coexistence, which is not necessarily stable, occurs in terms of a simple geometric rule on a two dimensional phase plane, provided that each species reaches a stable equilibrium state in the absence of the other species. In the interbreeding case, analytical results are derived for a one locus, two allele model. Sufficient conditions for the stability of polymorphic equilibria are obtained. It is also shown that if both the homozygous genotypes have stable equilibria at fixation, then genetic coexistence occurs when the equilibrium heterozygous zygote production rate is overdominant. Harvesting can lead to the extinction of one of a pair of competing species, or to loss of genetic diversity in a panmictic population. When catchability increases sufficiently with body size, then harvesting preferentially removes the most productive genotypes, and this causes a reduction in the maximum sustainable yield of the population. Harvesting can also reverse the relative fitness of genotypes, since a rare inferior genotype in an unexploited population may be more fit under fishing. © 1989.},

It is shown that the mating pattern (the distribution of characters among mating pairs) established in a population as a result of the process of pair formation does not uniquely reflect the pattern of mating preferences. Quite different mating patterns may occur in populations with very similar mating preferences, as well as similar mating patterns may occur in populations with different individual mating preferences. The model demonstrates that not only mating preferences of individuals but also specific mechanisms of pair formation play an important role in determining the mating pattern of a population. © 1988.},

The buffering effect was greatest for species with the longest lifespans. The results suggest that wild ungulate populations will not fluctuate greatly in response to density-independent, environmental-driven vital rates. Such populations will reach high densities, thus experiencing strong density-dependent regulation, only a few times in many generations. © 1990.},

	abstract = {A model is presented for intraspecific exploitative competition among age classes in animal populations. The animals live for several time units and grown continuously in size until they die. Recruitment takes place at the end of each time unit. It is strictly synchronized, resulting in cohorts of age classes. Newborn individuals are similar to adults in shape and feeding behavior. The juvenile period lasts from one to several time units. The animals use renewable but limited food resources. The average niche position with respect to food size is a function of animal size. Overlap in resource utilization among the age classes results in exploitative competition. Besides a special case that can be treated analytically, the population dynamics is studied by numerical simulations. An increase in size independent fecundity rates or a decrease in the density dependence of growth rates tends to stabilize the population dynamics, that is when the population has a high rate of increase. An increase in the number of age classes tends to destabilize the population dynamics. In general, cycles or chaos are less likely to occur in our model of intraspecific competition in age structured populations, where death is assumed to be a continuous process, than is predicted from comparable models that assume a discrete death process. Furthermore, when characterizing the total variance of resource utilization of a population during one time unit, we define besides the three classical variance components, within-phenotype, between-phenotype, age structure, a fourth, temporal component. © 1990.},

	abstract = {Gene genealogy in two partially isolated populations which diverged at a given time t in the past and have since been exchanging individuals at a constant rate m is studied based upon an analytic method for large t and a simulation method for any t. Particular attention is paid to the conditions under which neutral genes sampled from populations are mono-, para-, and polyphyletic in terms of coalescence (divergence) times of genes. It is shown that the probability of monophyly is high if M = 2Nm < 0.5 and T = t (2N) > 1, where N is the size of ancestral and descendant haploid populations, in which case most gene genealogies are likely to be concordant with the population relatedness. This probability decreases as the sample size of genes increases. On the other hand, the case where the probability of monophyly is low will be either that of M > 1 and any T or that of M < 1 and T < 1, but the clear distinction between these conditions appears very difficult to make. These results are also examined if the gene genealogy is reconstructed from nucleotide differences. It is then shown that the results based upon coalescence times remain valid if the number of nucleotide differences between any pair of genes is not much smaller than 10. To observe such large nucleotide differences in small populations and therefore infer a reliable gene genealogy, we must examine a fairly long stretch of DNA sequences. © 1990.},

The conditions are interpreted in two standard formulations of a one-locus genetic model: a covariance approach and a structured population approach. A weak selection theorem is proved which says that m-stability can be calculated using the neutral covariances. These in turn can be calculated as relatedness coefficients; hence an inclusive fitness formulation is capable of checking m-stability.

Two models are described: (1) the "progeny-pair model," for the case of pairs of maternally-derived progeny, partially correlated for paternal parentage, and (2) the "mating-pair model," for the case of pairs of mates (and hence completely correlated paternal parentage). The progeny-pair model shows how correlated matings include both the covariation of selfing and the covariation of outcrossing-male parentage. Both components of correlated matings can be partially or completely caused by population substructure. The mating-pair model additionally shows that the level of effective selfing can differ between mates. The mating system parameters of both models predict the genotypic associations between pairs of sibs. The information about parameters provided by the segregation of marker genes is examined. Marker gene loci with two alleles do not provide enough information to estimate all parameters, whereas multiallelic loci do, with additional alleles generally reducing estimate variance and covariance. If some of the parameters are constrained via hypothesis tests, diallelic loci do provide sufficient information, and for multiallelic loci, the remaining parameters have reduced estimation error. © 1988.},

Recently researchers have used niche overlap measures as summary measures and for making inferences, typically about competition for resources. The problem of estimating niche overlap when the niches are multivariate normal distributions with equal covariance matrices has previously been studied. In this work, the assumption of equal covariance matrices is relaxed. Two general measures of similarity are evaluated assuming general multivariate normal distributions. Commonly used measures of overlap are given as special cases of these two general measures. The question of bias in estimating these measures is discussed and shown to be a potential problem, especially when there are many redundant variables or if sample sizes are small. © 1989.},

Four different approximations for large population number are presented. For frequent alleles, the standard diffusion approximation holds if all the evolutionary forces are comparable (Ethier and Nagylaki, 1980), whereas there are small Gaussian fluctuations about the deterministic trajectory if the deterministic forces, though still weak, dominate random drift (Nagylaki, 1986). For rare alleles, it is proved here that a branching process with immigration applies if the allelic numbers are small, whereas a diffusion approximation holds if they are moderate (Ethier and Nagylaki, 1988). The branching-process limit is established also for autosomal and X-linked loci in a dioecious population. Extensions and open problems are also discussed. © 1990.},

It is assumed that there is no delay in the effects of density. Assigning exponential, linear, or hyperbolic functions to describe the dependence of preadult survival and fecundity on density, nine models are obtained. The dynamics of the model resulting from using the exponential function to describe the density dependence of both preadult survival and fecundity is analyzed: for large values of the intrinsic rate of increase there may exist up to three equilibrium population sizes, two stable. This indicates that a life history with two episodes of density regulation can give origin to alternative stable states. The models are fitted to recruitment data from growth experiments of Drosophila laboratory populations obtained with the Serial Transfer System Type 2 (Ayala et al., 1973, Theor. Pop.

The variance depends on the sampling implicit in the mating system as well as on that explicit in the loci scored and individuals sampled.

Results are obtained for populations in drift and mutation balance, for infinite populations undergoing mixed self and random mating, and for finite monoecious populations with or without selfing. For unlinked loci in drift/mutation balance, variances appear to be lessened more by increasing the number of loci scored than by increasing the number of individuals sampled. For infinite populations under the mixed self and random mating system, however, the reverse is true. Methods for estimating the variance of sample heterozygosity are discussed, with attention being paid to unbalanced data where not all loci are scored in all individuals. © 1990.},

	abstract = {Selection on polygenic characters is generally analyzed by statistical methods that assume a Gaussian (normal) distribution of breeding values. We present an alternative analysis based on multilocus population genetics. We use a general representation of selection, recombination, and drift to analyze an idealized polygenic system in which all genetic effects are additive (i.e., both dominance and epistasis are absent), but no assumptions are made about the distribution of breeding values or the numbers of loci or alleles. Our analysis produces three results. First, our equations reproduce the standard recursions for the mean and additive variance if breeding values are Gaussian; but they also reveal how non-Gaussian distributions of breeding values will alter these dynamics. Second, an approximation valid for weak selection shows that even if genetic variance is attributable to an effectively infinite number of loci with only additive effects, selection will generally drive the distribution of breeding values away from a Gaussian distribution by creating multilocus linkage disequilibria. Long-term dynamics of means can depart substantially from the predictions of the standard selection recursions, but the discrepancy may often be negligible for short-term selection. Third, by including mutation, we show that, for realistic parameter values, linkage disequilibrium has little effect on the amount of additive variance maintained at an equilibrium between stabilizing selection and mutation. Each of these analytical results is supported by numerical calculations. © 1990.},

Coexistence turns out to hinge first and foremost on the difference between the time scales of resource and consumer dynamics. When the dynamics of the resource is discrete with a time step equal to or only slightly shorter than that of the consumers, temporal segregation of consumers does not make for their coexistence. Beyond a critical frequency of resource dynamics, coexistence becomes possible between completely temporally segregated species, and gets easier as resource dynamics gets more frequent (tending to continuity) and faster, and as the consumers are more efficient and more similar. When the time scale of resource dynamics is short enough, coexistence also becomes possible between species that overlap in time. However, there is a limiting amount of temporal overlap they can tolerate, which increases as their efficiency, their similarity, and resource availability increase. © 1989.},

The motivation for this paper is a condition obtained previously that initial increase of communication would require at least a two-fold advantage for the transmitted trait. Here, we show that under reasonable assumptions the invasion condition becomes less stringent. In Model 1, we assume that two adaptive cultural traits can be transmitted. A gene which permits communication of one adaptive trait modifies the expression of another gene which permits communication of the second adaptive trait. In Model 2, we assume that a related function such as greater memory capacity is a prerequisite for speech, and that this function confers an advantage independent of its association with speech. In both models we assume haploid sexual genetics and a simple scheme of vertical transmission. The stability properties of all corner and edge equilibria of the models are analyzed. The two models taken together suggest a possible scenario for the initial stages of the evolution of speech. © 1989.},

If the amount of pheromone is above a certain value, so that males become limiting, there are two positive equilibria; the larger is locally asymptotically stable, thus control becomes possible. As the amount of pheromone is further increased, these two equilibria merge at a critical release rate, above this value the pest is eradicated.

	abstract = {This article investigates some aspects of the shape of the functional responses of consumers that utilize two resources. Adaptive variation in consumption behavior is shown to have a major effect on the relationship between amount of resource available and its rate of consumption by an average consumer individual. The effects of adaptive variation are dependent on the nutritional status of the two resources. If the resources are linearly substitutable, increases in the density of resource i will usually increase the quantity, functional response on i divided by density of i, and increases in the density of resource j will decrease this quantity. The result is that the functional response to resource i will generally decrease with the density of resource j, and will increase faster than it would otherwise have increased with the density of resource i. If resources are nonsubstitutable, an adaptive functional response to resource i will increase with the density of resource j, and it will increase more slowly with the density of resource i than it would have without adaptive change. If resources are both complementary and substitutable, the functional response will exhibit ranges of smooth change separated by rapid jumps between values, and different ranges of resource densities will result in a functional response with the characteristics of linearly substitutable or of non-substitutable resources. Adaptive functional response shape is dependent upon the tradeoff involved in raising each functional response. These results have implications for the types of indirect interactions that occur between resources as the result of a common consumer's functional response. They also suggest that the adaptive response of competing consumers to each other will differ depending on the nutritional status of the resources for which they are competing. Implications of these findings for consumer growth isocline shape and several other issues are explored. © 1987.},

	abstract = {In this paper I develop a model that describes an evolutionary epidemiological mechanism and apply this model to the epidemiology of type A influenza. This evolutionary epidemiological model differs from the classical nonevolutionary epidemiological model which has been applied to diseases like measles, rubella, and whooping cough in having a novel mechanism which causes susceptible individuals to be introduced into the host population. In the nonevolutionary model, susceptibles are continually introduced into the host population by demographic processes: most hosts that die are immune, while newborn hosts are susceptible. In this evolutionary model, the susceptible class is continually replenished because the pathogen changes genetically, and hence immunologically, from one epidemic to the next, causing previously immune hosts to become susceptible. I derive formulae which describe how the equilibrium number of infected hosts, the interepidemic period, and the probability that a host will become reinfected depend on the rate of amino acid substitution in the pathogen, m, a parameter describing the effect of these substitutions on host immunity, γ, as well as the host population size, N, and the recovery rate, r. To apply the model to influenza, I show how the nondimensional parameter ε = mγ N r2 may be estimated from four types of data. The methods are applied to several data sets, and I conclude that ε ≪ 1; sampling variation and inconsistencies between the various data sets do not permit ε to be estimated more precisely. The evolutionary epidemiological model has no threshold host population size, in contrast to the nonevolutionary model. © 1987.},

The isolating mechanism studied has a monogenic hereditary basis, and depends on the fact that the various genotypes "choose" different periods or sites to perform their reproductive activity. In the one-population models, the "neutral" gene exchange between the two morphs characterized by the alternative forms of the isolating mechanism decreases drastically only when there is an extremely low frequency of individuals with different genotypes reproducing in the same sites and during the same periods. Furthermore, the reduction in gene exchange caused by the prezygotic isolation is smaller with tight linkage between the gene-determining partial reproductive isolation and the neutral gene. In the two-population models the prezygotic isolation causes a reduction in gene exchange which is smaller with low migration rates, and is negligible for very low rates. © 1987.},

(2) In the majority of populations for which data are available, the optimum becomes sensitive to variations in juvenile survival only in the range below 5 or 6%. This value is 3% and below for most Lepidoptera. (3) Many insect populations in nature show temporal variation in juvenile survivorship above these critical levels. Thus, in many cases variation in fecundity and survivorship will not translate into variation in the optimum and, therefore, should not keep the mean of the distribution of switching times from approaching the optimum. © 1986.},

With additive selection the same equilibrium gene frequency occurs in diploids and in haplodiploids with both once and twice mated queens. In haplodiploids if selection is nonadditive and strong, up to three polymorphic equilibria can exist; however, only a maximum of two are possible with weak selection.

The essence of the model is that interference competition at resource points lowers the rate at which foragers can load prey, thereby depressing the rate of food delivery to the central place. We show that interference leads to asymmetric payoffs when contests involve foragers with (i) unequal travel distances between the central place and the contested resource points; (ii) inequalities in the rate of food delivery available from alternative foraging sites; (iii) differences in loading efficiency; or (iv) different abilities to interfere. We use the asymmetries to predict dominance rankings, and the patch exploitation tactics of individual foragers. We also consider the implications of the model for changes in the travel distance (= area) over which foragers can exclude competitors (= territoriality) as food density changes. Finally, incorporation of interference permits our model to predict the transition between scramble and contest competition. © 1986.},

	abstract = {Linkage disequilibria for two loci in a finite island model were parameterized. The total linkage disequilibrium was decomposed into three components, gametic, demic, and population, for which corresponding unbiased estimators were established. Other statistics encountered provided measures of differentiation corresponding to the hierarchical structure of the ecological model. Under the assumption of linkage equilibrium, the variances and covariances of these estimators and statistics were formulated in terms of descent measures, functions of gene frequencies, and the numbers of individuals, demes, and populations sampled. The functions of gene frequencies fall into two classes, one representing the differentiation of genes at each locus, and the other representing the association of genes between the loci. For a neutral model with extinction, migration, and linkage, transition equations were derived for the descent measures which also take into account deme size and numbers of dems within the population. With the addition of unequal mutation rates for a finite number of alleles at each locus, the transition equations were solved for the descent measures in the equilibrium state. This permitted the exact numerical evaluation of the effects of the sampling and ecological dimensions and of extinction, migration, and mutation rates in any parameter range. Some numerical results were presented for the effects of linkage, extinction, migration, and sampling on the variances of various measures of linkage disequilibrium and genetic differentiation. Also, some results were compared with the approximate numerical results of Ohta which agreed fairly well in the parameter ranges she considered, but not so well in other ranges. © 1986.},

For comparison, a simple approximate procedure using a normal distribution is also presented. It is clear that in the long term truncation introduces departures from normality mainly through gene frequency change, rather than through the generation of linkage disequilibrium under random mating. The Gaussian approximation performs reasonably well for additive gene effects unless the mean gene frequency is very extreme (say, outside the range of 0.05 to 0.95) and the number of loci is small (say, less then 50) regardless of the type of selection in operation. The genotypic distribution at the limits to selection largely depends on the type of limit reached. If a limit is obtained due to the action of natural selection before the exhaustion of existing variation, the distribution will normally not be very skew, but if a limit is reached at which mutation plays a central role in the maintenance of genetic variability, it could have high coefficients of skewness and kurtosis. The role of mutation on the long-term response is also discussed. © 1987.},

	abstract = {A two-sex multiethnic stable population is a model with fixed mortality and fertility parameters that explicitly recognizes the behavior of males and females in at least two distinct ethnic groups. The presence of intergroup fertility may allow the different ethnic groups to grow at a constant rate in a population with a fixed sex-ethnic composition. The present paper considers a variety of rules for determining the ethnicity of intergroup births based on the ethnicities of the mother and father, and examines the mathematical models implied by those rules. Numerical examples are presented for a two-ethnic-group population in cases where intergroup births are shared equally by the two groups, are all considered members of one particular group, and are all members of the father's group. A special case of a more general model, where sons become members of the father's group and daughters become members of the mother's group, is also considered. The results suggest that when intergroup fertility is not uncommon, how ethnicity is determined can substantially influence the ethnic composition of the population. © 1986.},

	abstract = {A selection model for iteroparous, monoecious, or hermaphroditic plant populations is considered which encompasses viabilities, pollen fertilities, ovule fertilities, and rates of self-fertilization which may arbitrarily depend on both age and genotype. The general conditions for establishment (which are also those for protectedness) of an allele are derived. The classical conjecture that the conditions of protectedness are the same for separated and overlapping generations if the intrinsic rates of increase are applied is discussed. For this purpose it is necessary to introduce two new intrinsic values: the intrinsic rate of self-fertilization and the intrinsic pollen-to-ovule ratio. The significance of the intrinsic values is demonstrated for complete self-fertilization, selection restricted to differential, partial self-fertilization, and sexual asymmetry (absence of proportionality between pollen and ovule production), including selection restricted to one sex. With the exception of asymmetric selection in both sexes, it turns out that the intrinsic values suffice to state the conditions for protectedness, but more information about the life histories is required to determine the exact speed of establishment. For asymmetric selection in both sexes, the concept of intrinsic value is inadequate for investigating the problem of establishment and thus the evolution of life histories. Since sexual asymmetry is rather the rule than the exception and selfing is common in plants, the consequences for finding optimal life histories are outlined. © 1987.},

Similarly, selection strong enough to guarantee a two locus polymorphism with complete selfing does not necessarily guarantee a two locus polymorphism with intermediate amounts of self-fertilization. The results presented here and a brief review of previously existing results indicate that the predictions of population genetic models based on the assumption of random mating will not be greatly altered by a small amount of self-fertilization, unless the loci involved are tightly linked.

However, these are only two special cases from among the range of possible patterns of refuge use. We show the general conditions for when refuge use should have a stabilizing effect on Lotka-Volterra-type predator-prey systems. For a stabilizing effect, the proportion of prey in refuges must either: (1) decrease with increasing prey density, or (2) increase with both increasing predator density and increasing predation pressure. We also examine the effect of the cost of refuge use in decreased prey feeding or reproductive rates. Finally, we review some relevant empirical data and present some new data of our own. © 1987.},

It was necessary to reckon with seven quadratic genetic components, whose coefficients in the genotypic variance components within demes, σGw2, between demes within populations, σs2, and between replicate populations, σr2, are given by descent measures. The descent measures at any time are calculated with the use of transition equations which are determined by the parameters of the ecological model. Numerical results were obtained for the coefficients of the quadratic genetic components in each of the three genotypic variance components in the early phase of differentiation. The general effect of extinction is to speed up the time course leading to fixation, to increase σr2, and to decrease σs ̄2 (with a few exceptions) in comparison with no extinction. The general effect of migration is to slow down the time course leading to fixation, to increase σGw2, at least in the later generations, and to decrease σs ̄2 (with a few exceptions) in comparison with no migration. Except for these, the effects of migration and extinction on the variance components are complex, depending on the genetic model, and sometimes involve interaction of migration and extinction. Sufficient details are given for an investigator to evaluate numerically the results for variations in the quantitative genetic and ecological models. © 1987.},

This calculation applies in the limit where transitions are rare. Our results indicate that stochastic divergence is feasible despite free gene flow, provided that neighbourhood size is low enough. In two dimensions, the rate of transition depends primarily on neighbourhood size N and only weakly on selection pressure (≈sk exp(- cN)), where k is a number determined by the local population structure, in contrast with the exponential dependence on selection pressure in one dimension (≈exp(- cN √s)) or in a single deme (≈exp(- cNs)). Our calculations agree with simulations of a single deme and a one-dimensional population. © 1987.},

The effects of aggregation, dispersal, and nett growth are related to utility functions specific to each species, and to position on an appropriate axis. Utility, in turn, is defined by whatever underlying competition and resource-use models are being used. The analysis enables niche breadth, overlap, and shift, and different measures of competitive effects, to be explicitly related to underlying competitive models, and the method and meaning of regression-based methods of estimating competitive intensity are clarified. Detailed results are given, for a specific example, concerning the effect of exploratory behaviour, local competitive intensity, and niche separation on equilibrium population numbers, competition coefficients, and on niche overlap and its variation with overall population numbers. Niche overlap is shown to be no indicator of the competition coefficient. The results are shown to accord with observational data. © 1987.},

A review of the empirical evidence suggests that refuges are indeed capable of playing the former role. But the conditions under which they do so are not understood, nor is there any solid evidence for an effect on population fluctuations. The intuitive view that refuges act to stabilize equilibria and damp predator-prey oscillations is based in several theoretical studies of extremely simple models. Using a more realistic model, I show that several kinds of refuges can exert a locally destabilizing effect and create stable, large-amplitude oscillations which would damp out if no refuge was present. This finding contrasts sharply with the usual view. I argue that current evidence is too weak, and the range of theoretically possible effects is too broad, to justify any simple characterization of refuge effects in nature. Manipulative empirical studies are an important first step toward correcting this situation, and I discuss some important factors to consider in their design. © 1986.},

The rule causes the animal to stay at the patch as long as it is feeding faster than it remembers doing. The foraging behaviour of one animal, and of two or more animals together, feeding in traplines containing patches of the same and of differing types has been simulated, and in all cases the foraging behaviour generated by the rule allowed the animals to exploit the food very efficiently. The learning model is also responsible for indirect social interactions among animals sharing the same trapline because the feeding of each animal reduces the availability of food for the others. This causes a population of animals to disperse themselves, on average, among patches of food according to the ideal free distribution. The relationship between the learning model and conventional optimal foraging models is examined and it is shown that it is pointless to try to account for learned behaviour in the context of optimal foraging theory. © 1987.},

	abstract = {W. D. Hamilton (1967, Science 156, 477-488) calculated the optimum sex-ratio strategy for a population subdivided into local mating groups. He made three important assumptions: that the females founding each group responded precisely to the number of them initiating the group; that ail broods within a group matured synchronously; and that males were incapable of dispersing between groups. We have examined the effects of relaxing each of these assumptions and obtained the following results: (1) When broods mature asynchronously the optimum sex ratio is considerably more female biased than the Hamiltonian prediction. (2) Increasing male dispersal always decreases the optimum female bias to the sex ratio, but it is of particular interest that when moderate levels of dispersal are coupled with asynchrony of brood maturation then the optimum strategy is relatively insensitive to changes in foundress number. (3) When females cannot precisely determine the number of other foundresses initiating the group then the optimum strategy is almost exactly the strategy appropriate to a group of average size. These effects can be most easily understood in terms of local parental control (LPC) of the sex ratio. Through LPC a founding female can alter the mating success of her sons by altering the sex ratio of her brood. Asynchrony in the maturation of broods within a group increases the control that a founding female has over the mating success of her sons, whereas male dispersal reduces it. We have shown that the role of LPC and the role of inbreeding, which favors a female-biased sex ratio in haplodiploid species, are independent and that their effects can be combined into a single general formula r = (1 - ( r2 z2) E( ∂z ∂r)) (1 + I). The concept of LPC can also be used to interpret two factors which have been proposed to select for the Hamiltonian sex ratios: local mate competition is LPC acting through sons; and sib mating is LPC acting through daughters. © 1988.},

These models explicitly include plastic plant growth, the spatial distribution of individuals, and the fact that individuals interact primarily with nearby individuals. Because the models are based on submodels of individual plants (fecundity, survivorship and dispersal, and how these are affected by inter-individual interactions), they provide explanations of community-level phenomena in terms of the biology of individuals. All model parameters and functional forms may be estimated from data obtained in simple experiments of a single years's duration. The models are used to examine the community-level consequences of some types of inter-individual interactions that have been reported in the ecological literature. In addition, the models are used to demonstrate that dispersal may markedly influence the outcome of competition among plant species, even in a physically homogeneous environment, due to an effect of dispersal on the spatial distribution of individuals. © 1986.},

For example, enough environmental variance can produce stability without any genetic variability in the population. Or, with no environmental variance, a high cost of fighting between similar sizes or, for diploids, an increasing mortality with size may lead to a stable distribution of sizes.

No provision was made for the deletion of individual TEs within a host or for recombination, since both are relatively rare events in prokaryotes. These models mostly assume that the TE performs no fuction for the host, and that the reduction in fitness with increased copy number is due to effects such as the impairment of beneficial genes by transposition or homologous recombination. We also consider a model in which the TEs can convey a selective advantage to the host. The equilibrium distributions of copy number are determined for these models, and are of a variety of classical types.

The Monte Carlo computer model of this process was created and studied. We deal with two aspects of the speciation process: the development of reproductive isolation between the forming species and the extinction of the intermediate individuals. It has been shown that the advantage of the allele of reproductive isolation increases with the growth of its frequency. The extinction of the intermediates goes differently with various numbers of loci involved in speciation. If reproductive isolation is due to differences in two or four loci, then the completion of extinction of the intermediates requires the strongest disruptive selection, so that the necessary conditions for speciation found previousely are also proved to be sufficient. But with eight and probably with a larger number of loci, the selection required to promote speciation in a population that is far from it is considerably stronger than selection needed at the last stage of speciation. Consequently, under some intensities of disruptive selection the final state of a population depends on its initial state. The conditions under which the stationary state of a population is characterized by bimodal distribution of phenotypes are also found. © 1986.},

The alleles have additive effects on a character which is related to the exploitation of a food resource with a multidimensional quality description. Competition is described using the exploitative competition model of MacArthur and Levins. Directional selection favoring genotypes using resources closest to the resource mode will prevail as long as all genotypes on the average utilize resources far from this mode. When the utilization modes for all genotypes are close to the resource mode, then polymorphic genetic equilibria may exist. These equilibria can at most segregate m + 1 alleles, where m is the dimension of the resource quality description, except when special relations exist among the utilization modes of the genotypes. In these exceptional and degenerate cases curves of neutrally stable equilibria may exist, but in the general and nondegenerate cases the system converges to a globally stable equilibrium.

The evolutionary dynamics in two-locus sex-ratio distortion systems is enlightened: while equilibria with a sex ratio closer to 1 2 are more likely to be stable with respect to perturbations on the frequencies of sex-ratio distorters that are represented at equilibrium, such equilibria are also more vulnerable to the invasion of mutant distorters when there is some degree of linkage with the sex-determining locus.

When the parameters satisfy the invasion condition, the distribution of the population initially localized in a bounded area always evolves into a traveling periodic wave (TPW) with a constant speed. When the invasion condition is not satisfied, the population fails in invasion tending to extinction.

	abstract = {A stochastic model is developed for competition among organisms living in a patchy and varying environment. The model is designed to be suitable for species with sedentary adults and widely dispersing larvae or propagules, and applies best to marine systems but may also be adequate for some terrestrial systems. Three kinds of environmental variation are incorporated simultaneously in the model. These are pure spatial variation, pure temporal variation, and the space × time interaction. All three kinds of variation can promote coexistence, and when variation is restricted to immigration rates, all three kinds act very similarly. Moreover, for long-lived organisms their action is nearly identical, and their effects, when present together, combine equivalently. For short-lived organisms, however, pure temporal variation is a less effective promoter of coexistence. Variation in death rates acts quite differently from variation in birth rates for it may demote coexistence in some circumstances, while promoting coexistence in other circumstances. Furthermore, pure spatial variation in death rates has quite different effects than other kinds of death-rate variation. In addition to conditions for coexistence, information is given on population fluctuations, convergence to stationary distributions, and asymptotic distributions for long-lived organisms. While the model is presented as an ecological model, a genetical interpretation is also possible. This leads to new suggested mechanisms for the maintenance of polymorphisms in populations. © 1985.},

Previous applications of such techniques have involved human populations, with emphasis placed on identification of parent pairs followed by reconstruction of families. In natural populations, this approach is neither practical nor necessarily a realistic representation of population structure. It is proposed that for natural populations emphasis should be placed first on locating the most likely mothers and fathers for a given individual, then seeking the most likely pair among that subset of genetically possible parents. Thus the genealogy is ultimately represented as a set of genotype triplets consisting of each individual coupled with its mother and father. Mathematical analyses show a strong positive correlation between single parent and parent pair likelihoods within triplets; this result is corroborated by statistical investigation of data from a natural plant population. Therefore the practice of constructing parent pairs using only likely single parents is justifiable on statistical grounds. © 1986.},

The major result of this analysis is that regardless of how many alleles are present at equilibrium, new alleles will invade if and only if they tend to make parental investment in the two habitats more equal. In other words, the population evolves toward an Evolutionary Stable State (ESS) characterized by equalization of parental investment.

Ecol. 50, 461-471 (1981)) as two competing species distributing their progeny amongst patches according to independent negative binomial distributions. The resulting separation of the species increases the likelihood of coexistence. We have assumed a much simpler distribution of the competitors which has enabled us to explore analytically the dynamics of interactions with two competing species and a shared natural enemy in a patchy environment. Two types of natural enemy have been considered: a generalist predator whose dynamics are uncoupled from those of the two prey species, and a specialist (e.g., a parasitoid) whose dynamics are entirely coupled to those of its two prey. The following conclusions emerge. Non-aggregating generalist predators causing random predation across patches are generally destabilizing (although asymmetrical predation may in some case enhance coexistence as a result of preferential predation on the superior competitor). Predator aggregation in patches of high prey density, however, produces a switching effect which tends to promote stability. Coexistence is now even possible with high degrees of correlation in the distribution of the two prey and in situations of extreme competition where the competition coefficients exceed one. The main difference in the models with a specialist parasitoid as the natural enemy is a reduction in stability compared with the equivalent generalist-prey interaction. But stable coexistence can still readily occur if the natural enemies aggregate markedly in patches of high prey density. © 1987.},

Hestbeck, 1982, Oikos 39, 157-163) will stabilize population density: the dynamic interaction between social factors and (dynamic) trophic factors is analyzed. It is concluded that social factors such as the "social fence" tend to stabilize population density; hence, if density cycles (as, e.g., seen in many microtine rodents) are observed in nature, it seems reasonable to conclude that density cycles are driven by, for example, trophic interactions and not by social factors. It is suggested that the "social fence" may explain why so many populations including several microtine populations have fairly stable densities despite the ever-existing destabilizing trophic interactions. Contrary to what is implied by J. B. Hestbeck (1983, "A Mathematical Model of Population Regulation in Cyclic Mammals," Lecture notes in biomathematics, Vol. 52, Springer-Verlag, Berlin/New York), the analysis presented in this paper demonstrates that seasonal environmental changes are not essential for the generation of regular density cycles. Seasonal changes may, however, be necessary for generating a microtine-like density cycle. Empirical information on microtine rodents relating to the "social fence hypothesis" is discussed. © 1986.},

The effects of natural selection on population growth were evaluated using Ginzburg's fitness entropy function as a measure of the deviation of a population's initial allele frequencies from their polymorphic equilibrium values. This entropy measure was used to relate the dynamics of a community composed of evolving populations to the dynamics of a "reference community" whose populations are initially in genetic equilibrium. Specifically, a quantity called the "selective difference area" was defined as the total difference between the population size trajectories of a reference and evolving population. The selective difference area represents the amount of extra life a species would realize if the entire community were at genetic equilibrium. It was shown that this selective difference area is a simple linear function of the initial fitness entropies of each species. This prediction is independent of the strength of selection and holds for any arbitrary set of initial population densities. Numerical examples were presented to illustrate the results. Under the assumption of weak selection, a generalization for arbitrary population growth models was outlined. © 1986.},

Parallel change with net convergence is most likely when the competitors have similar constraints on the possible values of consumption rate constants, unequal allopatric abundances, and significant intraspecific density dependence. Numerical calculations of displacements are presented for several models and the effect of a number of different possible alterations of the model are discussed. The evolution of resource handling and processing efficiency, and displacement in the presence of additional selective pressures on the character are considered in detail. The results have implications for questions about maximization of population size, the relationship of character displacement and the competition coefficient, and "null" models in the study of competition. Differences between this and previous theoretical works are discussed. It is argued that conditions allowing parallel or convergent displacement are not biologically unlikely, and possible examples are discussed. Data on resource partitioning seem to be more consistent with the results reached here than with previous theory. © 1986.},

Most current work deals with two person matrix games. For these games the strategy set is finite. We consider evolutionary games which are defined over a continuous strategy set and which permit any number of players. Matrix games are included as a bilinear continuous game. However, under our definition, such games will not posses an ESS on the interior of the strategy set. We extend previous work on continuous games by developing an ESS definition which permits the ESS to be composed of a coalition of several strategies. This definition requires that the coalition must not only be stable with respect to perturbations in strategy frequencies which comprise the coalition, but the coalition must also satisfy the requirement that no mutant strategies can invade. Ecological processes are included in the model by explicitly considering population size and density dependent selection. © 1987.},

	abstract = {Since 1958 several wild laboratory populations of the housefly (Musca domestica) have been found which have single locus "autosomal" sex determination instead of the "standard" chromosomal mechanism. In western European populations of this species there is a north-south cline with respect to sex-determining mechanisms, from the XY-XX to the completely autosomal. In addition there is a similar cline with respect to altitude a.s.1. in Italy (Franco et al., 1982). This has stimulated a theoretical study of the action of selective forces on these polymorphisms. A series of two locus models have been considered. Assuming that the populations were originally all standard, we have attempted to construct possible scenarios for the establishment of this cline. In the absence of selection it is highly unlikely that such a cline would be established. On the other hand, in the presence of either meiotic drive or viability selection on genotypes, a population can shift from one sex-determining system to another, e.g., from male heterogamety to female heterogamety and to a two locus system. The sex ratio at some of the equilibria of the systems can be different from 1:1. The results are discussed with respect to the establishment of the above cline. © 1987.},

Simple differential equation models of competition between two consumers for such essential resources usually exhibit nonconstant competition coefficients whose magnitude depends on the parameters of the resource growth model. The equilibrium densities of the two consumer species are generally not linearly related. Constant competition coefficients can occur if the functional responses of a given consumer on the two resources differ by a constant factor. Differences between the conclusions reached by G. D.

Biol. 29, 235-261) is extended to include interspecific competition for space. The location and stability of steady states for the regional competition community are analyzed; a necessary condition for stable regional coexisitence of many species, and the condition for successful invasion of a new species into a region, are derived. General results are (1) the number of species that can coexist in a regional competition community is less than or equal to the number of distinct types of local habitats in the region and (2) for any pair of species coexisting in a regional community, say species-i and species-j, there is at least one place where species-i has a higher productivity relative to its larval mortality rate than species-j, and at least one place where species-j has a higher productivity relative to its larval mortality rate than species-i. A regional competition community consisting of two species competing for the space in two local habitats is analyzed using a graphical classification. If both local habitats are net "sources" of larvae for the regional populations of both species, then the qualitative results of interspecific competition on a regional scale are the same as those of the classical two-species Lotka-Volterra competition equations. If one of the local habitats is a net "sink" for larvae of one or more of the metapopulations, then additional results are possible: (1) The existence of a species may require the presence of its competitor. (2) A species which cannot invade an empty regional community may be able to invade if another species is present, and may then displace the first species leaving a regional community that again has one species. (3) A second species may invade a regional community containing one species with the end result that both become extinct. © 1986.},

These fluctuations may not be observed unless the composition of the population is determined at various cell densities. This paper gives a mathematical model for this behavior. In the model the decreases in the fraction of cells bearing plasmids record the appearance of plasmidless offspring cells of plasmid-bearing cells. The increases occur because plasmidless cells obtain plasmids from multicopy donor cells when the cell density is high. The periodic dilution of the medium necessary to permit continued growth of the population in test tubes repeatedly alters the balance of these two factors. The gradual terminal decline in the fraction of cells bearing plasmids is the result of a slight growth rate advantage of plasmidless cells. During the entire process the average copy number of the cells decreases, and the time lag before the final decline is the time required for the average copy number to approach one. © 1986.},

In the first model, each subpopulation has its own age-specific vital rates which are fixed in time. In the second model, the vital rates of each subpopulation are uniformly inhibited by increasing total numbers of individuals. In the third, the vital rates of groups of subpopulations are inhibited by the total numbers of individuals in other groups of subpopulations with an intensity that depends on the interacting pair of groups. Three functions are defined to measure disequilibrium in the subpopulation frequencies, subpopulation age structures, and total population size. For the first model, we show that disequilibrium will shift the trajectory of the total numbers of individuals forward or backward in time by an asymptotic constant that is proportional to the sum of the disequilibrium measures. For the second model, we establish sufficient conditions for the existence of a globally stable equilibrium and we show that disequilibrium will result in a finite loss or gain in life which is proportional to the sum of the disequilibrium measures. For the last model, we show that the loss or gain in life for each group of subpopulations is a linear combination over all groups of the sums of the three disequilibrium measures. We illustrate these results with numerical examples and give possible biological interpretations of the models. We relate these new results to previous work on the cost of natural selection and measures of demographic disequilibrium. © 1986.},

(2) An optimal switching time that occurs soon after a sharp increase in the number of individuals passing through the end of the sensitive period causes the most distinct optimum. (3) Early emergence from diapause (assuming a suitable environment) increases fitness, but neither the mean nor the variance of the distribution of emergence times affects the position of the optimal switching time. (4) Net fecundity, acting through the age distribution, can greatly influence the shape of the fitness function. (5) Populations with fecundity schedules of short duration relative to the length of the juvenile phase are likely to have fitness functions with plateaus and no distinct optimum, depending on the relationship between temporal changes in age structure and the predicted position of the optimum. The width of such plateaus diminishes as the variance of the emergence distribution increases. © 1986.},

	abstract = {Population dynamic models are developed for communities of annual plants in spatially heterogeneous environments. These models are constructed from submodels of the survivorship, fecundity, germination, and dispersal of individual plants. The submodels include the effects of spatially local interactions on plant performance and the spatial variation in performance caused by spatial heterogeneity in the physical environment. It is possible to estimate the submodels from data on experimental communities in either the field or greenhouse and so it is possible to empirically calibrate the population dynamic models developed. Each population dynamic model explicitly includes the spatial distribution of individuals in a plant community. Several two-species models for plants in patchy environments are studied to examine the community-level consequences of spatial heterogeneity in the physical environment. The results fall into two classes. First, community structure is in part determined by a relation between patch size and mean seed dispersal distance. Specifically, coexistence is, in some cases, possible only if patches are sufficiently larger than the mean dispersal distance. Second, community structure is also affected by relations between patch size and the maximum distance over which two plants interact (termed the neighborhood radius). In some cases, coexistence is possible only if patch size is sufficiently larger than the neighborhood radius. In others, the species coexist only if patch size is sufficiently smaller than the neighborhood radius. In still other cases, coexistence is possible only if patch sizes are within critical bounds, where the sizes of the critical bounds are in units of the neighborhood radius. All results involving relations between the neighborhood radius and patch size are direct consequences of the sedentary nature of plants and the fact that individual plants interact primarily with nearby plants. © 1987.},

	abstract = {A genetically induced niche preference is considered a factor in promoting polymorphism protection in a soft selection model. It is shown graphically that such preferences can notably increase the robustness of the model even for low or null within-niche selection coefficients. Nevertheless, it is also shown that in the absence of within-niche selection a polymorphism affecting niche preference, although it may be protected, would not be evolutionarily stable when faced with a mutant determining random niche choice. On the contrary, under these circumstances, random niche choice would be an ESS. © 1987.},

	abstract = {Organisms occupying and competing for space appear to coexist indefinitely on a relatively homogeneous and limited resource. Armstrong (1976) developed a mathematical model showing how fugitive species, with high recruitment rates and low interference competitive ability, can coexist with dominant species, those with high competitive ability but lower rates of recruitment. This and similar models of coexistence have not considered the case where competitive success is indeterminate, that is, where the poorer competitor can sometimes win competitive encounters. Armstrong's model and others considering coexistence of more than two species (e.g., Hastings, 1980) predict coexistence of multiple species at intermediate rates of disturbance and monopolization of space by single species at either very low or very high disturbance rates. This result is not true for a three-species modification of Armstrong's model. Under certain parameter values, a single species can monopolize space at intermediate disturbance rates as well. © 1987.},

	abstract = {The standard models of selfing in seed plants consider only the ovules, which are assumed to have a constant selfing rate. It has recently become clear, however, that hermaphrodite or monoecious populations frequently show sexual asymmetry (nonconstant pollen:ovule fertilities among individuals). Such asymmetry usually results in pollen selfing rates which differ from those for the ovules and are frequency-dependent even for constant ovule selfing rates. A recent study of selfing rates for all gametes of an individual is extended here to include four selfing rates (for ovules, pollen, all gametes, and zygotes), and simple mathematical relationships linking the four rates are obtained. Unlike earlier models of selfing, it is not assumed that the ovule selfing rate is constant, but instead that this rate, like all the others, is determined by the mobility of the pollen, which in turn is determined by the floral biology and ecology. It is found that all four selfing rates are usually frequency-dependent. The selfing rate for all gametes (the combined selfing rate) is usually intermediate between those for the ovules and pollen, and the zygotic rate is usually the smallest of the four. The exceptions to the above statements occur for relatively extreme situations, such as complete selfing for pollen or ovules, no selfing, or sexual symmetry. Three modes of selfing are considered: prior (PS), competing (CS), and delayed (DS) self-fertilization. It is shown that if there are at least two types with different selfing rates in the population, then the ranking of their selfing rates may depend upon the frequencies of the types (for the combined and the zygotic rates), may be frequency-independent (ovule rate), or may be dependent or independent, according to the mode of selfing (pollen rate). The effects of the various influences on the amount of selfing are by no means negligible. Thus a numerical study shows pollen selfing rates for one type which vary from 0.09 to 0.96, according to its frequency. Another numerical result shows a change in combined selfing rate from 0.13 to 0.86, depending solely on the mode of selfing. Results for Scots Pine show that an ovule selfing rate of 0.5 was accompanied by a combined rate of 0.143. The population selfing rate is not the same as the mean of individual selfing rates, and can only be obtained if female fitnesses as well as ovule selfing rates are known for each type. Previous models of selfing have failed to distinguish between the effects of increased selfing and increased pollen fertility, with the result that increased selfing always resulted in greater fitness. In the present models the two effects are distinguishable, and it is found that increased selfing may result in increased or decreased fitness, depending also on population density and on a form of pollen density. Thus the old dogma that in the absence of viability and fertility selection increased selfing always results in increased fitness is finally refuted, and the importance of the influence of ecological parameters on selfing and fitness is emphasized, since population density and pollen density influence the selfing rates. © 1987.},

A model capturing some of the general features of this process is formulated. Two major subsidiary variants of this model are analyzed. The first lacks competition between cells. In this case, the transferred genetic element can approach fixation asymptotically if cells bearing it are viable, but not otherwise. The second variant of the proposed model has competition. This gives rise to complex dynamical possibilities, but never fixation of the transferred genetic element. It is argued that the evolutionary transition from gene transfer polymorphism to obligatory genetic exchange, and thus the origin of sex, requires either population dynamics which are not subject to growth rate density-dependence or cell-dependence on transferred genetic elements, although such dependence does not require that the element be beneficial. © 1985.},

	abstract = {We investigated the dynamics of models of aquatic food webs using stability analysis methods previously applied to other types of food web models. Our models expanded traditional Lotka-Volterra models of predator-prey interactions in several ways. We added life history structure to these models in order to investigate its effects. Life history omnivory is different life history stages of a species feeding in trophically different positions in a food web. Such a species might appear omnivorous, integrating across all stages, but the individual stage might not be. Other important additions to the basic models included stock-recruitment relationships between adults and young and food-dependent maturation rates for early life history stages. Complex models of multispecies interactions were built from basic ones by adding new features sequentially. Our analysis revealed five major features of our multispecies, multi-life-stage models. Omnivory reduces stability, as it does in food web models without life history structure. However, life history omnivory reduces stability much less than single life stage omnivory does. Stock recruitment relationships affect the likelihood of finding stable models. If the maturation rate of young varies with their food supply, the chance of finding stable models decreases. Finally, predation loops of the type A eats B, B eats A, or A eats B, B eats C, C eats A greatly reduce model stability. We present both biological and mathematical explanations for these findings. We also discuss their implications for management of marine resources. © 1987.},

Results of these models include quantatitive predictions for both individual- and population-level sex allocation, an opportunity to study the magnitude of changes in predicted patterns as key variables change, and therefore an analysis of the robustness of Fisher's equal investment theory. One example is that Fisher's argument is extremely robust for high fecundity organisms, but, in low fecundity organisms, is sensitive to differences between the sexes in reproductive returns on investment per offspring, a situation that occurs in many vertebrates to which Fisher's theory is often applied. A second example is that individual- and population-level patterns often depend strongly on the distribution of resources available for reproduction among individuals in the population. © 1987.},

Parasitization of host larvae and adults forms another comparison. The models indicate that the release of sterile hosts alone is more efficient than release of parasitoids alone in controlling the hosts if population regulation is in the parasitoids; otherwise, the release of parasitoids alone is more efficient. The release of both steriles and parasitoids is much more efficient than the release of either alone for either suppressing or eradicating the hosts. This greater efficiency in combination rather than separately appears to be a special case of a more general principle, which is that two pest control methods will mutually complement each other if their optimal actions in reducing host numbers are at very different host densities. This is the case for sterile releases (optimal at low host densities) and parasitoid inundation (optimal at high host densities). © 1987.},

This is the same value as for two alleles drawn from a panmictic population of size nN. The average number of sites that differ in alleles drawn from the same and from different demes can provide some information about the degree of population subdivision, as is illustrated by using the data of Kreitman and Aquadé (1986, Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 83, 3562) on Drosophila melanogaster. © 1987.},

	abstract = {Commonly used life-table formulae for calculating the intrinsic rate of increase, r, and the instantaneous birth and death rates, b and d, give reasonable approximations for r, but not for b or d. An alternative, acceptable approximation is given for estimating r, b, and d when survival and fecundity are observed at discrete time intervals. The interpretation of b and d is problematic since both values depend on age-specific fecundity and mortality rates. We suggest that for inter- and intra-species comparisons the corresponding instantaneous cohort rates, termed bc and dc, should be used instead of the usual life-table values of b and d. If Ro = net reproductive value and e0 = life expectancy, then bc = Ro eo and dc = 1 eo. Life-tables for Daphnia pulex at five different food concentrations were determined in the laboratory. The various formulae developed here are applied to our own, as well as previously reported Daphnia data. Comparisons are facilitated by scaling the age by the mean life expectancy. © 1987.},

We study the dependence of optimal combinations of dispersal and germination on the environmental conditions if dispersal and germination rates are optimized simultaneously. Delayed germination is favored if population growth is low and fluctuations of the reproductive success in the subpopulations are positively correlated. Dispersal is favored if population growth is high and subpopulations fluctuate uncorrelated. If optimization is not done simulatenously but if dispersal or germination is kept fixed at a certain level, the optimal dispersal rate decreases with decreasing germination and the optimal germination rate increases with increasing dispersal. The results of the density-independent model are compared with the results of computer simulation for the density-dependent situation. A literature survey brought to light only few reported combinations of data suitable for testing the model. The best ones were found in Ødum (1978, "Dormant Seeds in Danish Ruderal Soils, an Experimental Study of Relations between Seed Bank and Pioneer Flora," Royal Vet. and Agric. Univ. Horsholm Arboretum, Denmark) and Grime et al. (1981, J. Ecol. 69, 1017-1061). From a combination of their data with information on dispersal capabilities it appears that there exists a negative correlation between dispersal and delayed germination in annuals, as predicted. © 1987.},

	abstract = {We present a general model for three interacting populations, where one population, called a mutualist, benefits a predator in its interaction with the prey. Biologically, there are four different ways in which the mutualist could benefit the predator: by enhancing prey growth rate, by enhancing the rate of prey capture, by providing an alternative food supply for the predator, and by enhancing the efficiency of utilization of prey, once they are ingested. We discuss examples of each type of interaction. We restrict our model to those situations in which the predator cannot survive on the prey in the absence of the mutualist. Therefore, if mutualism exists, it is obligate for the predator. Other conditions of the model include the dynamics of the prey and the mutualist alone and together in the absence of the predator. Given additional reasonable restrictions on the model, we determine the conditions for persistence, where persistence is defined as the continued existence of all three populations without any of them going extinct. There are two ways in which survival may arise in these models. Under one set of conditions, which is equivalent to the predator being able to invade a prey-mutualist system when rare, persistence will occur for any set of positive critical population sizes. Alternatively, survival will occur if there is an asymptotically stable interior equilibrium. However, the conditions for this are complex, and survival may occur only for initial populations in a limited region around the equilibrium. © 1987.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this study was to develop hypotheses concerning factors affecting the abundance of local populations in patchy habitats. Our approach was to propose a model of populations in patchy habitats that includes specific spatial relationships among patches (i.e., local or subpopulations). We considered six components of population demography and dispersal: (i) intrinsic rate of population increase, (ii) patch carrying capacity, (iii) fraction of organisms dispersing from patches, (iv) mean dispersal distance away from patches, (v) distance from which dispersers are able to detect new patches, and (vi) rate of immigration from outside the areas under consideration. We then conducted simulation experiments and analysed the results to generate the hypotheses. The following two hypotheses resulted. First, the most important determinants of average patch population size are the probability of dispersers detecting new patches (positive relationship), and the fraction of organisms dispersing from the patches (negative relationship). Second, the most important factor determining whether the exact spatial relationships among patches influence local population size is dispersal distance. If the average dispersal distance for the species is low relative to the average interpatch distance, the spatial pattern of habitat patches can have an important impact on local population size. Implications of the hypotheses are discussed. © 1988.},

Two new effects emerge: (i) It can be optimal to abandon the foraging trip without having collected an item, (ii) The minimum acceptable item depends on the time spent foraging.

In addition, the model provides several new predictions: The stable biomass distribution is independent of the environmental factors considered in the model and uniformly distributes the biomass among the size classes. The rate of approach to stability and the frequency of waves through the size distributions are a function of the flow rate and the variance in rate of growth and size at division. The model should provide a useful basis for studying the effects of size specificity on the dynamics of microbial populations cultured in chemostats. © 1984.},

Since the standard deviation tends to be much smaller than the mean, the following conclusions can be drawn. Aggregation lowers the number of mutant-containing clumps in cultures grown to a standard number of cells, but raises the number of mutant-containing clumps in cultures grown to a standard number of clumps. In the absence of mutation, or at low mutation rates, clumps tend to become pure types (normal or mutant). The probability of finding pure, nonmutant-containing clumps, however, is approximately the initial fraction of nonmutant cells (given realistic forward and back mutation rates). Also, in terms of the given process, it is possible to compute the probability that all the cells in an aggregate descend from a single, common parent cell within a given number of generations, and thus to calculate the probability that all the cells in a clone grown from an aggregate descend from a single cell within a known number of generations. © 1983.},

	abstract = {The optimal life histories are examined for models in which the average life-history strategy adopted by the population affects the costs and benefits of any individual's strategy. The situation modeled is one in which organisms can gain energy to be used in reproduction by foraging, but in doing so, they expose themselves to increased mortality; thus the proportion of time spent foraging can be used to measure reproductive effort. Simple models of a demographically homogeneous population are used to reexamine questions which have been studied previously using other models. The effects upon optimal reproductive effort of the following factors are examined: increased births per unit effort, increased mortality, and variability in population parameters. In addition, the questions of whether optimal reproductive effort maximizes population size and whether there can be multiple alternative life histories are examined. Results in most cases differ significantly from those of previous studies. No generalizations emerge regarding the effects of the three factors listed above. Optimal life histories in this model generally do not maximize population size. It is possible to have globally stable alternative life histories. It is concluded that frequency dependence will often be important in determining optimal life histories. © 1983.},

	abstract = {A model for the dynamics of a single species population of plants is proposed and its use demonstrated by the analysis of a simple example. The model incorporates the effects of microsite variation by allowing for individual differences in growth and death rates within each season. We demonstrate that an increase in the variance in individual growth rates may increase both the chances that a plant population will persist and the equilibrium size of that population. We also show that even if size-dependent death is occurring, it may not have a significant effect on the shape of the size frequency distribution. An extension of the model to multispecies communities of plants suggests an experimental procedure to determine whether competition is responsible for excluding a particular plant species from a community that appears otherwise to be suitable. A more detailed analysis of the model for a two-species community produces conditions for competitive coexistence reminiscent of those from the Lotka-Volterra competition equations. Another extension suggests that selection will favor those genotypes that maximize the product of germination probability and mass of seeds produced, if survivorship and growth are not substantially altered. Finally, an analog to r- and K-selection theory for animal populations is developed. Selection in low-density populations favors increasing growth rate, and in high-density populations favors minimizing the effect of neighbors on one's own growth rate. © 1985.},

Sympatric speciation is found to be possible in the case when difference in two characters is necessary for reproductive isolation. The influence of various factors on the process of sympatric speciation is studied and selection forces necessary for its completion are found. Speciation occurs more readily under the action both of disruptive selection in separate characters and of selection against individuals with "unbalanced" phenotypes. This type of selection is also most realistic when various phenotypes make use of different niches. The results obtained allow the supposition that the possibility of sympatric speciation is not reduced to a few cases when reproductive isolation between the forming species develops due to minor genetic differences. It is also shown that if one of the characters is not directly involved in the processes concerning speciation then the forming species do not differ in the character. Relative frequencies of the intermediate phenotypes are found for the terminal stage of speciation. © 1983.},

The optimal growth pattern which maximizes the total reproductive activity during the season is composed of the convergence of a plant's shape to a balanced growth path, followed by simultaneous growth of shoot and root (balanced growth), ending with the reproductive growth. Along the balanced growth path, a plant has a root/shoot ratio which maximizes the daily net photosynthesis for a given total biomass. The model also shows a simultaneous stop of shoot and root growth when the reproduction begins, the dependence of root/shoot ratio on age, water and light availability, etc., the convergence of a plant's shape to the balanced growth after pruning or an environmental change. © 1984.},

	abstract = {Different aspects and modifications of the definition of an evolutionarily stable (ES) strategy that have been considered in the literature can be incorporated in a unifying concept which regards the population context. This concept of evolutionary stability will generally characterize population states in both pure- and mixed-strategist models. In particular, it includes ES strategies, represented as a phenotype unique in an ES population. For an important class of mixed-strategist models, no strict ESS can exist. This will be the case whenever the success of an individual strategy is considered to follow as an average from the successes of its behavioural components. Instead, ESS results may be obtained from what will be called a "degenerate" form of the model, which is simply an ESS model on the level of elementary actions. Then, however, the correct interpretation of an ESS is not an individual phenotype but rather a population mixture of elementary actions. If an ES state exists in a mixed-strategist model it may be determined by an equilibrium condition; if there is an ES strategy, a different approach-mainly maximum considerations-is needed for finding it. An equilibrium condition does not hold for the components of an ES strategy straightforwardly; but it can be derived in terms of an auxiliary ESS model that considers first-order effects of the components. Several examples illustrate the significance of these results. Particularly, two models on "Games between Relatives" are reconsidered in order to display both their formal interrelation and the different meaning of their results in the context of mixed-strategist models. © 1984.},

It is assumed that each individual adjust has position within the macrohabitat so as to try to maximize a utility whose value is a function of position within the habitat and of the population density at that position. Robust qualitative conclusions concerning the resulting population behavior relate niche breadth, niche shift, and resource partitioning to changes in population numbers. In particular populations avoid competition by reducing coarse-grained niche overlap so that overlap is a measure not of the degree of competition but of its absence. Specific models of exploitation or interference competition give specific quantitative results which are summarized. Competition equations are derived from underlying models which imply Lotka-Volterra equations in a fine-grained environment (MacArthur, R., and Levins, R. 1967. Amer. Natur.101, 377-385) but which are nonlinear in per capita growth in a coarse-grained one. The findings are relevant to theoretical studies of competition, limiting similarity, species packing, and the evolution of niche position as well as to practical problems of data analysis and resource management.

This demonstrates that squared linkage disequilibrium is a highly variable quantity. The variance of homozygosity for a gene which consists of two sites can also be obtained. Recombination between these sites increases the variance of homozygosity, suggesting that intragenic recombination significantly changes all the expected moments of gene frequencies if 4Nμ > 1.0 and r > μ (where N is the population size, μ is the mutation rate of the gene to neutral alleles, and r is the recombination rate between two sites within the gene). © 1983.},

In each of the three cases studied (a predator delay, a prey delay, and both), local stability can persevere despite the presence of arbitrarily long time delays. This perseverence depends upon an interaction between delayed and undelayed features of the model. Delayed processes always act to destabilize the model. For example, prey self-regulation, usually a source of stability, becomes destabilizing if subject to a long delay. However, the effect of such a delay is offset by undelayed regulatory processes, such as a stabilizing functional reponse. In addition, the adverse effects of delayed predator recruitment can be reduced by the nonreproductive component of the numerical reponse, a feature not usually involved in determining stability. Finally, it is shown that long time delays are not necessarily more disruptive than short delays; it cannot be assumed that lengthening a time delay progessively reduces stability. © 1985.},

	abstract = {The effect of dispersal on population size and stability is explored for a population that disperses passively between two discrete habitat patches. Two basic models are considered. In the first model, a single population experiences density-dependent growth in both patches. A graphical construction is presented which allows one to determine the spatial pattern of abundance at equilibrium for most reasonable growth models and rates of dispersal. It is shown under rather general conditions that this equilibrium is unique and globally stable. In the second model, the dispersing population is a food-limited predator that occurs in both a source habitat (which contains a prey population) and a sink habitat (which does not). Passive dispersal between source and sink habitats can stabilize an otherwise unstable predator-prey interaction. The conditions allowing this are explored in some detail. The theory of optimal habitat selection predicts the evolutionarily stable distribution of a population, given that individuals can freely move among habitats so as to maximize individual fitness. This theory is used to develop a heuristic argument for why passive dispersal should always be selectively disadvantageous (ignoring kin effects) in a spatially heterogeneous but temporally constant environment. For both the models considered here, passive dispersal may lead to a greater number of individuals in both habitats combined than if there were no dispersal. This implies that the evolution of an optimal habitat distribution may lead to a reduction in population size; in the case of the predator-prey model, it may have the additional effect of destabilizing the interaction. The paper concludes with a discussion of the disparate effects habitat selection might have on the geographical range occupied by a species. © 1985.},

	abstract = {The deterministic properties of a two-locus model with mutation and selection have been investigated. The mutation process is unidirectional, and the model is so constructed that the genetic variation at one locus is selectively neutral in the absence of a mutant allele at the other locus. All genotypes with three or four mutant alleles are deleterious, while the double heterozygotes may have the same fitness as the standard genotype. If one of the mutant alleles becomes fixed in the population, then the other locus will show a regular one-locus mutation-selection balance. Such a boundary equilibrium may be unstable or stable in the full two-locus setting. In the symmetric case, which is analyzed in details, the population will either go to one of the two boundary equilibria, or to a fully polymorphic equilibrium at which both the mutant alleles are rare. The origin of reproductive separation between two populations via the fixation of complementary deleterious mutants at different loci, and the fixation of nonfunctional alleles at duplicated loci, are two biological processes which both can be studied with the present model. In the last part of the paper we show how the results from the deterministic analysis can be used to predict how different factors will influence the rates of evolution in these systems. © 1983.},

	abstract = {The one-dimensional linear homogeneous stepping stone migration structure is an important model in that it represents a short-range migration extreme for geographically structured populations and also serves as the underlying discretespace model for much of the work on continuous-space clines. We examine conditions for the protection of an allele under a stepping stone migration structure by using a recursive method based on Sturm sequences. Necessary and sufficient conditions for protection of an allele are found for a generalized step-cline selection gradient, which is the selection scheme used in much of the early cline work. Sufficient conditions for the protection of an allele are also found for (i) an advantageous patch at the stepping stone boundary which is followed by an arbitrary selection gradient, and for (ii) an advantageous patch embedded within an otherwise arbitrary selection gradient. We let m be the migration rate between neighboring demes. If within the advantageous patch WAa Waa = 1 + s, then for (i) s ≥ m (1 - m) is sufficient to protect allele A, even if the patch consists of only a single deme, while for (ii) s ≥ 2m (1 - 2m) guarantees that a single deme will protect A. If the advantageous patch consists of k demes, each with WAa Waa = 1 + s, then s ≥ ( π2 4) m k2 is sufficient for protection of A in (i), while s ≥ π2m k2 is sufficient for protection of A in (ii). Sufficient conditions for a protected polymorphism are found, and a bound on the level of migration is determined, below which a protected polymorphism exists, as predicted from Karlin and McGregor's (1972. Theor. Pop. Biol. 3, 186-209, 210-238) small parameter results. Finally, our patch swamping conditions (protection of an allele given a single advantageous patch) are compared to Nagylaki's (1975. Genetics 80, 595-615) conditions for the existence of continuous-space clines under analogous selection schemes and are shown to be identical for the two specific cases examined. We also discuss extensions of some of the above results to circular stepping stone migration structures. © 1983.},

	abstract = {The study of ESS germination fractions in S. Ellner (1985, Theor. Pop. Biol. 27, 000-000) is applied and extended in the case of annuals obeying the Reciprocal Yield Law. The effects of parameter changes on the value of the ESS germination fraction are determined in some limiting cases by analyses of approximations. Numerical solutions of the ESS criterion are used to check the robustness of the conclusions and the accuracy of the approximations. In general, the ESS germination fraction decreases with an increased survivorship of buried seeds and with increased "variability" of seed yields. However, different measures of "variability" are appropriate in different circumstances. To avoid the possibility of conflicting predictions depending on the measure of variability, it is suggested that tests of the theory be limited to co-occurring species, and to variability due to climatic fluctuations. The ESS theory based on the Reciprocal Yield Law is compared with D. Cohen's (1966, J. Theor. Biol. 12, 119-129; 1968, J. Ecol. 56, 219-228) density-independent theory of "optimal" germination. The theories differ qualitatively and quantitatively regarding the influence of mean yield, seed survivorship, and the frequency of favorable years on the predicted germination fraction. © 1985.},

In-phase solutions correspond to winter regulation of population density, whereas out-of-phase solutions correspond to summer regulation. Analysis suggests that summer regulation is possible only in mildly seasonal habitats. © 1984.},

	abstract = {Models for clutch size in species where a female deposits eggs into a larval resource of limited carrying capacity are developed. Previous models of clutch size related mainly to vertebrates (notably birds) where parental care limits clutch size. Our models cover cases where a single female "saturates" a larval food patch with larvae. The main predictions are that (1) extra eggs should be laid to compensate for larval moratility; (2) clutches should generally be smaller than the size that yields the maximum number of surviving larvae/clutch; (3) in species that gain resources for eggs in the adult stage, clutch size will be unaffected by age-independent parental mortality between clutches; (4) clutch size should reduce throughout life in species that gain resources for eggs before the adult stage; (5) similar species, but which are constrained to produce constant-sized clutches, should lay smaller clutches if their total potential egg production is low; (6) clutch size should increase with increasing search costs for oviposition sites. An ESS model of double-oviposition (where two females sometimes lay in the same larval food patch) indicates that the first female should generally lay more eggs than the second female; the difference in clutch size should decrease as the probability of double-oviposition increases, and should decrease as the search costs for larval food plants decreases. Many of the predictions have some support from data on insect oviposition. © 1984.},

	abstract = {The variances of actual inbreeding and coancestry in terms of their corresponding identities by descent were studied for finite populations. For inbreeding at a single locus, the total variance σ2 = F(1 - F) (F is the inbreeding coefficient) is comprised of a component σw2 within populations and a component σb2 between replicate populations. These variances increase in time to a maximum at about 1.1Ne generations for σw2, about 2.3Ne generations for σb2, and about 1.4Ne generations for σ2, and decrease thereafter (Ne is effective population size). The ratio σb2 σ2 is ever increasing to an asymptote in the range 0.4-0.5 depending on Ne and the mating system. For finite populations with variation in pedigree F's, there are contributions σwF2 within and σbF2 between populations. The component σbF2 is insignificant except for very small populations, and σwF2 is largest in the early generations and then decreases roughly as (1 - F)2 KNe where K is formulated in terms of the mating strategy and the degree of avoidance of mating relatives. An additional degree of avoidance increases K by a factor of 4. In a large population at equilibrium with respect to mixed self and random mating, σwF2 accounts for onehalf to two-thirds of σw2. Bringing in more loci leads to the decomposition of the total variance into four components whose values are affected by linkages among the loci. The relationships between these components and σw2, σb2, σwF2, and σbF2, are elaborated in terms of tight and loose linkage. The exact computations of σwF2 and σbF2 require the use of two locus descent measures without linkage. The variances of various averages of actual identities by descent, such as the proportions for individuals or populations, are formulated for a sample of individuals. © 1983.},

	abstract = {The nature of the functional response may be qualitatively understood as follows. Sigmoid responses to one food type may arise, in the presence of alternate foods, as a result of optimal feeding and foraging behavior. Sigmoid curves resulting from this cause I term class A curves. The same curve may also arise in the absence of alternate foods as a result of learning, individual variations in the level of food density at which predators begin feeding, or training effects. The latter I have termed class B curves. At very high food densities, a drop in food intake per predator might occur because of the tendency for predators to take easily found and captured items first and to become more selective when food is very common. Such "dome-shaped" curves have been found in the laboratory but should be rare in nature. Computer simulation of a three trophic-level system, using the phenotypic selection model of Emlen, indicates that natural selection acting on prey should encourage sigmoidality in the predator's class B functional response, at least in disturbed environments. The opposite force arises from selection acting on predators. However, given the magnitudes of growth efficiencies (see Eq. (8), it appears that at least for terrestrial vertebrates, selection on prey species is more important than selection on predators for determining functional responses. Accordingly, prey-predator systems occupying highly variable environments are expected to show more marked type III (class B) curves than systems in more stable areas. Finally, the role of functional response for prey-predator stability is discussed. Class A (alternate food) responses may result in population control for prey in multiple prey systems. Peterman and Pikitch have modeled systems in which type III functional response by predators, in systems where predation varies independently of prey, may lead to double equilibria. This picture is clouded, however, when predator populations are interactive with their food, though double equilibria are still possible (J. M. Emlen, 1984, "Population Biology: The Coevolution of Population Dynamics and Behavior," Macmillan, New York, in press). © 1984.},

This transformation renders the model linear with respect to the environmental variation, allowing ready solution for the ultimate population size and for the conditions resulting in stationarity of the population distribution. We show that for life tables where the fecundities of all adult age classes are the same (no restrictions are put on the survivorship schedule, or on the age at first reproduction), and where density dependence operates via total adult density, the realized growth rate is less than the growth rate calculated from the mean Leslie matrix associated with the population's growth history. The degree of the discrepancy increases with the environmental variability, and decreases with iteroparity, thus completing a proof which confirms the correctness of the initial conjecture for a class of biologically reasonable lifetable models. © 1984.},

It is suggested that the three modal distribution is explicable even on the basis of one major gene with three genotypes. The evolution of ethological reproductive isolation proceeded presumably from a high polymorphism in the most recent derivative of speciation towards increasing monomorphism of positive assortative mating among ancestral species. If an assortative mating locus combines with sexual selection of the frequent male adapted optimally to the local environment, then speciation and adaptation will be tightly linked in the evolution of mole rats. © 1984.},

	abstract = {An analytic model is developed to explore the relationship between gene flow, selection, and genetic drift. We assume that a single copy of a mutant allele appears in a finite, partially isolated population and allow for the effects of immigration, genic selection, and mutation on the frequency of the mutant. Our concern is with the distribution of the mutant's frequency before it either is lost from the population or emigrates. Before either of these events, the allele will be a "private allele" and would be found in only one of several populations in a larger collection. Slatkin [(1985) Evolution 39, 53-65] found several simple properties of private alleles in his simulations. We use the method developed by Karlin and Tavaré [(1980) Genet. Res. 37, 33-46; (1981a), Theor. Pop. Biol. 19, 187-214; (1981b) Theor. Pop. Biol. 19, 215-229] for a model similar to ours to obtain a diffusion equation with a "killing term" and obtain the mean and variance of the mutant's frequency and its expected frequency in samples of a specified size. There is only fair agreement between the analytic results from this model and those from Slatkin's (loc. cit.) simulations. The rescaling method used to obtain the results indicates that if emigration is relatively frequent, the distribution of rare alleles is governed largely by the balance between genetic drift and emigration, with selection, mutation, and immigration playing a lesser role. © 1985.},

This enables us to show that the idea that K-selection maximizes K is not valid as a general principle and is equivalent to asserting that selection on predators leads to prudent predation. Models of density-dependent selection, which predict maximization of K, implicitly assume no evolution of hunting efficiency. A valid general principle instead states that K-selection minimizes the equilibrium density of prey or food resource. It is then shown that the phenotypic profiles of r- and K-selected organisms are often identical. They diverge only if there are genetic constraints of a particular kind between the various evolving traits. Furthermore, divergence is in opposite direction to that which is commonly expected. © 1984.},

Thorough results are obtained for multi-strategy models in diploid, panmictic populations on the basis of multi-allelic, one-locus systems. A sexual population will be maintained at a phenotypic ESS if this can possibly be produced by the genotypes currently existing. If there is enough allelic variation, the corresponding gene pool may either be an ESS itself, or belong to an attracting, continuous set of states, which all determine the same evolutionarily stable population. The latter case allows new alleles to enter and spread in the gene pool without disturbing the phenotypic ESS. If a phenotypic ESS cannot be established, ESSs of the genetical model may be found which give rise to stable populations alternatively. Since these depend on the phenotypes determined by the currently existing genotypes, they may be destabilized by the occurrence of new mutations. In this sense, they are less durable than populations maintained at a phenotypic ESS and can be expected to evolve, in the long run, towards a phenotypic ESS. © 1985.},

	abstract = {Evolutionarily Stable Strategies (ESS) in phenotypic models are used to explain the evolution of animal interactive behaviour. As the behavioural features under consideration are assumed to be genetically determined, the question arises how underlying a genetical system might affect the results of phenotypic ESS-models. This question can be fully treated in terms of ESS-theory. A method of designing Genetical ESS-Models is proposed, which transfers the question of evolutionary stability to a "lower" level, the genetical basis. Genetical ESS-models - although nonlinear even in the simplest cases - can be analysed in a way that is familiar to ESS-theorists and yield immediate results on gene pool ESSs, which then may or may not maintain ESSs on the phenotypic level. Moreover, general results can be obtained to characterize evolutionarily stable gene pool states and their interrelation with commonsense, phenotypic ESSs. This part of the article presents the basic concepts and an outline of the method of genetical ESS-models. It gives, as a demonstration, a complete analysis for phenotypic two-strategy models (linear or nonlinear) based on a diploid, diallelic single-locus system under random mating. The results in this case suggest that a phenotypic ESS should indeed be expected to evolve but, maybe, only after passing through a succession of temporarily stable states. © 1985.},

To study the effects of parasitoid mortality and of limiting total number of eggs laid by a parasitoid, a standard criterion used in previous theories of optimal diet and optimal patch use, the maximization of the foraging rate, is no longer suitable. The model is solved analytically by using dynamic programming. The results are as follows: The host preference of solitary parasitoids depends on the mortality during handling times; i.e., the forager tends to avoid hosts with high risk of foraging mortality. If the total number of eggs produced by a parasitoid is limited, and if the mortality during handling is negligible, the host range is wider when a larger number of eggs remains in the parasitoid's body. In general, however, the mortality-cost of forager and the egg-cost interplay, because the loss of future reproduction by mortality increases with the number of available eggs. In an example with two host types, host range is widest with an intermediate number of eggs available in the body. The optimal number of eggs per host laid by a gregarious parasitoid is also affected by the differential mortality of the forager, and by the number of available eggs. © 1984.},

From the probability distribution of the partition, some old and some new results are derived concerning allele frequencies in samples. © 1984.},

A qualitatively accurate expression for the cumulative probability of extinction is derived in terms of a product of the species growth rate and the environmental correlation time. When this product is near unity, there is a much greater probability of rapid extinction. This appears to mark a natural division between r- and K-selected species and to suggest a reinterpretation of how their growth parameters evolve.

	abstract = {Genetic models are analyzed in which sexual selection is combined with fertility selection. In these models, the sexual selection acts on males, the fertility selection on either males, females or both sexes. The phenotypes thus selected may be determined either by dominant and recessive alleles or by each homozygous and heterozygous genotype. Polymorphisms of dominant and recessive phenotypes can be maintained in equilibrium by a balance between sexual and fertility selection. Generally fertility selection has a greater effect than viability selection in determining the point of equilibrium. The dominant phenotype is maintained at a lower frequency when at a fertility disadvantage than when at a viability disadvantage. When about 20% or more of the females mate preferentially, the models show that equilibria will be established at very different frequencies depending on whether fertility selection acts on males, females or both sexes. These results, applied to data of preferential mating of melanic two-spot ladybirds, predict differences in fertility which can be used to test the models. Symmetric models of preferences for each genotype also give rise to polymorphisms if the heterozygotes obtain an overall advantage. © 1983.},

	abstract = {An equilibrium of a time-lagged population model is said to be absolutely stable if it remains locally stable regardless of the length of the time delay, and it is argued that the criteria for absolute stability provide a valuable guide to the behavior of population models. For example, it is sometimes assumed that time delays have a limited impact until they exceed the natural time scale of a system; here it is stressed that under some conditions very short time delays can have a marked (and often maximal) destabilizing effect. Consequently it is important that our understanding of population dynamics is robust to the inclusion of the short time delays present in all biological systems. The absolute stability criteria are ideally suited for this role. Another important reason for using the criteria for absolute stability rather than using criteria which depend upon the details of a time delay is that biological time delays are unlikely to be constant. For example, a time delay due to maturation inevitably varies between individuals and the mean may itself vary over time. Here it is shown that the criteria for absolute stability are generally robust in the presence of distributed delays and of varying delays. The analysis presented is based upon a general predator-prey model and it is shown that absolute stability can be expected under a broad range of parameter values whenever the time delay is due to the maturation time of either the predator or the prey or of both. This stability occurs because of the interaction between delayed and undelayed dynamic features of the model. A time-delayed process, when viewed across all possible delays, always reduces stability and this effect occurs regardless of whether the process would act to stabilize or destabilize an undelayed system. Opposing the destabilization due to a time delay and making absolute stability a possibility are a number of processes which act without delay. Some of these processes can be identified as stabilizing from the analysis of undelayed models (for example, the type 3 functional response) but other cannot (for example, the nonreproductive numerical response of predators). © 1985.},

Conditions under which modifiers will not increase are presented in terms of the relative fitness of the sex-linked drive locus. To prevent the increase of modifiers, the fitness of Sex-Ratio males relative to Standard males has to be no greater than 0.3 and there has to be overdominance in females.

Generations are discrete and nonoverlapping; the analysis is restricted to a single locus in the absence of selection; every allele mutates to a new allele at the same rate u. Diploid-migration models without self-fertilization and with selfing at the "random" rate (equal to the reciprocal of the deme size in each deme) are investigated; in the gametic-dispersion models, selfing occurs at the random rate. It is shown for the unbounded stepping-stone model in one and two dimensions, the circular stepping-stone model, and the island model that the probabilitities of identity in state at equilibrium for diploid migration are close to those for gametic dispersion if the mutation rate is small or the deme size is large. Explicit error bounds are presented in all the above cases. It is also proved that if the number of demes is finite and the migration matrix is arbitrary but time independent and ergodic, then in the strong-migration approximation the equilibrium and the ultimate rate and pattern of convergence of both diploid-dispersion models are close to the corresponding gametic-dispersion formulae. For the strong-migration approximation at equilibrium, migration must dominate both mutation and random drift; for the convergence results, it suffices that migration dominate random drift. All the results apply to a dioecious population if the migration pattern and mutation rate are sex independent. © 1983.},

At equilibrium, both variances differ from that of a Mendelian population with the same parameters. In particular, when the cytoplasmic contribution from a male gamete β is small, as is found in most organisms, the effect of recombination between extranuclear genes is weak because of low within-cell heterogeneity. Then, the total variance for the entire population is large. Other important quantitites determining the variances are the number of extranuclear genomes per cell, n, and the number of cell divisions in a germ cell line per generation, λ. Unless β = 0, even a small contribution from a male gamete becomes significant depending on n and λ. © 1983.},

	abstract = {A model is proposed for studying the influence of the duration of a nonreproducing life stage on the dynamics of marine intertidal populations. Analysis of the model shows that this system, in which the time delay (the nonreproducing stage) is in a density independent term, has two solutions. When the nonzero solution exists it is a stable point. A randomly occurring environmental disturbance, to which only the nonreproducing stage is resistant, is superimposed on the basic deterministic equation. Average extinction time, estimated by simulation, appears as a a nonmonotonic function of the duration of disturbance. The graph of extinction time has multiple extrema with minima occuring where the ratio between the duration of the resistant stage and the duration of disturbance is an integer. This phenomenon is more sharply manifested when the intrinsic growth rate and frequency of disturbance are relatively large and when the variance in the duration of disturbance and the duration of the resistant stage is not too large. Increasing patchiness of the habitat has a minor effect on the pattern of dependence of the extinction time on the ratio between the juvenile and environmental periods. The suitability of the model for describing the marine intertidal system of the northern Red Sea is discussed, and it is suggested that the duration of the larval stage can determine adult population dynamics. © 1985.},

	abstract = {Two basic models of mutualism are presented in which interactions among three species lead to mutualism between two of them. The models represent 2-species predator-prey or competition systems in which a third species acts as a mutualist with either the predator, the prey, or one of the competitors. The models include the assumptions that there is a cost of associating with the mutualist and that the mutualist population grows much more slowly than the other two populations. Special cases of these two models correspond to six qualitatively different types of mutualistic benefit, all of which are known to occur in nature: deterring predation, increasing prey availability, feeding on (or competing with) a predator, increasing competitive interactions, decreasing competitive interactions, and feeding on (or competing with) a competitor. These models and their special cases are subjected to a local stability analysis. The results show that mutualism based upon deterring predation, competing with a predator, or decreasing competitive interactions enhances local stability, while mutualism based upon increasing prey availability or increasing competitive interactions reduces local stability. These results clearly reject the idea that mutualism is an inherently unstable process, and reinforces the idea that each different kind of mutualism will have to be considered separately. Compared to 2-species models of mutualism, the 3-species models provide a more realistic representation of the structure of many mutualistic systems, the mechanisms by which one species benefits another, and the regulation of the interaction. © 1984.},

	abstract = {Pollen and seed migration patterns are not the same in most plant populations, and the differences affect conditions for protection of alleles. We analyzed conditions for protectedness when pollen is freely exchanged along all demes, while seeds are deposited within the female parents' deme. Protectedness was analyzed at the boundary of fixation and necessary conditions were derived. If no selection among female genotypes exists, then simple average heterozygote superiority in the males can guarantee protection. However, regardless of the form of selection in females, simply doubling the male heterozygote superiority can still guarantee protectedness. Conditions for guaranteeing protectedness with female selection were also derived but are more complicated. The effect of inter-demic variability on protectedness of a biallelic polymorphim is studied for a particular method of reducing the variances of the selection values. It is shown that decreasing the variance of the female selection values also decreases protectedness. This is not necessarily true for the male selection values. © 1983.},

	abstract = {In annual plants, both seed germination (as opposed to dormancy) and delayed flowering are assumed to confer both greater and more variable reproduction. With this assumption, a simple model of these two characters, together with a reparameterization of survival and reproductive rates and a general approximation, leads to several predictions based on maximizing geometric growth rates. Each character optimum is a ratio of mean to variance of future reproduction, and the two optimums are interdependent, with compensation by one favored if the other changes. Optimal character variances, possible with prediction of future reproduction, are roughly squared correlations of characters with future reproduction, divided by variances of future reproduction. The optimal mean of each character is more sensitive to the other character's variance than to its own variance, and the optimal variance of each character is more sensitive to the other character's mean than to its own mean. Optimal germination is increased with better correlation between flowering time and future reproduction. A diffusion approximation for the single locus, single character genetic analog of the phenotypic model showed fluctuating natural selection to favor, in expectation and under suitable conditions, the allele frequency maximizing the geometric population growth rate. Conditions for a protected polymorphism at a second locus, controlling the other character, show genetic variation at the first locus favors alleles at the second locus adapted to greater environmental variability. Computer simulations check some results, and the general predictions should be relevant for studies of correlated life history characters. © 1983.},

While conditions for initial increase are independent of the rate of cytotype switching, the rate of evolution is accelerated by increased production of dysgenic individuals. If the transposition rate is sufficiently high to overcome the fertility barrier opposing P factors introduced into M populations, then convergence to high frequencies of the P factor occurs very rapidly. Under intense fertility depression, the phase of rapid increase may be preceded by an extended period of gradual increase at low frequencies. © 1985.},

Using these results we examine the progression in the behavior of the distributed-delay model as the distribution is narrowed toward the limit of a discrete delay. We conclude that while local stability properties approach those of the limiting equation very rapidly, the persistent fluctuation behavior converges more slowly, with the dominant period and maximum amplitude being least affected by the details of the distribution, and the fine structure of solutions being most sensitive. Finally, we examine the consequences for population modeling, and using several examples of insect populations, conclude that although quite often a full maturation-period distribution should be incorporated in a given model, in many cases a discrete-delay approximation will suffice. © 1984.},

The analysis of the model is supported by numerical iterations of the recurrence equations. The previous prediction of high linkage disequilibrium for small allele contributions to the character and close linkage between the loci is confirmed. For larger allele contributions results comparable to those for the symmetric viabilities model are obtained. The model degenerates when the allele contributions at the two loci are equal, i.e., in the most symmetric situation. The results are discussed as the outcome of a balance between optimizing selection and disruptive selection.

	abstract = {A model of the interactions between populations of temperate and virulent bacteriophage with sensitive, lysogenic, and resistant bacteria is presented. In the analysis of the properties of this model, particular consideration is given to the conditions under which temperate bacteriophage can become established and will be maintained in bacterial populations. The effects of the presence of resistant bacteria and virulent phage on these "existence" conditions for temperate viruses are considered. It is demonstrated that under broad conditions temperate phage will be maintained in bacterial populations and will coexist with virulent phage. Extrapolating from this formal consideration of the population biology of temperate bacteriophage, a number of hypotheses for the conditions under which temperate, rather than virulent, modes of phage reproduction are to be anticipated and the nature of the selective pressures leading to the evolution and persistence of this "benign" type of bacterial virus are reviewed and critically evaluated. Two hypotheses for the "advantages of temperance" are championed: (1) As a consequence of the allelopathic effects of diffusing phage, in physically structured habitats, lysogenic colonies are able to sequester resources and, in that way, have an advantage when competing with sensitive nonlysogens. (2) Lysogeny is an adaptation for phage to maintain their populations in "hard times," when the host bacterial density oscillates below that necessary for phage to be maintained by lytic infection alone. © 1984.},

	abstract = {Most quantitative traits in most populations exhibit heritable genetic variation. Lande proposed that high levels of heritable variation may be maintained by mutation in the face of stabilizing selection. Several analyses have appeared of two distinct models with n additive polygenic loci subject to mutation and stabilizing selection. Each is reviewed and a new analysis and model are presented. Lande and Fleming analyzed extensions of a model originally treated by Kimura which assumes a continuum of possible allelic effects at each locus. Latter and Bulmer analyzed a model with diallelic loci. The published analyses of these models lead to qualitatively different predictions concerning the dependence of the equilibrium genetic variance on the underlying biological parameters. A new asymptotic analysis of the Kimura model shows that the different predictions are not consequences of the number of alleles assumed but rather are attributable to assumptions concerning the relative magnitudes of per locus mutation rates, the phenotypic effects of mutation, and the intensity of selection. This conclusion is reinforced by analysis of a model with triallelic loci. None of the approximate analyses presented are mathematically rigorous. To quantify their accuracy and display the domains of validity for alternative approximations, numerically determined equilibria are presented. In addition, empirical estimates of mutation rates and selection intensity are reviewed, revealing weaknesses in both the data and its connection to the models. Although the mathematical results and underlying biological requirements of my analyses are quite different from those of Lande, the results do not refute his hypothesis that considerable additive genetic variance may be maintained by mutation-selection balance. However, I argue that the validity of this hypothesis can only be determined with additional data and mathematics. © 1984.},

	abstract = {A behavior or strategy which is evolutionarily stable must be both optimal and stable. The strategy must be optimal in that it maximizes the expected fitness of all the individuals using it. In addition, the strategy must be resistant to invasion by a mutant. The difference between the Nash solution of game theory and the ESS used in ecology is that the Nash solution only satisfies an optimality criterion and not an evolutionary stability criterion. We extend the ESS definition of Maynard Smith and Price so that it can be applied directly to two-strategy evolutionary games. The concept of a balanced game is introduced, and necessary conditions are derived which are similar to the Nash necessary conditions. The balanced game necessary conditions may be used for direct calculation of ESS candidates. These results are used to examine the optimal flowering time of an annual plant experiencing competition from neighboring plants. The plant competition model is general, and the results may be applied to a wide range of interference competition problems. © 1984.},

Diploid species do not have this intrinsic genetic bias toward eusociality. Nonetheless, true sociality has evolved in the diploid ancestors of the modern termites, and varying degrees of quasisociality are not uncommon in diploid species, including mammals. A genetic bias toward investment in relatives rather than offspring can arise in a diploid species as a result of inbreeding. The consequences of several regular incestuous breeding systems are analyzed in detail. It is shown that, under certain conditions, there is a natural bias toward an alternation of inbred and outbred generations. As this alternation proceeds, the genetic bias toward eusociality rapidly approaches an asymptotic value of 4(1 + 2f0) 3(1 + 3f0), where f0 is the average coefficient of relationship for the outbreeding pairs. For f0 close to zero, the genetic bias toward eusociality is close to 1.33, which is even larger than the genetic bias of 1.25 in haplodiploid species. Under other conditions there may be repeated incestuous matings between successive outbreeding generations. In this case the bias toward eusociality can be as large as 2. © 1984.},

The analysis of the model and several extensions of it suggests that such variation in consumption rates will often allow two or more competitors to coexist while limited by the same resource. For variability to promote coexistence, it is necessary that the time scale of resource population dynamics be fast relative to the time scale of environmental change. Variability is especially likely to promote coexistence if there is a large variance in consumption rates, negative correlation between the consumption rates of different species, and a linear or concave relationship between resource consumption and per capita population growth. Many previous studies which have found coexistence of two or more species on one resource can be interpreted as examples of coexistence due to varying resource consumption rates. © 1984.},

The species separate in a manner that relates to their intrinsic capacities to utilize the resources. Also discussed is the issue of species diversity gradients, and how the question of species discreteness might apply to it. The model with the Allee effect is in reasonable accord with island diversity patterns, but is minimally applicable to longitudinal gradients. Environmental stochasticity is modelled with noise terms governed by widely varying timescales. However, the resulting stochastic extinction is found neither to generate discrete distributions by itself, nor to have substantive effects on the discrete distributions generated by the Allee effect. © 1985.},

However, if the parameters of the population are determined by fitting the model to data collected from a growth experiment containing a mixture of the two species, then the model remains purely descriptive. It is attempted to make the model more informative by deriving its parameters from the eco-physiological properties of the individual species. Ecosystems where mutual shading is the most important factor causing differences in the photosynthetic capacities of the plants are considered. The eco-physiological parameters are defined in such a way as to make them measurable. For this reason, the analysis starts by treating the internal environment of a plant ecosystem as a state variable which changes with time. The metabolic function of the plants is considered by means of processes defined at a point on the plant, thus necessitating description of the state variables as space distributions. The analysis explicitly shows what kind of assumptions can lie behind the Lotka-Volterra model. Three examples are treated in which the information defined separately for each species is transformed by means of the Lotka-Volterra equations into information covering a mixture of the species. The result provides a method for quantifying the competability of different plant compartments in terms of eco-physiological concepts. © 1984.},

	abstract = {The genetic mating structure of a subdivided population can describe how parental genotypes gave rise to zygotes. When parents of the same genotype are considered together as one class ("open-mating"), three independent parameters of inbreeding and mating structure are needed to describe this structure at a diallelic locus. One is Wright's fixation index F. The other two are mating structure parameters, derived herein and termed the "effective selfing" rate E and the "inbreeding assortative selfing" rate D. E is the genetically equivalent proportion of self-fertilization at a single locus, and is given by standardized second and third central moments of gene frequencies of mates. E is a summary measure of inbreeding that includes effects due to self-fertilization and mating to relatives, as well as correlations between mates induced by Wahlund effects and/or selective diversification among neighborhoods. The second parameter D measures the tendency of inbred or more homozygous individuals to effectively self more (or less) than outbred or more heterozygous individuals. D is related to the maintenance of variation of inbreeding among individuals and/or to the prevalence of spatial variation of selection. D is independent of E, but together with E controls the generational change of inbreeding, ΔF. Extensions of the model to unequal allele frequencies in male vs female mates, and to multi-allelic loci, are also examined. © 1985.},

In this paper a model Yt + 1(ω) = Xt + 1(ω)Yt(ω) is considered, where Yt is the (column) vector of the numbers of individuals in each age class at time t, X is a matrix of vital rates, and ω refers to a particular realization of the process that produces the vital rates. It is assumed that {Xi} is a stationary sequence of random matrices with nonnegative elements and that there is an integer n0 such that any product Xj + n ··· Xj + 1Xj has all its elements positive with probability one. Then, under mild additional conditions, strong laws of large numbers and central limit results are obtained for the logarithms of the components of Yt. Large-sample estimators of the parameters in these limit results are derived. From these, confidence intervals on population growth and growth rates can be constructed. Various finite-sample estimators are studied numerically. The estimators are then used to study the growth of the striped bass population breeding in the Potomac River of the eastern United States. © 1985.},

Hamilton (Science 156, 477-488) for his local mate competition model corresponds in our inbreeding models to a weak form ESS (evolutionary stable strategy) fixation state and also to the population investment ratio at certain internal equilibria of our models. For haplodiploids, "strong form ESS" values exist under inbreeding in models involving father and sister control. Under brother and mother control, however, the ESS derived from local mate competition models is unstable in our inbreeding models to the introduction of any other investment ratio. We stress important qualitative differences between models involving local mate competition and inbreeding. © 1982.},

	abstract = {Four models of positive and negative assortative mating systems, exclusive or partial, in relation to phenotypes determined by a pair of autosomal alleles with dominance but with incomplete penetrance of the dominant allele in heterozygous state, are presented. By introducing the parameter of incomplete penetrance in the models of assortative matings, matings between individuals with identical genotypes will occur within the negative systems, as well as matings between individuals with different genotypes within the positive assortative mating systems. Thus, incomplete penetrance has the effect of retarding equilibrium on an assortative mating system, making this equilibrium equivalent to a system with a lower degree of assortative mating, where the penetrance equals 1 or 0. Another conclusion of biological interest drawn from the mathematical analysis presented in this paper is that for any value of the penetrance, the frequency of 0.5 for recessive individuals is also typical of exclusive or partial negative assortative mating systems at equilibrium. © 1981.},

The model used by Feldman and Cavalli-Sforza involves an arbitrary assumption. Consideration of the models of Wright, Fisher, Bulmer, and Lande in the context of assortative mating or of selection versus mutation shows that these models are consistent with each other. The treatment of the balance between mutation and normalizing selection by Cavalli-Sforza and Feldman comes to conclusions sharply different from those of other authors, apparently as a result of this same arbitrary assumption. © 1981.},

	abstract = {The logistic model, widely used for describing population growth, assumes that the per-capita rate of growth linearly decreases as the population size increases. Experimental data, however, suggest that often the per-capita rate of growth is not linearly related to population density. The theta model removes such linearity assumption by means of an additional parameter, θ; when θ = 1, the theta model reduces to the logistic model. We advance a method, the "jackknife" statistic, for estimating the rate of population growth (the largest eigenvalue and its variance) in the serial transfer system. Also, we propose a statistical method, PRESS, for quantifying the success of a given model in fitting experimental data. The criterion of success is the ability of a model to predict accurately new observations. One advantage of PRESS is that, contrary to what happens with other statistics such as R2, it tends to make a model less successful as the number of parameters increases (unless there is a disproportionate decrease in the bias of the new model). We have studied the rate of population growth in 25 genetically different populations of Drosophila melanogaster. The theta model provides a consistently better description of population growth in these populations than the logistic model. Moreover, the results indicate that the rate of growth is affected by the genetic constitution of a population. © 1981.},

Possible configurations of the zero growth isoclines are examined, giving special attention to the isocline shapes, the number of equilibria, and the manner in which the population approaches these equilibria. It is found that small increases in the density of one age class may have either a positive or a negative effect on recruitment into the other class, depending upon the degree of density dependence in fecundity and survival. Closely allied to this, an increase in the resources for a given age class may result in either an increase or a decrease in its equilibrium density. Strong juvenile-adult competition generally has destabilizing effects on the population's equilibrium, with the system being more sensitive to juveniles competing with adults than to the reverse. © 1982.},

	abstract = {The advantage or disadvantage of sexual reproduction or recombination for the accumulation of mutant genes in a population is studied under the joint effects of recurrent mutations, selection, and random sampling drift. To obtain the rate at which mutant genes are incorporated three different methods are used; numerical integration of Kolmogorov backward equations, simulation of stochastic difference equations, and Monte Carlo experiments. The first two methods are used in a two-locus system to obtain the fixation probability of double mutants and other related quantities under five different selection models. The third one is conducted for a multiple-locus system and the rate of accumulation of mutant genes per locus is studied. Comparison of the results between sexual and asexual populations shows that the effect of recombination depends on initial linkage disequilibrium, mutation rate v, selection intensity s, and population size Ne. The mode of selection is also an important factor and the large effect of recombination is observed when mutant genes are individually deleterious but collectively favorable. Under a given model of selection, the great advantage or disadvantage of recombination is achieved when a large extent of genetic polymorphism is produced not by mutation but by recombination. Extreme values of Nes and Nev make the effect insignificant. The results of Monte Carlo experiments also reveal the presence of interaction between selection and sampling drift even when the loci segregate independently and selection is multiplicative. Although this interaction is usually small, there are cases in which one locus theory cannot be used freely. In those cases, the effect of recombination is prominent and one locus theory gives an overestimate of the rate. © 1982.},

Natur. 101, 377-385) and thus provides a link between the theory of local niche partitioning and the theory of regional habitat segregation. The formulation is applied to a two species system consisting of a specialist and a generalist competing with each other in an environment composed of two different habitats. The analysis shows that dispersal due to directed movement toward a favorable habitat and density dependent random movement both facilitate coexistence. © 1982.},

In diploid species in which the primary sex ratio is fixed, protandry can evolve only through shortening the developmental time of males, so changing the distribution of their emergence times. Two models of the evolution of protandry in this way are compared. The first model assumes that the distribution of male emergence times can respond without any constraint to sexual selection, so leading to an "ideal free" distribution; the second model assumes that the distribution can shift only in mean (or possibly in mean and variance), but not in shape. © 1983.},

The results are interpreted in light of the verbal theories which predict the evolution of the sex ratio to a value which is proportional to the ratio of relatedness of the controlling members of the family to males and to females produced in the brood. In our models, the sex ratio in a certain class of polymorphic equilibria evolves to equal investment in males and females in those cases where the controlling members of the family are symmetrically related to males and females as predicted by the verbal theory. However, the sex ratio in the case of sister control in haploidiploids does not evolve to 1:3, but rather to a value proportional to the ratio of the regression coefficients of additive genotypes. Even so, the predicted sex ratio, which is proportional to 1:3, is in fact an "ESS" in the sense that fixation of a genotype specifying that sex ratio is resistant to the initial increase of all other genotypes. © 1981.},

	abstract = {The estimation of relatedness within social groups, such as the colonies of a population of social insects, is an important field for evaluating hypotheses concerning the evolution and maintenance of social behaviour. The methodology of this estimation from genetic data in the absence of pedigree information has been poorly understood; we develop this methodology for b, the regression coefficient of relatedness, and discuss its applications. Both b and G (the pedigree coefficient of relatedness) are potentially asymmetric coefficients, whereas φ, r, and FST are necessarily symmetric. We develop an estimator for b suitable for small samples, and also one for standard deviation, and examine the properties of both using sampling simulations. The b estimator returns values slightly below E(b), and the standard deviation estimator yields conservative confidence intervals. A comparative study of b and FST shows that, given the same set of data, b is estimated with greater reliability than is FST. As is the case for FST, b can be used to examine population structure at various levels, and b possesses the advantage of an estimator for its standard error, which can also be used to test for heterogeneity among the loci surveyed. The actual numbers of identical genes held in common by interacting individuals, and not simply their proportions, need to be considered in using coefficients of relatedness in inclusive fitness calculations. This necessity is handled by the weighted coefficients of relatedness, G′ and b′, which have been referred to in the literature as r (as have most relatedness measures). © 1982.},

It is shown through graphical presentation of numerically defined stability characteristics that the general consequence of this interaction is severe instability. Potential evolutionary strategies which restore system stability are examined by modifying the original set of equations and repeating the analysis. It is concluded from these results that there are at least two general types of stabilizing strategies: refuge and reduction of intergenerational flow. The latter strategy is further subdivided into diversion and dispersion tactics. These strategies may be ranked according to their tendency toward stable, single-point equilibrium as follows: Diversion > Refuge > Dispersion. Biological attributes of species illustrating these methods are outlined. Finally, the significance of these findings to other evolutionary strategies (e.g., r and K selection) is discussed. © 1981.},

	abstract = {Search tactics are explored for animals hunting randomly distributed prey in two-dimensional habitats. The predator chooses between two modes of search: continuous travel and alternating pause-travel. A model based on renewal processes is derived for the predator's net rate of energy intake. The model is used to explore the optimal mode of search, search height, pause duration ("giving-up time") and move length. Energy expenditure for search is assumed to increase from perchtravel over continuous travel to hover-travel. Prey detectability is assumed to be higher for the pausing than for the travelling predator. The following predictions emerge: The relative merits of the different search modes are mainly determined by the relative magnitudes of energy consumption rates and prey detection efficiencies at pausing and travelling. The energetically cheaper among two search modes reaches its highest relative merit at low prey density and detectability. As either increases, a more expensive search tactic may become superior. If the rate of energy expenditure increases considerably at locomotion, pause-travel tactics may be superior to continuous travel. This requires that the search can be performed from sufficient height, because net energy gain decreases rapidly below the optimum search height. It is greater for pause-travel than for continuous travel, and it increases slightly with decreasing prey density, and markedly with increasing prey detectability. With perch-travel or hover-travel tactics, the optimal giving-up time decreases with increasing prey density and detectability. The optimal move length increases with detectability. Empirical evidence coincides qualitatively with several predictions. Possibilities for further tests of the model are discussed, as are observed behavioural and morphological features on which the search model may shed light. © 1981.},

This result is an outcome of the interaction of the three ingredients in the models and it says that stochastic models of systems of patches can be expected to give results for average population density that differ systematically from those of deterministic models. The magnitude of these differences is related to the degree of nonlinearity of local dynamics and the magnitude of local variability. These results explain those obtained from a number of previously published models which give conclusions that differ from those of deterministic models. Results are also obtained that show how stochastic models of systems of patches may be simplified to facilitate their study. © 1981.},

Gompertz, Makeham, Brillinger, Wolfenden, Pollard and others have made contributions to this end. Model or reference tables perform a similar task, usually with fewer parameters, but are less easily manipulated. A common means of reducing dimensionality is to map the original space of mortality rates in five-year groups on a straight line in which are located the expectations of life at age zero ({approaches the limit}0). A small-space representation is advantageous for filling gaps in data. If the only fact known about a country is the fraction of girls who have a living mother, then a one-dimensional set can be indexed on this to provide the full detail of mortality, assuming the unknown mortality is part of that set. For forecasting one would like the succession of life tables for a given population over past times to be representable by points moving in a simple way through a parameter space-ideally in a straight line-over a succession of calendar years. The simpler the curve, the more realistic is likely to be its projection into the future. The Brass relational method provides a trajectory well suited to extrapolation in a space of only two parameters. Some useful extensions of this have recently been devised. © 1982.},

The precise effect depends upon the degree to which a predator's feeding history influences its reproductive success. The time delay intrinsic in difference equation models imposes constraints not found in differential models, however, it is shown that in an otherwise unstable model the inclusion of a sigmoid functional response can result in local stability. With the addition of prey self-regulation the stabilizing influence of the functional response acts in concert with self-regulation, as it does in continuous models. These results show that the effect of the sigmoid response upon stability is not dependent upon the assumption of continuity, and reinforces the view that sigmoid responses could be an important factor stabilizing natural communities. © 1980, All rights reserved.},

It is shown by considering the realised fecundities of the two types of males, at different frequencies in the population, that protected polymorphism for a locus controlling the male type is possible. However, it requires strong sexual selection and a distribution of group sizes with a high variance.

It is also applicable to other permanent structural heterozygotes that possess the mating systems discussed. Recombination occurs between the locus and the chromosomes, which are of two types. The mating system includes selfing and random mating. When recombination is rare, selection will result in almost complete fixation on the single most fit genotype present in a population, regardless of the frequency of selfing. This provides a possible explanation for the ecological success of permanent translocation heterozygotes in some groups of organisms, like Oenothera. It is not necessary to postulate that their success is the result of hybrid vigor. Furthermore, a complete lack of recombination is not necessary for explaining the observed association of alleles with particular segmental arrangements. A small amount of recombination is consistent with the observation that different segmental arrangements often carry different alleles. © 1981.},

These are used to predict the optimal sizes of foraging areas under conditions of different food densities. Only one of the models predicts an inverse relationship between density of food and size of foraging area when food is the limiting factor in colony reproduction. In this model, the foraging areas of adjacent colonies are assumed to be overlapping and the number of foragers assigned to each square meter of the foraging area is constant, regardless of food density or distance from the nest entrance. Tests for distinguishing among the four models, as well as for determining whether colonies are or are not food limited, are discussed. © 1982.},

	abstract = {An analysis by MacArthur (1969) of the dynamics of competing species has been extended to allow for the possibility that the species may change their pattern of resource utilisation in order to reduce the effect of competition. Minimising the same Q function as MacArthur it is shown that such readjustment of utilisation (segregation of the species between resources) would be advantageous to the species. Competition equations so derived are in general nonlinear and will give smaller competition coefficients than the widely used ones given by MacArthur's analysis. The results have implications regarding the limits of similarity of competing species, colonisation, and niche shift in response to competition. © 1982.},

	abstract = {A game theoretical model is advanced to explain the emergence time schedule of male butterflies under temporal "apostatic" selection, so that males emerging on different days enjoy equal fitness in evolutionary equilibrium. The model predicts not only the position of the peak date but also the shape of the male emergence curve for any given female emergence schedule. Where the female emergence curve is smooth with one peak, a flight season can be divided into an earlier phase, when some males emerge every day, and a later phase in which no male emerges. The male emergence curve is truncated at the boundary of the phases. The position of the truncation point is determined by the difference between pre- and postemergence mortality. Preemergence mortality also determines the rate coefficient of the decrease in sex ratio through the season. The model is applied to a well-studied population of the butterfly Euphydryas editha. The male presence curve fits well, but no clear truncation exists in male emergence, and some males emerge earlier than predicted. Reasons for deviations are discussed. © 1983.},

(The home-range utilization describes the relative degree to which different units of space are frequented by an animal.) Although previous methods have assumed specific unimodal distributions, such as the bivariate normal, home-range utilizations may resemble funnels or pies as well as hills. A regression method is introduced that uses data from well-sampled individuals whose true home ranges are assumed approximately known to predict home-range areas for less well-sampled individuals.

We say that an interval is "suitable" if the interval can be invaded by species two in the absence of dispersal by both species, and we say an interval is "unsuitable" if the interval cannot be invaded by species two in the absence of dispersal by both species. We offer three findings: (I) If one interval is suitable and the other is unsuitable, then the success of invasion depends upon the length of the suitable interval. Invasion succeeds if the suitable interval is larger than a threshold minimum and fails otherwise. (II) It is possible for species two to invade even though both intervals are unsuitable.

	abstract = {A deterministic selection model is considered for diplohaplontic populations which reproduce in non-overlapping generations and form zygotes by random fusion of gametes. The model allows for vegetative propagation as well as for viability and fertility selection in both the haploid and diploid phases. Fertility selection in the haploid phases is permitted to differ according to sex, and all selection coefficients are assumed to be constant over the generations. The main result obtained is that this model, including all of the above selective forces, is formally and analytically equivalent to and thus shares all of the properties of the "classical" viability selection model. This result is essentially due to the fact that when haplogenotypic frequencies in the sporophytes are considered in consecutive generations, all of the different selection forces can be expressed with the help of a single selection coefficient for each diplogenotype. The benefits from this simplification are demonstrated with the help of two examples for a single, multiallelic locus. Restricting selection to the haplophases only, it is shown that fertility selection acting in opposing directions in the sexes can lead to stable multiallelic polymorphisms without assuming spatial heterogeneity of the environment. However, it is unlikely that the conditions for this will be realized in actual populations for more than two alleles. The second example is concerned with the problem of maintaining several sexual types (males, females and bisexuals) in a population, with special emphasis on the conditions for the establishment of dioecious or monoecious systems of sexuality or a mixture of these. © 1982.},

In paternal species, where there are often clear economic benefits in obtaining good mates, mate choice mechanisms do not seem so highly developed. This is the lek paradox. We examine three forces, mutational load, migrational load, and two kinds of linkage disequilibrium, which might generate enough heritability to maintain a mating convention in a nonpaternal species, and we evaluate the strength of the selective forces they generate.

The presence of the exclusive resource serves to prevent the extinction of species 2 even when that species is at a great competitive disadvantage in obtaining the common resource. A feedback loop is established, dependent on the exclusive resource, making possible an increase in numbers of species 2 as the numbers of species 1 increase.

	abstract = {The relationship between persistent, small to moderate levels of random environmental fluctuations and limits to the similarity of competing species is studied. The analytical theory hinges on deriving conditions under which a rare invading species will tend to increase when faced with an array of resident competitors in a fluctuating environment. A general approximation scheme predicts that the effects of low levels of stochasticity will typically be small. The technique is applied explicitly to a class of symmetric, discrete-time stochastic analogs of the Lotka-Volterra equations that incorporate cross-correlation but no autocorrelation. The random environment limits to similarity are always very close to the corresponding constant environment limits. However, stochasticity can either facilitate or hinder invasion. The exact limits to similarity are extremely model-dependent. In addition to the symmetric models, an analytically tractable class of models is presented that incorporates both auto- and cross-correlation and no symmetry assumptions. For all of the models investigated, the analytical theory predicts that small-scale stochasticity does little, if anything, to limit similarity. Extensive Monte Carlo results are presented that confirm the analytical results whenever the dynamics of the discretetime models are biologically reasonable in the sense that trajectories do not exhibit unrealistic crashes. Interestingly, the class of stochastic models that is well behaved in this sense includes models whose deterministic analogs are chaotic. The qualitative conclusion, supported by both the analytical and simulation results, is that for competitive guilds adequately modeled by Lotka-Volterra equations including small to moderate levels of random fluctuations, practical limits to similarity can be obtained by ignoring the stochastic terms and performing a deterministic analysis. The mathematical and biological robustness of this conclusion is discussed. © 1981.},

	abstract = {A model of genotype specific habitat selection is developed for an organism subject to within-lifetime environmental fluctuations. Habitat selection is first overlaid upon both hard and soft selection Levene models with either discrete or continuous habitats. It is shown that even if all genotypes have identical physiological and fitness responses within a habitat, habitat selection can still maintain a polymorphism. In other words, physiological divergence is not a necessary prerequisite for divergence in habitat preferences. Within-lifetime environmental variability is then assumed to occur within each chosen habitat. It is shown that habitat selection acts as an evolutionary filter that can enhance the fitness impact of some niches and effectively eliminate the impact of others such that it generally increases the chances for a polymorphism under soft selection. However, density-dependent effects obscure the relationship between physiological fitness and evolutionary outcome. Indeed, it is possible for selection to favor an allele causing its bearers to preferentially go to the niche to which they are least physiologically adapted. Hence, changes in habitat preference can evolve before an organism has completely adapted physiologically to a new habitat. The fitness impact of habitat selection interacts with both homeostatic avoidance mechanisms (i.e., short-term buffering) and with tolerance (long-term) mechanisms. In general, habitat selection will be most favored in those organisms deficient in long-term tolerance. Moreover, habitat selection tends to accentuate selection favoring short-term avoidance mechanisms. Thus, organisms displaying much habitat selection should have poor physiological long-term tolerances but effective physiological short-term avoidance mechanisms. Finally, if the fitness costs associated with habitat selection are too large to be ignored and are comparable for all genotypes, habitat selection directs the selective pressures back onto the physiological homeostatic capabilities. Hence, the very existence and extent of habitat selection depends critically upon the physiological capabilities of the organism. © 1981.},

A number of new features of biological importance emerge that are not present in simpler models.

Hence, increased delays are not necessarily destabilizing. The variance in the length of the juvenile period is shown to be an important factor determining stability. Additionally, the relative stability of predation only on juveniles or only on adults is compared. © 1983.},

This problem is similar to the well-known traveling salesman problem: A salesman must choose the shortest path from his home office to all cities on his itinerary and back to his home office again. The traveling salesman problem is in a class of enigmatic problems, called NP-complete, which can be so difficult to solve that animals might be incapable of finding the best solution. Two major results of this analysis are: (1) The simple foraging strategy of always moving to the closest resource site does surprisingly well. More sophisticated strategies of "looking ahead" a small number of steps, choosing the shortest path, then taking a step, do worse if all the resource sites are visited, but do slightly better (less than 10%) if not all the resource sites are visited. (2) Short cyclical foraging routes resulted when resources were allowed to renew. This is suggested as an alternative explanation for "trap-lining" in animals that forage for discrete, widely separated resources. © 1983.},

This is not compatible with the standard foraging model. I present a stochastic model which incorporates predator training effects, and three types of training are explored: training in the ability to detect prey (search image formation), training in the probability of succeeding in an attempted capture, and training in the time to pursue, capture, and eat prey. The main result is that all three types of training can result in optimal diets which do not obey the standard optimal diet rules. Conditions under which these rules will suffice are discussed. © 1981.},

The other is to count only the direct offspring of a carrier, but to allow for the altruistic acts performed toward the carrier by its relatives (“neighbour modulated fitness” or “personal fitness”). A recent personal fitness model (L. L. Cavalli Sforza and M. W. Feldman, 1978, Theor. Pop. Biol. 14, 268–280) analyses parent-offspring and sib-sib altruism and concludes that k 〉 1/r is applicable only when fitness components are combined additively. The present paper analyses some simple models in which the phenotypic effects are carefully specified. It is concluded that it is sometimes, but not always, appropriate to combine fitness components additively. The relative roles of inclusive and personal fitness models are compared. The former have the virtue of being easier to think about in causal terms; and the latter of incorporating the evolution of altruism into the corpus of population genetics as an example of frequency-dependent selection. © 1980, All rights reserved.},

Foraging paths simulated in a patchy environment are shown to have the following properties: (i) They tend to avoid crossing the boundaries of patches from the inside.

	abstract = {A stochastic differential equation for a discontinuous Markov process is employed to model the magnitude of a population which grows logistically between disasters which are proportional to the current population size (density independent disasters). The expected persistence or extinction time satisfies a singular differential-difference equation. When the number of disasters, in the absence of recovery, between carrying capacity and extinction is two, analytical expressions are found for the mean persistence time. A comparison is made with the previously studied case of decrements of constant magnitude. When the two problems are suitably normalized, the mean survival times are quite different for the two models, especially in a critical range of initial population sizes near extinction. The expected survival time of a colonizing species is discussed quantitatively in terms of the parameters of the model. Insight into the nature of the probability density of the survival time is obtained by means of computer simulations. The densities resemble gamma densities and long tails appear when the disasters are density independent, implying a small change of long term survival. When the number of consecutive disasters which take the population from carrying capacity to extinction is large, a singular decomposition is employed to solve the differential-difference equation for the mean persistence time. The results are discussed in terms of population strategies in hazardous environments. © 1981.},

	abstract = {The evolution of dispersal is explored in a density-dependent framework. Attention is restricted to haploid populations in which the genotypic fitnesses at a single diallelic locus are decreasing functions of the changing number of individuals in the population. It is shown that migration between two populations in which the genotypic response to density is reversed can maintain both alleles when the intermigration rates are constant or nondecreasing functions of the population densities. There is always a unique symmetric interior equilibrium with equal numbers but opposite gene frequencies in the two populations, provided the system is not degenerate. Numerical examples with exponential and hyperbolic fitnesses suggest that this is the only stable equilibrium state under constant positive migration rates (m) less than 1 2. Practically speaking, however, there is only convergence after a reasonable number of generations for relatively small migration rates (m < 1 4). A migration-modifying mutant at a second, neutral locus, can successfully enter two populations at a stable migration-selection balance if and only if it reduces the intermigration rates of its carriers at the original equilibrium population size. Moreover, migration modification will always result in a higher equilibrium population size, provided the system approaches another symmetric interior equilibrium. The new equilibrium migration rate will be lower than that at the original equilibrium, even when the modified migration rate is a nondecreasing function of the population sizes. Therefore, as in constant viability models, evolution will lead to reduced dispersal. © 1983.},

Of the four examples presented by Maynard Smith, the case of alarm calls was shown to have a natural expression in our multiplicative framework, and to produce conclusions different from those expected under the usual additive assumptions. We show here that the examples of the sterile worker, and of parental care are both simply expressible in terms of our conditional probability approach. The fourth example, the case of incest taboos, will be discussed elsewhere. Using Maynard Smith's examples important differences between the results for the additive and multiplicative fitness constructions are revealed. It is concluded that the heuristic approach using "inclusive fitness" offers no substantive advantages over exact population genetic modelling. © 1981.},

	abstract = {A gametic model of quantitative character dynamics is introduced that fills the gap between the two existing models: genic and zygotic/phenotypic. In this model, a gamete is treated as the elementary unit of evolution, all biological processes at the levels below gametic remain unspecified, and a gamete is characterized by its effect on the quantitative character rather than by the genotype. The hereditary and developmental processes are accounted for in a generalized form by gametogenetic and developmental functions defined for a pair of gametic effects representing an individual. A parameterization of these functions is suggested that imposes constraints on the heredity of quantitative characters similar to the constraints imposed by traditional genic models. It is shown that this parameterization can be derived for some polygenic additive models. General expressions for the dynamics of the mean and variance of additive quantitative characters are obtained, and the dynamics under random mating for sex-independent, sex-controlled, and sex-linked characters are considered. Comparisons with the dynamics predicted by genic models are made. © 1982.},

Oaten's model is very general and difficult to understand intuitively. In this paper a simple, tractable model is considered in which the predator searches each patch systematically (without going over the same area twice) until he exhausts the patch or decides the patch is not very good. It is assumed that each patch contains a fixed number of bits, each of which may contain a prey. The number of prey per patch is assumed to have a binomial distribution with n equal to the number of bits and p being a random variable having a beta distribution. After searching each bit the predator decides whether to leave the patch or not according to how many prey it has found. In this paper the best strategy is determined and the long-term rate of feeding is compared with that of the naive animal that searches each patch completely. The advantage of being a Bayesian is determined for a variety of environmental conditions. © 1980, All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {A coevolutionary model of species packing is developed which allows evolutionary adjustment in both niche position and within-phenotype niche width of from one of three competing species. The environment is specified as a single resource dimension x and availability of resources along x is given by a Gaussian curve with parameters (x ̄R and σR). The model predicts that for S species the ratio of optimal niche width (ŵ) to σR is roughly independent of σR and can be approximated by 1 S when the competitors are completely resource limited. Niche separation ( d ̂ w ̂) increases only moderately with increases in resource diversity σR and is greater for two than for three competing species. To the extent that the competitors do not utilize all resources, both optimal niche separation and niche width decrease. Many of the general trends in niche width and niche separation predicted by this coevolutionary model parallel those from optimal foraging theory and limiting similarity models of community structure. The coevolutionary model stands out, however, in the singularly high values predicted for niche separation, making coevolved communities highly invadeable. Hence, the theory suggests, as some empirical evidence indicates, that coevolved competition communities can only exist as such on remote islands or in other habitats which might be free from invasion by outside species. For such communities, resource diversity (σR) should have much less effect on species packing than either species number itself or the extent that these competitors are resource limited. © 1982.},

	abstract = {This paper considers an animal foraging on prey which are distributed in well-defined patches. It is assumed that the environment may be stochastic and that the animal can gain information on patch type as it forages. The foraging policy which maximises mean reward rate for the environment is characterised in terms of a function of state called the potential function. This policy is shown to be given by the rule: continue foraging on the present patch while the potential is positive, when the potential falls to zero move on to the next patch. Let r denote the current reward rate on a patch and let γ denote the maximum mean reward rate for the environment. It is shown that r ≤ γ if it is optimal to leave. Conditions which ensure r < γ are also given. For a large class of environments the optimal policy is stated in terms of a revised reward rate r̃, and is given by the rule: continue on the present patch while r ̃ > γ, when r̃ falls to γ move on to the next patch. Finally, it is shown that the stay time on a patch is a decreasing function of γ. © 1982.},

The biological constraints upon these recruitment and death functions are specified, and they are used to establish results on stability, boundedness, and persistent fluctuations of limit cycle type. The relationship between models based on delay-differential and difference equations is then explored, and it is shown how well-established results on period-doubling and chaotic behaviour in the latter can yield insight into the qualitative dynamics of the former. Using numerical studies of two population models with differing forms of recruitment function, we show how, by making use of our results, it is possible to simplify the analysis of delay-differential equation population models. © 1982.},

	abstract = {Using the model of exploitative competition of R. H. MacArthur and R. Levins (1967, Amer. Natur. 101, 377-385), evolution at a gene locus which influences the niche position is considered. The locus has multiple alleles, and the contributions of the alleles to the genotypic value are additive. The resource spectrum and the utilization functions of the genotypes are assumed to be Gaussian. Evolution will make the mode of the niche converge to the resource optimum, as long as the allele contributions are small compared to the distance between the mode of the niche and the resource optimum. When this distance is of the same order of magnitude as the allele contributions, then the globally stable equilibrium will maintain at most two alleles in the population, unless the allele contributions are large. Classical overdominance is not needed to maintain polymorphism. This result predicts high linkage disequilibrium in similar multilocus models. It is concluded that intraspecific competition can be a powerful force in maintaining two-allele polymorphisms, and that it can maintain high linkage disequilibrium among closely linked loci. © 1980.},

We also show that an optimally hierarchical predator population can stably achieve a much larger depression of the prey below its carrying capacity than is possible for a simple predator population composed of identical individuals. This strongly suggests that socially structured predator populations may be more effective agents of biological control than simpler predators with no such population structure. © 1979.},

The indices called major-gene indices (MGI) investigated are functions of the deviations from midparental values compared to corresponding symmetric functions of the deviations from separate parents. Major-gene indices exceeding 1 may indicate some extent of major-gene inheritance, whereas an MGI less than 1 is suggestive of relatively more polygenic inheritance. Superposition of assortative mating and environmental effects will tend not to shift the MGI greater than 1 for polygenic inheritance, nor will they shift the MGI less than 1 for major-gene factors. The reliance on the proposed indices is reinforced on the basis of a hierarchy of representative models of monogenic and multifactorial inheritance. Extensions of the method to deal with multigenerational pedigrees are briefly discussed. © 1979.},

	abstract = {An analysis is made of the variation among individuals in finite populations of the proportion of their genes which are identical by descent. There are two causes of this variability: variation in pedigree among individuals, and linkage which causes whole blocks of genes to be identical or nonidentical by descent. The variation between and within populations is analyzed in detail for several mating systems: monoecious populations with and without random selfing, and dioecious populations with and without a hierarchical mating structure. Transition matrices for two-locus descent measures are given for each system. Total variability is obtained by integrating these measures over the distribution of map distances over whole chromosomes. Approximate methods are also developed for unlinked loci. Unless populations have a very small effective size (Ne) there is little variation in inbreeding between populations. For unlinked loci, the coefficient of variation in nonidentity within populations approaches about 1 √3Ne for random selfing, 1 √6Ne for monogamous matings and 1 √12Ne for monoecy with selfing excluded or dioecy with random pairing. If there is no association between map distance and initial heterozygosity or effect on quantitative traits, the coefficient of variation in mean heterozygosity over the genome is related to that in nonidentity, and the additional variation in a quantitative trait due to dominant genes equals the product of the square of the initial inbreeding depression and the squared coefficient of variation of nonidentity. © 1980.},

However, if we are concerned only with the number of alleles remaining rather than their frequencies, the problem can be reduced to the level of two alleles. General formulas for the mean, variance, and probability distribution of n, the number of alleles remaining after a given number of generations, are obtained and applied to various models of reproduction. For the Wright model of random sampling, n takes on a nearly symmetrical distribution during the early generations, with its first two moments easily approximated for moderately large (> 10 haploids) populations. Diploid systems of random mating, double first-cousin mating, and circular mating are also analyzed.

	abstract = {We consider a general model of a single-species population with age- and density-dependent per capita birth and death rates. In a static environment we show that if the per capita death rate is independent of age, then the local stability of any stationary state is guaranteed by the requirement that, in the region of the steady state, the density dependence of the birth rate should be negative and that of the death rate positive. In a variable environment we show that, provided the system is locally stable, small environmental fluctuations will give rise to small age structure and population fluctuations which are related to the driving environmental fluctuations by a simple "transfer function." We illustrate our general theory by examining a model with a per capita death rate which is age and density independent and a per capita birth rate which is zero up to some threshold age a0, adopts a finite density-dependent value up to a maximum age ao + α, and is zero thereafter. We conclude from this model that resonance due specifically to single-species age-structure effects will only be of practical importance in populations whose members have a life cycle consisting of a long immature phase followed by a short burst of intense reproductive effort (α ≪ ao). © 1980.},

	abstract = {This study investigates the effect of the functional response of resource consumers on the relationship between resource overlap and competition for some two-consumer, two-resource models. Two measures of competition are examined: α, the competition coefficient, and β, an index of the ease of invasion by the second consumer species when the first is at its carrying capacity. A comparison of systems with linear (type-1) and decelerating (type-2) functional responses shows that: (1) Competition coefficients are functions of the population densities of consumers or resources in systems with type-2 responses. (2) Competition coefficients may differ substantially in magnitude between systems with type-1 and type-2 functional responses. (3) The relative handling time of different resources is important in determining the relationship between overlap and competition. Positive correlations between capture rates (per unit resource) and handling times cause the system with type-2 functional responses to exhibit a higher level of competition for a given level of overlap than for the case of negative correlation. (4) If the functional response is type-2 it may be possible to obtain a priority effect in which either consumer species can exclude the other. (5) Invasion may be easier in a system with type-1 functional responses than in a similar system with type-2 functional responses, even when competition coefficients are larger in the former. Accelerating functional responses also affect the relationship between overlap and competition, but realistic models of such responses are likely to be very complex. Several currently accepted ideas in competition theory depend upon the assumption of a linear functional response, and are unlikely to be generally valid. © 1980.},

It has been argued that this effect is important in limiting the length of food chains subject to perturbations of the real world. We show that for an asymptotically stable system a lower bound on the return time is directly proportional to the number of trophic levels in agreement with simulation studies. In addition, the lower bound on the return time is shown to be inversely proportional to the sum of products of the intraspecific competition coefficient and equilibrium population of the species. A new method for directly computing the vulnerability of a system to external perturbations is presented. Using this method we demonstrate that for a food chain where the number of species is equal to the number of trophic levels, the return time alone is not a proper measure of system vulnerability. Indeed, adding an additional trophic level may make the system less vulnerable to disturbances. Interspecific coupling between the trophic levels is shown to be an important factor in determining system vulnerability. © 1979.},

What is required is some meaningful reduction of this total distribution. Whereas previous authors have considered extensions of kinship and inbreeding based directly on gene identity coefficients, we propose an alternative set of parameters based on the survival and extinction of sets of genes, and correlations in such extinction or survival. These correlations illuminate directly the nonindependence of gene descent in pedigrees, and this is a factor of prime importance in the evolution of small populations. These correlations are investigated under a variety of mating systems, under "outbreeding" and "random-mating" populations, and in the actual population of Tristan da Cunha. © 1979.},

Two other special cases are considered, one of which seems to be applicable to populations with a structure like that of the Yanomama Indians of South America. We then investigate the expected frequency spectra under these three special cases and discover that all three models yield a broad range of possible spectra with overlap between the special cases.

	abstract = {The possibility of equilibrium is studied for model assemblages of competing species and their resources. The "assemblage niche" is defined as the set of resource productivities which yields an equilibrium population exceeding zero for all species. A radius of this set, which is a measure of the ability of the assemblage to have equilibrium states, is defined and estimated. This radius decreases as resource utilization overlap increases; the behavior is compared with known results concerning response to rapid resource fluctuations. A system of ordinary differential equations having such an equilibrium is studied. It is shown that a global asymptotic stability property holds in regions with boundaries defined by a certain scalar function, if the specific productivity satisfies a monotonicity condition. This generalizes known results, which have been obtained for antisymmetric Lotka-Volterra systems. © 1979.},

	abstract = {This paper studies lines of descent in the diffusion approximation of neutral Wright-Fisher models where the mutation rate away from each gene per generation is the same. Here a line of descent begins with a single gene and has branches at each generation where genes are reproduced from a parent in the line. New mutations are not included in a line of descent but are considered to begin a new line. The joint distribution of the number of lines of descent surviving in a population from time 0 to time t and the frequencies in these lines is derived. Expected times between loss of lines of descent are found. The distribution of the number of lines of descent in a sample from the population is derived. This leads to the distribution of the number of types in a sample from a nonstationary infinite alleles population. © 1980.},

Studied in detail is the case where the sizes of the two descendant populations are equal to that of the ancestral population and the mutation rate is the same for all loci. Numerical computations are carried out by using the present formulas and those of Li and Nei (1975 Genet. Res. 25) for the infinite-allele model. The results are as follows: The correlation of heterozygosity decreases with time faster for the stepwise mutation model than for the infinite-allele model. However, the relationships between the correlation of heterozygosity and the normalized genetic identity for the two models are very similar, if the average heterozygosities of the two populations are around 0.20 or less. On the other hand, the variance of genetic distance for the stepwise mutation model may become considerably smaller than that for the infinite-allele model, if the average heterozygosities of the two populations are larger than 0.05. The ratio of the standard deviation to the mean is, however, very large for the stepwise mutation model as well as the infinite-allele model. © 1979.},

	abstract = {An unselective harvest is sustainable if the per capita removal rate balances the net per capita growth rate of the population. If the function relating the growth rate to population density is known, finding the density at which the maximal total harvest rate may be achieved is a simple exercise in parameter optimization. In age-structured populations the per capita growth rate is related in a complicated way to the age-specific vital rates upon which density feedbacks directly operate. Generally, the function relating the per capita growth rate to density will resemble a log transform of the function relating age-specific fecundities to density. Accordingly, maximum yield is attained at a population density that is closer to the saturation density than we would expect on the basis simply of substituting the functional form of the density dependence of fecundity into the parameter optimization model derived for the case without age structure. The amount of the discrepancy increases with the intensity of the density feedback and with the degree to which the reproduction of a cohort is dominated by reproduction taking place during a span of ages that is small relative to the generation time. © 1980, All rights reserved.},

If the population size regulating mechanism reacts too sharply to perturbations in population size, regular and chaotic limit cycles may result. It is established analytically that the population may converge to fixation or an invariant polymorphic gene frequency while the population size undergoes regular or chaotic oscillations. The possibility of joint limit cycles in both the population size and gene frequency is demonstrated and investigated numerically. Such cycles may occur even though one or both fixation equilibria are locally stable. In the context of equilibrium cycles it is found that overdominance in carrying capacity is not necessary for the maintenance of genetic variation in the population. Furthermore, the genetic system appears able to exert a stabilizing influence on the overall system. © 1979.},

The neutral model and also a model with heterozygote selection are considered. Some observed ABO blood group allele frequencies are compared with the tabulated expected frequencies in the neutral three allele model. This extends the results of Watterson and Guess (1977) who tabulate the expected value of the most common allele. One test of neutrality previously advocated is to consider the distribution of F, the population homozygosity, conditional on G, the product of allele frequencies. However it is shown here that for a large number of alleles, F and G are asymptotically independent, the test would not be a good one in this case. A limit theorem is derived for the distribution of allele frequencies in the neutral model when the mutation rate is large. In this case F is shown to be asymptotically normal. An inequality is derived for the probability that the oldest allele in a population is amongst the r most frequent types. An inequality is also found for the probability that a sample will only contain representatives of the r most frequent allele types in the population. © 1979.},

At each amino acid position the mutation rate from one charge state to the other is v. We derive the expected variance in charge, for a population of N individuals in generation t, which is α2(t) = [2MNv/(1 + 8Nv)]{1 − exp[−(4v + 1/2N)t]} for an initially monomorphic population. This variance, which is unaffected by intragenic recombination and gene conversion, does not increase linearly with N as does the steady-state variance in charge for the older electrophoretic models. We also derive the probability, Pj(t), that a random gene in a population exceeds another by j charge units. We conclude: (1) that, except for species which have maintained effective population numbers in the millions, the infinite mutable sites model adequately describes “neutral” genetic variation; (2) that very high levels of “neutral” genetic variation can be attained only by genes with a fairly large number of “neutral” amino acid sites in species which have maintained an effective size in the millions for millions of generations; (3) that, because all species surveyed have a mean heterozygosity of less than 25 %, it is likely that most genes have only a few “neutral” covarions. © 1980, All rights reserved.},

If it is assumed that the per capita growth rate of a population changes over time as a result of regulating factors impinging on it, then a more realistic biological model results. The model translates into a second-order nonlinear ODE. Such a model can exhibit oscillatory and limit cycle as well as monotonic solutions, i.e., behavior for which non-ODE models have been used to explain. Although first-order ODE models are gross simplifications of real phenomena, ODE models in general should not be disregarded as important analytical tools. © 1980, All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {An energy-based model of feeding territoriality is described. The model predicts an optimal territory size where the territory holder's net energy intake is maximized, on a daily or seasonal time scale. Simulated effects on optimal territory size of animal size, food availability, and competitor density are in general agreement with observed relationships in a wide variety of animals. When salmonid data are used to estimate the model parameter values, predicted territory sizes are similar to those actually observed. When emigration is allowed, the model predicts that territoriality, through individual selection alone, can regulate population size, but that this regulation breaks down when initial densities exceed some threshold value. Sensitivity analysis shows optimal territory size to be most affected by those parameters influencing food intake and energy expenditure. Some alternative criteria for optimization are also discussed. An animal maximizing net foraging efficiency has a smaller territory than one maximizing net energy, but the effects of animal size, food availability, and competitor density on territory size are the same in either case. © 1978.},

A number of qualitative and comparative properties of the equilibrium covariance structure are set forth. In particular, it is shown that the phenotype variance generally increases under attenuated assortative mating tendencies and for an increased level of parent-offspring transmission. Moreover, with more contrasting sex-dependent transmission the sibling covariances diverge from the parent-offspring covariance. Also, shared residual-environmental covariance enhances the sibling covariances. The absolute product moment of the deviation of a child phenotype from the separate parental phenotypes exhibits a minimum for a mixed assortative random mating scheme rather than under extreme assortative mating or pure random mating. We establish that the equilibrium variance of a married individual is reduced compared to the variance of the population at large. Interpretations and implications are discussed. © 1979.},

This paper explores optimal foraging in patches containing several different kinds of prey. Results obtained by simulation show that deviations from recent predictions are to be expected, particularly for long interpatch travel times and rapid depletion of profitable prey types. In these situations the tactics of feeding as either specialist or as a generalist can be inferior to a tactic which starts as a specialist and then expands the diet after some time in the patch. Furthermore, predators should not necessarily stay longer in a patch if interpatch travel time increases. Some experimental tests of these new predictions are proposed. © 1980.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a heuristic model illustrating some major problems in analyzing seasonal life histories of multigeneration insects. The concept of the critical interval is introduced and defined as the age classes that survive at the end of a period of population growth. These conclusions follow from the results: The optimal age for occupying a habitat depends upon the duration of the habitat as well as the life history of the insect. Two positions of the initial age distribution may give local maxima for fitness. The critical interval should often include the youngest age classes to maximize fitness while the optimal position of the initial age distribution may be at a much older age. In this case, conflicts arise between the positions of the critical interval at the end of one growing period and the initial age distribution at the start of the next. The length of the critical interval that maximizes fitness in a particular environment may be relatively small in which case mortality at the end of a growing period may be high and timing would appear to be poor even though fitness is maximized. In this model, optimum generation lengths exist which are not the shortest attainable. Finally, the length of time that a habitat remains suitable influences all of the above results and must be taken into account in analyzing the adaptedness of life history traits. © 1980, All rights reserved.},

(3) relates changes in rectangular population rates to changes in age-sex composition.

The standardization approach is then applied to data from Sweden 1973 and the United States 1963, and the results and their implications are discussed.

It is shown that the convergence to an equilibrium state occurs in the presence of a constant stream of migration with fixed age-sex structure and constant vital rates. The duration of convergence (i.e., the time required for convergence) is less when there is net immigration than when there is no migration but more when there is net emigration, provided the age-sex composition of net migrants contains nonnegative values at all ages for both sexes or at least, for the sex which is assumed to be dominant. If the age-sex composition of net migrants contains positive, negative, and/or zero values, the duration may be less than, or equal to, or greater than that in the case with no migration depending on the actual age-sex composition of the net migrants and the mignitude of the net migration rate. The instrinsic growth rate follows a trend which is opposite to that of the duration of convergence, except when the age-sex composition of net migrants contains zero values at all ages below the oldest age at which reproduction takes place. In the case of this exception, the intrinsic growth rate will remain the same as in the absence of migration provided the net migration rate is not greater than one which is true in demographic applications. © 1979.},

Simple analytical expressions, derived for both discrete and continuous models, show that the increase in fecundity required to duplicate the effect of a unit shift in development is directly proportional to population growth rate and inversely proportional to survival rates. Our analysis requires no assumptions about the form of the maternity or survivorship functions. While these results agree well with the widely held notion that "r-selection" favors fast development time, they generate the somewhat paradoxical prediction that "K-selection" should favor high reproductive output. The resolution of this problem probably involves constraints not included in most current analyses. © 1980.},

(3)) or as the long-run rate of growth of the ensemble average of total population size (Eq. (4)). On the other hand, the Malthusian parameter of the expectation of a sequence of Leslie matrices is exactly the logarithm of the finite growth rate of the ensemble average of total population size when Leslie matrices are independently and identically distributed (though not in general when Leslie matrices are sequentially dependent).

The fecundity of adult individuals is assumed to be inversely proportional to egg size, and the mortality of planktonic larvae is assumed to be density independent and size dependent. The growth of planktonic larvae is assumed to be sigmoid with metamorphosis occurring at a given size. The model concludes that there are at most two evolutionarily stable egg sizes. Depending on larval growth rate and death rate, the metamorphosis size, a smaller egg size, or both may be evolutionarily stable. The predictions of the model are compared to patterns observed in nature. Illustrative data are supplied mainly from prosobranch molluscs. © 1979.},

	abstract = {A model is presented that specifies optimal switching times for the induction of diapause relative to the onset of winter in a deterministic environment. Fitness is defined as an individual's contribution to the overwintering population in diapause at the time of the first hard frost. The fitness of a nondiapausing female is determined by the switching times of her offspring. If age-specific fecundity and survivorship do not change significantly from generation to generation, the optimal switching time precedes the onset of winter by a constant amount of time equal to the age of first reproduction plus the time to produce one offspring plus the difference in ages between the sensitive age and the diapause age. This result is independent of the time at which the original female began to reproduce. However, if fecundity or survivorship decreases toward the end of the season, the optimal switching time depends upon the time when she began to reproduce and should be more conservative by an amount of time that can be computed. Possible tests of the model are proposed. © 1980, All rights reserved.},

We have constructed a phylogenetic tree of the catostomids based primarily on morphological data, and have estimated the divergence times from the fossil record and genetic distances. The losses of duplicate gene expression were then analyzed conditionally given this tree. Three probabilistic models were generated to describe the process of loss of gene expression: gene dysfunction depends on (1) time alone, (2) the number of speciation events alone, or (3) a combination of speciation and time. A maximum likelihood analysis revealed that the two component model fits the data better than the other models. The loss of duplicate gene expression is mediated by null mutations at structural and/or regulatory genes, and the rate of fixation of these nulls might have been enhanced by any reductions in population size accompanying speciation events. This reduction may explain the lower number of duplicate genes expressed in the more speciose taxa. © 1979.},

In this paper we study simple deterministic models, where the oscillations arise either solely from periodically varying contact rates or from the combined effect of large initial perturbation, small periodic variation of the contact rate, and the destabilizing nature of infectious and latent periods when described as time delays. The main results are: (a) For a model with a periodically varying contact rate and a recovery rate, a threshold amplitude of variation is found by numerical and analytic methods at which 2-year subharmonic resonance appears. (b) Approximate analytic relationships are derived for the amplitude and phase of the forced 1-year oscillations below this threshold and for the 2-year oscillations above it—in terms of the reproduction rate of the infection. (c) Similar calculations are performed when the recovery rate is replaced by a fixed infectious period represented by a pure time delay. The threshold amplitude of variation in the contact rate is found here to be smaller than in the recovery rate model. (d) A model with a fixed infectious period and a constant contact rate is considered. The nontrivial steady state is shown to be locally stable for the parameter range of interest. However, the ratio of the imaginary to real parts of the eigenvalues in the characteristic equation is increased as compared to the corresponding model with a recovery rate. (e) For the model with a fixed infectious period and a constant contact rate an approximation method indicates consistency in a certain range of contact rates with the existence of an unstable periodic solution about the locally stable steady state. The actual existence of such a solution is not verified. The interpretation is that the destabilizing effect of the introduction of a pure delay into the model becomes more significant as the distance in the variables space from the endemic steady state is increased. (f) For a fixed infectious period and very small subthreshold variation in the contact rate, two different types of solutions are found numerically: yearly small-amplitude oscillations about an endemic average and large-amplitude oscillations of a subharmonic period. The pattern seen depends on the initial conditions. For a sufficiently large initial deviation from the endemic level even very small seasonal variations lead to regular recurrent outbreaks of the disease. The effect of latent periods and of changing the form of the interaction are also considered. © 1980, All rights reserved.},

A formula is derived for the expected homozygosity in the transient and stationary models, which is applied to general stepwise mutation models where mutation over more than one step is possible. The probability that two randomly chosen genes are j steps apart at time t in the stepwise mutation model is found to have a reasonably simple form if conditioning is on the initial allele frequencies arranged in order of magnitude. Of interest is a new geometric charge state model, mutation over several steps roughly corresponding to independent charge changes. The expected homozygosity and expected distance between two randomly chosen genes is tabulated in this model. © 1980.},

The main thesis is that individuals contract debilitating conditions now with the same force that used to result in deaths in the past. The difference in the two situations is that in the latter period, a certain proportion of the population can recover and thus escape death. Based on these assumptions, the relationships between the initial and the resulting life table functions have been developed in this paper. Among other things, the relative gain in life expectancy has been found to be inversely related to its initial value. Further, interesting results are obtained when a fixed proportion of the population can manage to survive a debilitating condition only once, only twice and so on. The limiting situation has been found to be equivalent to one in which the initial forces of mortality at all ages are reduced by a constant proportion. © 1979.},

Once obtained, these rules are contrasted with their earlier analogues. The major findings are that (1) prey types are not necessarily added to the optimal diet in order of decreasing energy to handling time ratio, and (2) the abundance of a type initially excluded from the diet is not necessarily irrelevant in determining whether or not that type will be included in the future. These findings show that, in the more general case considered, the structure of the optimal diet may be quite different than predicted by current theory. © 1979.},

When the preference rate for the heterozygote exceeds that for homozygotes, it is established that the unique stable state is the central Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The rate of approach is faster with sexual selection than for the corresponding model of assortative mating. When the preference rates favor the homozygotes then in this symmetric model of sexual selection two asymmetric Hardy-Weinberg polymorphisms can evolve, and which succeeds depends on initial conditions. The models are also analyzed with natural selection acting on phenotypes superimposed on assortative mating. In this case we can have up to three coexisting stable states involving both fixation alternatives and a central polymorphism. The corresponding model with sexual selection maintains either the central equilibrium as in assortative mating or two asymmetric polymorphic equilibria. © 1978.},

	abstract = {At any given moment in time a plant is partitioning total growth mass into its various component parts such as leaves, roots, reproductive material, etc. The view is taken that the plant has evolved a life history strategy to control this partitioning process. This paper illustrates the utility of optimal control theory for use in determining life history strategies which maximize fitness for a given asexual plant model. The optimal control methods are first used on a model previously analyzed by Professor Dan Cohen, who used a different method. His results of a change from 100% vegetable growth to 100% reproductive growth at a fixed switching time is again obtained. This 100% switching result is shown to be more generally applicable by using a qualitatively described model. However the switching time in general is shown to be a function of both leaf mass and time remaining to the end of the growing season. The allocation to toxin production is also considered. It is shown that under this model an inequality between system parameters must be satisfied before the plant should allocate growth to toxin production. Although the particular model explored here may rarely be realistic in nature, these same methods of optimal control theory can be applied in a similar fashion to many other proposed models of plant resource allocation. © 1980.},

	abstract = {This review encompasses a decade of studies of enzyme polymorphism in plant populations, in the light of both general theory and specific, simplified models. The patterns of the observed frequency of heterozygotes, compared with panmictic expectations adjusted only for inbreeding, are summarised for 23 outbreeding and 7 inbreeding plant species. There is a trend for outbreeders to show less heterozygosity than expected, and inbreeders to show more, despite the contrary evolutionary pressures on the mating system (the so-called heterozygosity paradox). An annual life cycle and pollination by animal vectors seem to increase the discrepancy in outbreeders. Of the several forces which might account for this paradox, the effects of intense microgeographic differentiation, of low gene flow, of self compatibility and of overdominance of linked segments are predominant. The evidence indicates that inbreeding plant species show more intense geographic and microgeographic differentiation, and more intense multilocus associations than outbreeders. Recent attempts to describe selection operating on variants by the analysis of life cycle components, of physiological processes, and of genetic demography are discussed. The fundamental importance of mating systems and their variation, as a distinctive feature of plant populations is already clear from the studies in hand. Therefore a closer integration of the joint microevolution of mating systems, and of genetic variation is required in both theoretical and experimental studies. © 1979.},

The parameters of these two formulations are explicitly related; the new model is easier to work with, but yields the same results as the original. The model is then extended to the case where multiple alternate substrates may be growth limiting, using the corresponding kinetic analogs for multiple-substrate enzymes. Again, one is led to a Lotka-Volterra analog. In the multiple-substrate model, however, coexistence of multiple genotypes is possible, in contrast to the single-substrate model. The usual Lotka-Volterra conditions for existence and stability of pure or mixed equilibria may all be translated into corresponding statements about the parameters of the chemostat system. Possible extensions to deal with metabolic inhibition, cross-feeding, and predation are indicated. © 1980.},

	abstract = {Various tests of the hypothesis of selective neutrality based on gene frequency are now available. These tests take as null hypothesis the concept of "strict neutrality": all new mutants are required to be selectively identical to each other. For evolutionary questions, however, (as opposed to those of genetic polymorphism), a wider null hypothesis might be of interest. Since deleterious alleles have essentially no evolutionary importance, one might wish to test the null hypothesis that only neutral or deleterious mutations occur. The principal alternative to this hypothesis is that there exists heterotic selection of some form for some alleles tending to maintain a level of genetic polymorphism higher than that under neutrality. In this paper an assessment is made of the usefulness of a test of strict neutrality first proposed by this author (Ewens, 1972) as a test of null hypothesis of "generalized neutrality," i.e. that only neutral or deleterious alleles occur. At the same time some remarks will be made about estimation of the fundamental parameter θ defining these processes. © 1979.},

	abstract = {Several new models are proposed for the evolution of haplodiploidy. Each of these models is evaluated for its ability to explain (1) special problems associated with transition to haplodiploidy from a population of diplodiploid progenitors, (2) current patterns of population structure in haplodiploid and related species, and (3) the evolution of genetic systems similar but not identical to haplodiploid systems. Of the new models, three are based on special conditions associated with inbreeding. Close inbreeding provides for the automatic effects of reduced problems in expressing recessives, lowered differences in gain from heterozygosity (to produce both heterotic effects and a greater variety of offspring) between haploid and diploid males, effective protection of haploids from direct competition with diploids, and a mechanism for the spread of haplodiploidy through gains derived from increased ability to control sex ratio. These models differ in the context where gain from sex ratio control is expressed. Pathways for the evolution of haplodiploidy in outbreeding populations are also discussed. Females who parthenogenetically produce haploid males have high genetic relatedness to their sons. If the sperm of these males is used to make both sons and daughters, i.e., through matings with diplodiploid females, there may be a net gain for haplodiploids. Another outbreeding model, modified from S. W. Brown (1964, Genetics 49, 797-817), deals with selection for females producing haploid males in populations where there are driving sex chromosomes. Biases created by drive in sex ratio may allow haplodiploid females to be the only effective producers of males in the population. Several of the new models explain the whole range of haplodiploid and related adaptations and provide predictions that appear to be more consistent with the known structure of contemporary populations than those available in current models. © 1980.},

	abstract = {In an attempt to understand the foraging of a generalist herbivore, a linear programming optimization model was constructed to describe moose feeding in summer. The model attempts to predict the amounts of aquatic vegetation, deciduous leaves, and forbs a moose should consume each day; and to determine whether or not its feeding is constrained by the maximum feeding time available each day, its daily rumen processing capacity, its sodium requirements, and its energy metabolism. The model can be solved for two alternative strategies: time minimization and energy maximization. The energy-maximizing strategy appears to predict the observed diet chosen by an average moose very well. Also, the diets selected by moose of each sex and various reproductive states appear to fit the energy-maximizing strategy. In addition, it is demonstrated that a moose's body size at weaning, size at first reproduction, and maximum size are related to foraging efficiency. Furthermore, there appears to exist an optimum adult body size for feeding. The general conclusion arrived at is that the foraging of a generalist herbivore can be predicted in a quantitative manner, at least in this case, as has been shown for other types of consumers (carnivores and granivores). © 1978.},

An accounting of the nature of the equilibrium configurations in the Levene population subdivision model was done with respect to the above classes of selection regimes. In particular, it is established that multiple polymorphic equilibria do not arise for selection structures (i) and (ii), while for the mixed underdominant-overdominant selection form (iv) with appropriate parameter ranges there can exist two stable internal equilibria. A surprising finding is that the number and/or character of the equilibria is not changed by increased population division beyond that of two habitats, while there is a significant difference in the equilibrium possibilities for a one- as against a two-deme population. These results appear to be a special limiting feature of the Levene population subdivision formulation. © 1977.},

	abstract = {A quantitative study of the operation of Muller's Ratchet for the accumulation of deleterious genes in an asexually reproducing population is made. For a population of size N, in which deleterious mutations occur at rate λ/genome/ generation, and the relative fitness of an individual with k mutants is (1 - s)k, the most important parameter is n0 = Ne-θ, where θ = λ s. If n0 is large (≥25), deleterious mutations will accumulate very slowly, and independently of each other; if n0 is small (<1), the rate of accumulation of deleterious mutations will be greater than a natural population could plausibly bear; an estimate of the speed of the Ratchet for intermediate values of n0 is made. It is pointed out that the frequency distribution for the numbers of individuals carrying k mutants will retain its shape, but will move bodily to the right at the same average speed as the Ratchet. When favourable mutations also occur, the frequency distributions can move right of left; an estimate of the probability that any particular step is right or left is made, and it is shown that, for a given net rate of arrisal of deleterious mutations, the greater the rate of beneficial mutation, the greater the chance that beneficial mutations will accumulate. © 1978.},

	abstract = {The dynamics of chromosomal segments under selection are investigated by comparing experimental data to simulations of simple models of selection. The simulations assume 93 loci distributed evenly along an entire chromosome. The two issues addressed in this paper concern rates of decay of linkage disequilibria for chromosomes under selection and rates of gene frequency change after perturbation of gametic frequencies to states near the edge of the gametic frequency simplex. The findings are: (1) If reasonable values of inbreeding depression are assumed, linkage disequilibria decays to zero but at a rate nearly twice that expected from neutral theory. Experimental results also show accelerated decay rates. The acceleration of decay seems to be a simple consequence of the increased heterozygosity produced by selection. It is, therefore, argued that massive linkage disequilibria, of the kind found by Franklin and Lewontin (1970) in their simulations, are unlikely to characterize the genetic structure of natural populations of random mating organisms. (2) It is possible to distinguish between two time-honored models of multilocus selection, known as the symmetric overdominant and classical models, on the basis of gene frequency change near the edge of the gametic frequency simplex assuming linkage disequilibria is intense. (3) Examination of experimental data from perturbation experiments shows that neither of these elementary models adequately account for observed rates of gene frequency change, although the symmetric overdominant model does provide the better fit. Instead the experimental data suggest a markedly nonuniform distribution of selective effects along the chromosome. The data also suggest that these selective effects combine in markedly nonadditive ways in determining joint fitness. © 1978.},

This form of growth is derived from life history considerations so that the impact of the release of sterile males on immatures and on adults can be compared. When the migration parameter and the sterile male release parameter are small, the system has three internal equilibriums (the middle one being unstable). Increase in immigration or in release results in one stable equilibrium. The practical conclusion is that migration must be very small in order for the release of sterile males to be effective on suppressing numbers of adults, while more migration can be tolerated if, as in many agricultural pests, immature stages are the object of concern. © 1978.},

Natural selection, in some form, may often be the major determinant of genetic population structure and differentiation.

For competition on the same resource, but with each species monopolizing an exclusive resource as well: 1) Purely exploitative competition always leads to a unique point coexistence. 2) If interference is added to the system described in (1), two points of coexistence, separated by a saddle (an "unstable equilibrium") are possible.

	abstract = {As the first step in developing an optimal foraging model for moose (Belovsky 1978), a time-energy budget for a moose was developed. For the summer period (late May through early September) at Isle Royale National Park, Michigan, we made various behavioral observations on feeding moose and inventoried their food resources. Employing these various sets of data, we were able to determine the quantity of each food consumed by moose, the time required to acquire the foods, preferences for different food plants, and differences demonstrated by the sexes. In addition to this information, we collected data on the moose's ability to utilize each of the forage plants and the population densities of moose in different years (1972-1974) in two forest types. This enabled us to examine energy flow within each of the populations and determine in what manner energy limits the moose population. © 1978.},

	abstract = {It is argued that alternate prey species in the diet of a food-limited generalist predator should reduce each other's equilibrial abundances, whether or not they directly compete. Such indirect, interspecific interactions are labeled apparent competition. Two examples are discussed in which an observed pattern of habitat segregation was at first interpreted as evidence for direct competition, but later interpreted as apparent competition resulting from shared predation. In order to study the consequences of predator-mediated apparent competition in isolation from other complicating factors, a model community is analyzed in which there is no direct interspecific competition among the prey. An explicit necessary condition for prey species coexistence is derived for the case of one predator feeding on many prey species. This model community has several interesting properties: (1) Prey species with high relative values for a parameter r a are "keystone" species in the community; (2) prey species can be excluded from the community by "diffuse" apparent competition; (3) large changes in the niche breadth of the predator need not correspond to large changes in predator density; (4) the prey trophic level as a whole is regulated by the predator, yet each of its constituent species is regulated by both the predator and available resources; (5) increased productivity may either increase, decrease, or leave unchanged the number of species in the community; (6) a decrease in density-independent mortality may decrease species diversity. These conclusions seem to be robust to changes in the prey growth equations and to the incorporation of predator satiation. By contrast, adding prey refugia or predator switching to the model weakens these conclusions. If the predator can be satiated or switched, the elements aij comprising the community matrix may have signs opposite the long-term effect of j upon i. The effect of natural selection upon prey species coexistence is discussed. Unless ri, Ki, and ai are tightly coupled, natural selection within prey species i will tend to decrease the equilibrial abundance of species j. © 1977.},

It is shown that the allocation of search has been optimal if and only if the "marginal cost" of additional food is equal throughout the foraging area when the period has elapsed. The model is used to predict the optimal area radius and allocation of search time. With realistic parameter values, the optimal time per unit area roughly decreases linearly with the distance from the central place.

It is shown by example that May's qualitative stability criterion does not ensure stability in any sense unless restrictive conditions on the form of the model are satisfied. Even under these conditions, the criterion, which is based on linearization, generally provides information only about the local dynamics of multispecies models. The applicability of such information to stochastic limiting similarity theory is discussed and alternative methods of analysis are proposed. © 1978.},

Two classes of models of partial assortative mating mediated by a multiallele trait are studied. The first involves two phenotypic assorting classes determined by the level of heterozygosity, and the second assorting grouping specifies each genotype as a separate phenotype. It is established that increased allelism facilitates the existence and stability nature of central polymorphic states, although the rate of approach is diminished. The nature of the equilibrium realizations is determined by a balance in the intensity differential between homozygote and heterozygote assorting rates against the relative viability forces acting between the phenotype classes. As in the case of two alleles there is possible simultaneous stability of fixation outcomes and a central polymorphism. Increased allelism allows more scope for these more complex multiple stability contingencies. © 1978.},

The maximum effect is when the migration rate is very small (e.g., one migrant gene every two or three generations). A maximum value of the heterozygosity at a small value of the migration rate also occurs when there is heterozygote disadvantage in each of the two colonies. © 1978.},

The model is based on a stochastic analysis of an insect's mortality, development, and reproduction response to temperature. The key concept in the model is the utilization of a physiological time scale. Different temperatures affect the population by increasing an individual's physiological age by differing rates. Conditions for the temperature response properties are given which establish the validity of the model for variable temperature regimes. These conditions refer to the relationship between chronological and physiological age. Reasonable agreement between the model and field populations demonstrates the practicality of this approach. © 1978.},

We show that polymorphism is likely with the combination of several niches and several seasons.

It is a stepping stone model with differential migration of genotypes. It is applied to the polymorphism of the indoor and the outdoor genotypes of the yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti. Matrix methods and simple models of population genetics comprised the computer model. Polymorphism is likely with most reasonable values of the parameters. Fitnesses and rate of movement are the most important parameters influencing the character and likelihood of polymorphism; habitat selection and positive assortative mating have much less effect. The model indicates that polymorphism of A. aegypti in east Africa results from: (1) the presence of a dry season when breeding occurs only in the human habitat; (2) greater fitness of the indoor ecotype in the human habitat and of the outdoor ecotype in the natural habitat; and (3) less than random movement between human and natural habitats. © 1977.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates the use of heuristically derived stochastic differential equations (SDEs) as models in population biology. It is stressed that these equations are best viewed as approximations for more realistic, but often analytically intractable, models. A criterion is presented for determining which interpretation (e.g., Ito or Stratonovich) is likely to serve as the most useful approximation. Several limit theorems are presented which illustrate the use and implications of this criterion. In particular, it is shown that the solutions to sequences of models which approach a given SDE may converge to a diffusion process which corresponds to no solution of the SDE. However, arguing that in population biology the SDEs are generally serving as approximations to stochastic difference equations with autocorrelated noise, it is shown for a variety of models that the Ito calculus may provide a more useful approximation than the Stratonovich. Important limitations of this result and on the use of SDEs are indicated. These findings and observations are compared with those of several papers in the recent literature. © 1977.},

We demonstrate here that such projections based solely on time-invariant, age-specific male fertilities and mortalities are incompatible with those based solely on female fertilities and mortalities. This incompatibility obtains even in the singular case where effective male and female fertility functions are equal, and generate equal ultimate rates of growth. In standard demographic practice, the incompatibility is initially masked, since one-sex fertility functions are generally calculated from the same initial-time data and thereby tautologically forced to initially concur; however, with the passage of any finite time, the incompatibility reasserts itself-the only exception being the uninteresting case where the system is already in the stationary age and sex distribution of balanced exponential growth. An example is adduced of a nonlinear (age-free) system whose true rate of ultimate growth is correctly bracketed by the male and female one-sex rates of ultimate growth. Analysis of more general two-sex models shows that the two one-sex growth rates, calculated for arbitrary male and female initial age distributions, need not bracket the true rate. We show, however, that models exist such that with appropriate choices of initial conditions, this bracketing will occur. © 1977.},

This always causes switching in the model, and changes a functional response from one that imposes a risk on the average prey that decreases with prey density in the direction of one that imposes an increasing risk. I discuss the conditions for a response that is density dependent, and those predatory attributes that make such a response more likely. Transit time between subhabitats always increases the density dependent effect, and is necessary for "system stability" in a Lotka-Volterra model with two prey species. Experiments have confirmed the model's basic assumption. General predators do not fit easily into classical predator-prey models of simple "closed" communities, and then the degree of density dependence of the functional response becomes a useful measure of a predator's short-term stabilizing effect on a prey species. The model demonstrates how spatial heterogeneity can be stabilizing. © 1977.},

We first develop a model of environmental heterogeneity in which there are two discrete environmental states. Transitions between states are governed by a stochastic matrix. Next, we examine how an organism responds to this heterogeneity. We assume that L consecutive time units of the environmental process are sampled during the normal life span of the organism, and that the individual's fitness is determined in part by a component unrelated to this heterogeneity and by other components that describe the fitness response to the heterogeneity. The fitness responses are functions of the environmental state and of how long the organism has been previously exposed to that state; i.e., fitness response is dependent upon the environmental context. We then discuss how this individually experienced heterogeneity is translated to the populational level. Finally, genetic constraints are overlaid so that the tools of population genetics may be used to make evolutionary predictions. © 1978.},

	abstract = {A non-Markovian epidemic model is proposed for which a stochastic epidemic threshold theorem, like that by Whittle (1955) for a simpler model, is shown to hold. The threshold theorem can be a useful guide in determining public health measures aimed at preventing major outbreaks of a communicable disease. Bounds are obtained for the mean size of minor epidemics. A parameter of the model, whose value is crucial to applications of these results, is the product of the infection rate and the mean duration of the infectious period. Estimators are suggested for this parameter by identifying martingales associated with counting processes of the epidemic model and by constructing other martingales which can be written as stochastic integrals. © 1977.},

Confidence limits on this proportion depend on the number of loci controlling the trait under investigation and the linkage relationships among the loci. Such information is generally not available. If it is assumed that the number of loci is large, the variance of the proportion of homozygous loci is approximated by the variance of the total map length which is homozygous by descent; this is calculated for several regular mating systems, including selfing, sib mating, and parent-off-spring mating. In particular, the confidence interval on the proportion of homozygous loci in Drosophila is likely to be large, and this has a number of implications to the interpretation and analysis of experimental data. © 1977.},

Assuming a subdivided population at carrying capacity, the model describes selection at a biallelic locus (A, a) where a is opposed by Mendelian selection but is favored by a lower rate of extinction of demes having high a frequency. By contrast to the linear diffusion equations encountered in classical mathematical genetics, the PDE governing the dynamics is now nonlinear in the metapopulation gene frequency distribution φ(x, t); furthermore, the initial conditions now heavily influence the equilibrium distribution φ∞(x). A fully explicit formula (20) expressing this dependence is derived. The results indicate that a fixation is never reached, but (A, a) polymorphism in the metapopulation will result if E(0) - E(1) s > B(1 - h), where s ≪ 1 parametrizes the strength of Mendelian selection, E(x) is the Levins extinction operator, h (typically in the open interval (0, 1)) is the dominance of a, and B is a parameter measuring the flatness of the initial distribution f(x) in the x → 1 limit. © 1978.},

The adequacy of this procedure must depend upon the evolutionary history.

	abstract = {A series of theoretical models of positive assortative mating and sexual selection are contrasted. It is established that for a dominant trait partial positive assortative mating generally implies some fixation, whereas sexual selection exhibits a unique globally stable polymorphism exhibiting Hardy-Weinberg proportions. The effects of monogamy against polygamy do not qualitatively alter the equilibrium outcomes, although the rate of evolutionary change is generally slowed with monogamy vis-à-vis polygamy. For sexual selection the influence of timing of random mating as against preferential mating causes no change in the equilibrium states, although the rates of convergence can be slowed if sexual selection occurs late in the breeding season. Under assortative mating the timing can alter the equilibrium outcomes. The amount of heterozygosity is always deficient in cases of assortative mating, but always exhibits Hardy-Weinberg ratios under a sexual selection mechanism. This suggests that observations consistent with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium states cannot preclude ipso facto certain forms of selection forces, including mating patterns and some natural selection structures. © 1978.},

The factors are determined from the matrices of conditional probabilities which describe the genotypes of relatives. Since selection occurs, these probabilities are in terms of genotype frequencies. The relationship between the risk to helper and benefit to recipient which allows altruism to evolve is shown to depend on the kinship coefficient between helper and helped, the particular fitness function proposed and the degree of dominance of the altruism.

	abstract = {A model of mate selection is described in which females mate preferentially according to their probability of encounter with the males they prefer. In this model, different thresholds of response to the courtship of different male phenotypes determine the female mating preferences. Females with a lower threshold toward particular males require fewer encounters before mating with these males and more encounters before mating with any of the others. Such females mate preferentially if they encounter a male they prefer before they have been stimulated to the level of the higher threshold. At the higher threshold they mate at random. The number of the extra encounters required to raise the females' level of stimulation from the lower to the higher threshold is a parameter of the model. The frequency of the preferred males then determines the probability that a female encounters and mates with one of them before she has been sufficiently stimulated to mate at random. Sexual selection by differences in male courtship can also be described in terms of this model. The preferred characters may be determined either by dominant and recessive alleles or by each different genotype. When only one extra encounter is required before the females mate at random, the preferred males only gain a slight frequency-dependent advantage: Stable polymorphisms can only be maintained if the heterozygotes have the greater preference in their favor. When more than one extra encounter is required before random mating, the males gain a negative frequency-dependent advantage: Stable polymorphisms are generally maintained. The models are fitted to published data on the mating success of male Drosophila at varying frequencies and provide an explanation of the "rare male" effect in which less common males gain a mating advantage. © 1978.},

Population function and regulation, and community self-maintenance and response to environmental fluctuation, can be approached in terms of the flow of reproducing populations through the mosaic. (2) Most communities are subject to disturbance followed by succession. Communities are diverse in the kinds and frequencies of disturbances and in kinds of successions and climaxes; and the species of a biota diversify in their relationships to successional time and patterns of successional and climax communities. (3) Although mosaic phenomena are general, two broad groupings may be recognized: intracommunity patterns that relate to microsite differentiation and species response to this, and intercommunity successional mosaics and climax complexes for which community disturbance is a major determining force. Relationships between elements of a mosaic can often be formulated in terms of a chain or network of replacement rates, but formulations should allow for the influence of bath terms and occurrence of semipermanent plateau stages in some successions. © 1977.},

Computer simulation has shown that the approximate formulas give a fairly accurate result unless the initial frequency of one of the alleles involved is close to 1 and t 2N is large, where N is the effective size of a subpopulation and t is the number of generations. It is shown that when the number of subpopulations (s) is small, the mean of FSTor GST depends on the initial gene frequencies as well as on s. When the initial frequencies of all alleles are nearly equal to each other and the number of subpopulations is large, the distribution of FST in the early generations is bell-shaped. In this case Lewontin and Krakauer's k parameter is approximately 2 or less. However, if one of the initial allele frequencies is close to 1, the distribution is skewed and leptokurtic, and the k parameter often becomes larger than 2 in later generations. Thus, even under pure random genetic drift, Lewontin and Krakauer's test of selective neutrality of polymorphic genes in terms of FST is not always valid. It is also shown that Jacquard's approximate formula for k generally gives an overestimate. © 1977.},

Because the actual measurement of physiological variables omits many variables relevant to survival, we are forced to view this model as operating in a stochastic state space for a population of individuals where only the frequency distributions are deterministic. In this stochastic state space, under the assumption that the "history" of prior movement contains no additional information, the forward partial differential equation is obtained for the distribution of a population whose movement in the selected space is determined by the randomwalk equations. If the initial distribution of the population in the state space is normal, then certain assumptions about movement and mortality will operate to preserve normality thereafter. Under the assumption of normality, simultaneous ordinary differential equations can be derived from the forward partial differential equation defining the distribution function. Examination of the ordinary simultaneous differential equations shows how parameters for certain models of aging and mortality can be obtained. © 1977.},

	abstract = {In demography, weak ergodicity is usually taken to mean the tendency of an age distribution to "forget" its past, or, equivalently, the essential dependence of current age distribution on only a recent history of age-specific vital rates. We have been interested in providing a more complete mathematical description of the processes underlying weak ergodicity, and decided to begin our inquiry with an experimental approach. Our initial work has been with the discrete formulation of population dynamics, using 10 × 10 matrices for closed populations of human females as experimental data. The findings of our initial experiments are that a sequence of products of human population projection matrices converges towards the sequence defined by its positive, or Perron-Frobenius, eigenstructure, and that, when appropriately defined, sequences both of left and of right eigenvectors converge to constant vectors: left eigenvector sequences converge "forward" from a fixed point in time, while right eigenvector sequences converge "backward" from a given time point. In practice, this means that proportional age structure can be determined from a knowledge only of recent or "late" vital rates, while the relative contribution of initial age structure to eventual population size can be determined with a knowledge of only "early" vital rates in the sequence. For 10 × 10 human population projection matrices, products of 30 or more matrices appear always to contain closely convergent sequences of right and left eigenvectors, and adequate approximations to limiting values usually can be made using about 20 matrices for each limiting eigenvector. Because convergence is not monotone, and because patterns of convergence are specific to the structure of each product, it appears that stronger results will require strong conditions on the sequence of matrices in the product. © 1976.},

The mean and variance of FST in this process are studied by using the recurrence formulas for the moments of gene frequencies in the island model of finite size as well as by using Monte Carlo simulation. The mean and variance in the early generations can be predicted by the approximate formulas developed. On the other hand, if we exclude the cases of an allele being fixed in all subpopulations, the mean of FST eventually reaches a steady-state value. This value is given by 1 - 2NT(1 - λ) approximately, where NT is the total population size and λ is the rate of decay of heterozygosity at steady state. It is shown that the mean and variance of FST depend on the initial gene frequency and when this is close to 0 or 1, Lewontin and Krakauer's test of the neutrality of polymorphic genes is not valid. © 1977.},

It is assumed in this paper that the number of individuals in a monoecious population, or the numbers of males and females in a dioecious population, are states in a finite irreducible Markov chain. In general it is impossible to obtain a single value of ne. In some cases where the computation of ne is possible, the results are as follows. When the population is monoecious, Ne is the reciprocal of the asymptotic average, over population sizes, of the probabilities that two gametes uniting to form an individual came from the same individual one generation earlier. In dioecious populations, Ne is the reciprocal of the long-run average of the probabilities that two homologous genes in separate individuals of one generation came from the same individual one generation earlier. Special cases are discussed. © 1974.},

	abstract = {This paper studies the effectiveness of a class of linear statistical estimators called autoregressive and autoregressive-moving averages equations for mimicking and predicting the abundance fluctuations of three species of Drosophila censused at a pine plantation near Bogota, Colombia. A short introductory justification for the use of linear estimators is given followed by a brief discussion of the theoretical basis of statistical prediction. The assumptions of the method, fitting techniques, and use of the equations in forecasting are discussed. The mimicking ability of the equations is tested by comparing monte carlo simulations employing the fitted models to the observed fluctuations of the three species. Of the autoregressive equations fitted to each species two are judged successful and one less than successful. Autoregressive-moving averages models were found to be significantly worse predictors than the simpler autoregressive equations for these three species. The parameter estimates given by the preliminary estimation techniques are compared with the statistically efficient least squares estimates. The estimates compare well for most of the autoregressive models, but the parameter estimates for the autoregressive-moving averages models were misleading. © 1976.},

	abstract = {May and MacArthur (1972) have demonstrated that where several species are in competition for a single resource the requirement of long term population stability sets an upper limit to the allowable similarity of competing species. Their model considers a community of N species competing on a one dimensional resource continuum e.g., food size. The limit beyond which coexistence is not possible occurs when the standard deviation w in food size which each species can accept is of about the same magnitude as the difference d in mean food size for species adjacent on the continuum. The contribution of the present paper is to investigate the behavior of this stability criterion when the assumption that all species have the same w and d is relaxed. On the one hand, the greater is the disparity in the widths for a given mean width, the more closely the species can pack together. On the other hand, the greater is the disparity in the spacings for a given mean spacing, the more widely apart the species must pack. The substance of the conclusions set forth by May and MacArthur stands firm when there is only a modest amount of variability in the widths and spacings. However, care should be taken when the variability is considerable. © 1976.},

For certain fitness combinations satisfying the above relationship and characterized by values of V and X much lower than one, iteration reveals the development of stable limit cycles of allele frequencies rather than convergence to an equilibrium point. Addition of a third allele, or overlap between generations, eliminates these cycles. Queen-level overdominance is sufficient but not necessary for balanced polymorphism when V < 1, is both sufficient and necessary when V = 1, and is necessary but not sufficient when V > 1. Colony-level selection is a potentially powerful force maintaining genetic variation in populations of social insects, but does not imply correspondence between queen and worker genotype frequencies. © 1976.},

	abstract = {A linear model for population dynamics in a stationary stochastic environment is introduced based on linearizing the N-species Lotka-Volterra competition equations in discrete time. Iteration of the linear model shows the sequence of population sizes to be formed from a simple linear operation on the sequence of carrying capacities. The transfer function for this operation is calculated and the spectral properties of time series data on population size follow directly. The above approach is illustrated with a symmetrical two-species competition system assuming white noise variation in the carrying capacities. The results are interpreted in detail with the following ideas. (1) The intrinsic rate of increase governs the "responsiveness" of the population to changes in the carrying capacity; (2) one effect of competition is to reduce the "effective rate of increase" of the population. Increasing competition can produce effects identical to that of lowering the intrinsic rate of increase; (3) the other effect of competition is to communicate the stochastic variation in one species' carrying capacity to its competitors. The end result of this communication depends critically on the cross-correlation scheme among the carrying capacities of the competing species. © 1975.},

An individual is always born in one state but can be converted to the other before reaching adulthood. If the conversion takes place by a learning process, the native state is called "unskilled," and that acquired by learning is called "skilled." If phenotypic conversion takes place by way of infection, the native state is uninfected, and can be converted to infected. Native and converted phenotypes may be subject to selection; acquiring a skill may lead to selective advantage of skilled versus unskilled, while contracting a disease may involve a selective disadvantage. Conversion probability is a function of the parental phenotypes. In some of our models we assume that only one parent has teaching ability (or transmits the disease) and in others we consider more general situations. The probability of learning (or of taking the disease) may be determined by the individual's genotype. A diallelic locus is considered. The evolution of the genotypes and the phenotypes is studied in a variety of situations. Equilibria, and in a few simple cases the dynamics of the phenotypes and genotypes in the population are given. The usual equilibrium for heterozygote advantage is found to depend, in the present case, on the parameters of the learning process. Oscillatory equilibria and more than one stable equilibrium can exist in certain circumstances. Even in the absence of genotypic differences for the conversion probability gene frequencies may change. © 1976.},

In that case there is one polymorphic equilibrium at which there is linkage disequilibrium. The equilibrium solutions in the general model of meiotic drive proposed by Prout, et al. are given in this paper together with a stability analysis. It is shown that up to three polymorphic equilibria may exist, two of which are in linkage disequilibrium and one in linkage equilibrium. These equilibria exhibit behavior qualitatively opposite to what is widely accepted as the usual for two locus systems and which is not seem in the simple case originally treated. The polymorphic equilibria with linkage disequilibrium may be stable for loose linkage and not for tight while that with linkage equilibrium is stable in an interval of relatively tight linkage values. © 1976.},

When this restriction is relaxed, it becomes possible to find situations in which n species can coexist on fewer than n resources. On the basis of this and other observations we conclude that the competitive exclusion principle should be considered to apply only to coexistence at fixed densities. © 1976.},

	abstract = {A reasonably general theory for predicting the outcome of coevolution among interacting species is developed. It is applied to a model for resource partitioning among competing species. Current theory for resource partitioning is based on derivations of a "limiting similarity"-i.e., a limit to how similar competitors can be to one another consistent with coexistence. This theory presumes there is a mechanism, perhaps invasion and extinction, which causes competitors to attain the limiting similarity. The view taken in this paper is that partitioning is an evolutionary compromise between pressures for character displacement and disadvantages inherent in the shift to different resource types. A set of principles is offered for the evolution of the parameters in ecological models. (1) For single population models natural selection causes the parameters ultimately to assume those values which produce the highest equilibrium population size. (2) For models of interacting populations, but without interspecific frequency-dependence, natural selection causes the parameters to assume values which produce either the highest or lowest equilibrium population size for any species depending on the sign of the "feedback" in the community obtained by deleting that species. (3) For models of interacting populations with interspecific frequency dependence natural selection leads to parameter values which produce intermediate equilibrium population sizes. A function called the conditional equilibrium population size is introduced. Provided (a) the mean fitness is a maximum in each species at a stable coevolutionary equilibrium and (b) there is negative density-dependence in each species then natural selection causes the parameters to assume values which produce the highest conditional equilibrium population size for each species. These coevolutionary principles, applied to a model for resource partitioning, entail that the niche separation between species relative to given niche widths, increases with the variety of available resources and decreases with the number of competing populations. Also, the evolution of character displacement between two species does not proceed far enough to maximize the equilibrium population sizes of the species involved. These results imply that the relationship between the niche overlap (of nearest neighbors) and species diversity is qualitatively different depending on whether the variety of resources at any place covaries with the species diversity there. Without covariation niche overlap increases with species diversity; with covariation overlap may decrease with species diversity. This study provides the beginning of a theory for the convergent evolution of community structure. © 1976.},

The effect of violating the stability conditions on the behaviour of the model was investigated by computer simulation. Two further types of behaviour are noted in which coexistence is possible. The first is a two point limit cycle in which young and old predators occur in alternate time periods. The second involves a limit cycle in which the component population trajectories lie on closed curves in phase space. © 1976.},

We suppose that the trait is determined by a pair of alleles and concentrate on the autosomal case with complete dominance. We are interested in the case when the mating preferences are determined by the phenotype of relatives, such as parents or sibs. This is a possible consequence of imprinting, a kind of learning process which occurs early after birth in warmblooded vertebrates. In spite of the greater analytical complexity of these models, their results are very similar to those found when the preference is determined by the phenotype of the mating individual itself. In particular the preference for the same phenotype as that of relatives usually leads to the fixation of either morph, depending on the initial frequency. Polymorphism, on the other hand, always results when the preference is for a phenotype which differs from that of relatives. © 1975.},

Interest in the model has recently increased because of its relevance to certain questions involving the rate of differentiation of sub-populations under the neutral allele hypothesis (e.g., Smith, 1970; Latter, 1973). It is perhaps the only realistic population structure in which the test for neutrality proposed by Lewontin and Krakauer (1973) is valid (Lewontin and Krakauer, 1975). If data from natural populations is to be compared to the predictions of the Island Model, it is desirable to have an alternative model with the same migration pattern but with natural selection operating. In this paper one such model will be introduced where the stochastic element comes from random fluctuations in the environment rather than from genetic drift. The model is a direct extension of the one in the previous paper in this series (Gillespie, 1975) which dealt with a population which is subdivided into two patches with restricted migration between them. © 1976.},

The model allows for frequency and time dependent birth and death rates. It is analyzed under the assumption that the selective forces acting in the population are small. Slow selection approximations to the system's solution are then constructed. Two particular cases are studied. First, when linkage between loci is tight, the population is shown to rapidly approach Hardy-Weinberg proportions, which then may vary on a (slow) time scale determined by differential fitness. In the case of constant birth and death rates, a measure of the population's fitness is shown to increase on the slow time scale after an initial rapid adjustment. The second case considered is for loose linkage; a population near linkage equilibrium is studied. It is shown that the epistatic parameters cancel and that the results agree with the tight linkage case to leading order. The linkage disequlibrium is described in both cases. © 1976.},

It thus anticipates that technical advances will soon provide data of this form in volume approaching that currently obtained from electrophoresis. The assumption made on the nature of the data will require us to use, in the terminology ofKimura (Theor. Pop. Biol. 2, 174-208 (1971)), the "infinite sites" model of Karlin and McGregor (Proc. Fifth Berkeley Symp. Math. Statist. Prob. 4, 415-438 (1967)) rather that the "infinite alleles" model of Kimura and Crow (Genetics 49, 174-738 (1964)). We emphasize that these two models refer not to two different real-world circumstances, but rather to two different assumptions concerning our capacity to investigate the real world. We compare our results where appropriate with corresponding sampling theory of Ewens (Theor. Pop. Biol. 3, 87-112 (1972)) for the "infinite alleles" model. Note finally that some of our results depend on an assumption of independence of behavior at individual sites; a parallel paper byWatterson (submitted for publication (1974)) assumes no recombination between sites. Real-world behavior will lie between these two assumptions, closer to the situation assumed by Watterson than in this note. Our analysis provides upper bounds for increased efficiency in using complete nucleotide sequences. © 1974.},

If a strain is available which is advantageous to man, the integrated genetical system may be used to replace rather than to control the target population. An explicit formula is derived for the immigration level which can be sustained by a strain of a given fertility. In comparing the sterile male technique with the use of cytoplasmically incompatible males for control it is concluded that the former is to be chosen since the release rates of males necessary for population suppression would cause population replacement due to the unavoidable escape of even a very few females. © 1976.},

	abstract = {The analysis presented in this paper is constructed to determine the pattern of resource allocations among competing individuals of the same and/or different species in some defined habitat. Competing individuals have at their disposal various activities which can be run at different intensities and consume or produce resources in the habitat linearly. The linearity of resource utilization restricts the analysis to exploitative competition. Each resource is assigned values representing the reproductive gain and reproductive cost to the organism incurred while utilizing the resource. The organisms attempt to choose the amounts and kinds of resources which maximize the total reproductive gain. Resource utilization is restricted by the availability of resources in the habitat, the patterns of consumption associated with the activities of the individuals, and the demand for the individual resources (fixed through competition pressure) of the habitat. It is proved that under these restrictions a competitive equilibrium exists where resources are utilized so as to maximize individual reproductive gain and that this equilibrium generates the most efficient utilization of the resources in that habitat. The selection of a diet subject to nutritional requirements is given as an example of possible applications of this approach. The assumptions and restrictions associated with this technique of analysis are discussed. © 1975.},

	abstract = {The ultimate rate of approach to equilibrium in the infinite stepping-stone model is calculated. The analysis is restricted to a single locus in the absence of selection, and every mutant is assumed to be new to the population. Let f(t, x) be the probability that two homologous genes separated by the vector x in generation t are the same allele. It is supposed that f(0, x) = O(x-2-η), η > 0, as x ≡ | x | → ∞. In the absence of mutation, f(t, x) tends to unity at the rate t -1 2 in one dimension and (ln t)-1 in two dimensions. Thus, the loss of genetic variability in two dimensions is so slow that evolutionary forces not considered in this model would supervene long before a two-dimensional natural population became completely homogeneous. If the mutation rate, u, is not zero f(t, x) asymptotically approaches equilibrium at the rate (1 - u)2tt -3 2 in one dimension and (1 - u)2tt-1(lnt)-2 in two dimensions. Integral formulas are presented for the spatial dependence of the deviation of f(t, x) from its stationary value as t → ∞, and for large separations this dependence is shown to be (const + x) in one dimension and (const + ln x) in two dimensions.

	abstract = {The way geneticists use the word "inbreeding" can be somewhat puzzling. How can the same word be applied to situations as different as the presence of commong ancestors in the pedigrees of two individuals, on one hand, and the attitude towards marriage in a population, on the other? How can the same parameter, i.e., the "inbreeding coefficient F," be used both, to measure the degree of genetic resemblance between individuals within a single population and also to measure the degree of genetic differences between groups of individuals. It will be useful for the sake of translation as well as for that of clarity, to delineate the various situations in which geneticists are led to refer to "inbreeding.". We shall see that this one word is used in, at least, five concepts: relationship between relatives; genetic drift; departure from panmixia of mating behaviour; subdivision of a population into several isolated groups; and divergence between the actual genotypic structure of a population and the reference "Hardy-Weinberg Structure.". © 1975.},

Male constancy and inconstancy, the proportions of male genes transmitted via pollen and ovules, are direct measure of maleness and femaleness.

The values obtained for twelve species show that gynodioecy is not a single breeding system, but merges into hermaphroditism and dioecy at opposite extremes. The distribution of inconstancies among individual males is described for six species. In most species, seed counts overestimate the ovule contributions of males. © 1976.},

	abstract = {A model of population structure is discussed which under certain circumstances allows for evolution of altruistic traits, beyond the classical restrictions imposed by kin selection theory and related concepts such as reciprocal altruism. Essentially, the model sees a large population as socially subdivided into small groups without any barriers, however, to free random mating. An altruistic trait is defined as lowering, locally, the fitness of a carrier below that of noncarriers within the same group; but the local fitness of an individual randomly chosen in a group increases with the number of altruists. It is shown that altruism can evolve even if the groups are randomly formed. The conditions for such evolution are contrasted with those prevailing when the groups are formed either with some phenotypic assortment between the members or on the basis of kinship. It is shown that any possibility of evolution tends to rapidly disappear as groups become large, unless there is complete positive assortment or individuals in the groups are kin. The example of alarm calls is also considered, and the two extremes of random and sib-groups are contrasted, using a model by Maynard Smith. It is shown that alarm calls can evolve in small groups of unrelated individuals under conditions qualitatively similar but quantitatively more rigorous than those prevailing for sib-groups. © 1976.},

We show that the expected time to absorption of an allele in a finite population is significantly retarded for all initial gene frequencies in the former model. The expected time to absorption of an allele in the latter model is retarded only at extreme initial gene frequencies; at intermediate initial gene frequencies the expected time to absorption is accelerated. We conclude that the criterion for polymorphism based on the geometric mean of the heterozygote being greater than that of both homozygotes provides only limited information about the fate of gene frequency. © 1975.},

These studies have all used the Lotka-Volterra model of competition, and have assumed that the competition coefficient αij may be calculated using the expression, αij = ∝ Ui(R) Uj(R) dR ∝ (Ui(R))2 dR. In this paper, the generality of this formula is questioned and two alternative expressions for αij are proposed. When these expressions are used in an analysis of limiting similarity, qualitatively different conclusions emerge regarding the existence and nature of this limit, using either deterministic or stochastic models. The relevance of these findings to theories of character convergence and similarity barriers is discussed. The available field evidence does not strongly support the validity of the formula for αij used in previous studies. Since a given method of calculating αij must be derived from a higher level model, it is suggested that the Lotka-Volterra model is not sufficient in an investigation of limiting similarity. © 1975.},

Close intrinsic resemblance between homozygous and heterozygous forms of a new mutant gene is shown to substantially increase the à priori survival probability of this gene. A probabilistic effect of selection is, thus, shown to statistically favor dominant or near dominant mutant genes to start with.

	abstract = {This study derives simple models of competition and applies them to the description and prediction of habitat shift. Habitat shift is a change from one species population to another in the habitats occupied by most of their individuals. Interference models in which individuals are limited in their time for feeding by other individuals can give rise to competition equations structurally identical to Lotka-Volterra models. These models have linear zero-isoclines. Interference models in which individuals as a group are energy-limited produce nonlinear, concave downward, zero-isoclines. These are asymptotic to the axes. Unlike the linear-isocline case, such models always produce a unique stable equilibrium. Asymptotes may be made nonzero by inclusion of a refugium into the isocline equation. Exploitation models in which individuals of different species feed with finegrained selection on the same resources but gain different energies from these give parallel linear isoclines. They cannot produce a stable point equilibrium, whether consumption per individual is fixed or not. A simple model, in which individuals have flexible requirements and feed with fine-grained selection, has a unique stable equilibrium if each species has some resources not usable by the other. This model has concave downward isoclines. If one species utilizes only resource kinds included within those of another, both can coexist if the first is sufficiently better at obtaining the shared resources and if there are enough such resources. Systems of equations specifying growth of both consumers and resources can sometimes give isoclines that are linear (MacArthur, R. H. 1968, The theory of the niche in "Population Biology and Evolution," Syracuse Univ. Press) or that are of the same curvilinear form as isoclines for the pure consumer systems. One way to relate competition to habitat shift is to assume the isocline equations hold separately for each of a set of habitats. Then if estimates of carrying capacities are available, models for isoclines can be constructed and competition parameters computed by regression techniques, using data for each habitat as a separate point. Relative carrying capacity in Locality S (with competitors) can be estimated as follows. Measure the relative abundance of the species in its "fundamental" niche in Locality A (without competitors); then weigh it by the ratio of available resources in Locality S to available resources in Locality A. This method provides a possible structure for formalizing how competition transforms the "fundamental" into the "realized" niche. The method is applied to a shift in structural habitat (perch height and diameter) in some Caribbean lizards. Habitat availability is measured as relative surface area, estimated from vegetation using a new sampling technique. Results are: (1) nonlinear isoclines fit better than linear ones; (2) concave downward isoclines fit much better than convex downward isoclines; (3) an exploitative model fits better than all others, including interference and descriptive models; and (4) competitors of different sizes are more likely to fit interference than exploitative models; those of the same size show the opposite; and species best fitting interference models are more often the smaller member of pairs of differently sized competitors. © 1974.},

Spectral analysis of the matrix can help reconstruct the pattern; multivariate analysis techniques can be used to test if an observed matrix is compatible with a given tree of descent, and with the assumption of constant or of variable evolutionary rates. We call these tests of "treeness" and discuss evolutionary implications, giving also an example on human evolution. The methods can be used more generally to test if a loss of information is involved in using a tree as a formal representation of any particular set of data. © 1975.},

On the other hand, for models of molecular genetics (Crow and Kimura 1964), which assume an infinity of possible alleles for a locus, Hill (to appear) provides a definition of the linkage disequilibrium. The kinship methods also allow the calculation of that expression. A comparative study of respective influences of linkage and mutation in the two models is also examined. © 1976.},

The analysis is extended to estimating disequilibrium between three loci. In particular, the question of the sampling requirements to detect different intensities of disequilibrium is considered. It is found that relatively large samples are required to detect nonrandom association, unless gene frequencies are intermediate and disequilibrium is relatively intense. This might be one reason why cases of linkage disequilibrium have so far proved to be the exception, rather than the rule, in population studies. © 1975.},

The expected frequency of heterozygotes in small subpopulations of dioecious organisms will exceed Hardy-Weinberg expectations and this can be measured by F ̂IS. In an isolated subpopulation of constant variance effective size N, F ̂IS rapidly tends to 1 - 4N2 (N - 1 + [N2 + 1] 1 2)2. In the Island model of population structure, F ̂IS is approximately -(1 - m) N where m is the immigration rate.

The life table is the basis for a generalized population model, with immediate extension to a stable population differentiated by age, marriage and parity status. The method is quite general and could be extended, without major modification, to more complex life tables. Computation of intrinsic rates of increase for a number of populations adjusted for age, for age and parity, for age and marriage, and for age, marriage and parity shows that adjustment for marriage accounts for most of the difference between the age-adjusted rate and the age-, marriage-, and parity-adjusted rate. Adjustment for parity without adjustment for marriage may be misleading. © 1975.},

	abstract = {An examination is made of some of the ways populations can grow in response to changes in their own density. Under two different assumptions on birth and death rates, models for single-species population growth that incorporate intraspecific competition by interference but not exploitation are of logistic form. Where an individual's net energy input from feeding is inversely proportional to population size, population growth follows a convex curve, whether interference is included or not. Data of Smith (1963) on Daphnia populations are fit well by this kind of curve. Combination of the two kinds of growth can produce S-shaped curves whose inflection is displaced from that value-half the carrying capacity-given by the logistic; an upward displacement is favored by a high ratio of metabolic and replacement costs to feeding input. Inflection points from real curves are much more often higher than expected from the logistic. Nonmonotonic growth curves can arise when there is instantaneous feedback between consumers and resource availability; certain of these equations are of logistic or convex form at equilibrium. The possible effect of r- and K-selection on the biological parameters, such as feeding efficiency, used to construct the monotonie equations is discussed, and the equations are extended to 2-species competition. Table III characterizes some simple single-species growth curves. © 1973.},

Our main concern is to consider the behavior of gene frequencies and of tests of the neutral mutations model based on these gene frequencies in various circumstances, in particular where the population is geographically subdivided and also where full identification of alleles is not possible. We conclude that the effect of geographical subdivision, unless extremely strong, is quite minor, while that of non-identification is moderate. © 1974.},

The selective force acting on this gene is frequency dependent since the tendency of predators to eat the mimic varies with the abundance of the mimic itself relative to the appropriate distasteful model. Cases have been investigated both where the mimicry is limited to one sex only and where both sexes can be mimetic. This kind of selection can eventually lead to three different results: (a) fixation of the mimetic gene; (b) an interval of neutral equilibria; (c) a unique, nontrivial equilibrium. In the last case, both the trivial equilibria are unstable, both locally and globally, whereas the intermediate equilibrium can be stable or unstable. When this occurs, the gene frequency eventually undergoes stable oscillations. The results actually obtained depend mainly on the behavior of the predators and the abundance of the mimic relative to the model. © 1972.},

These components are the probabilities of the 15 possible arrangements on a set of initial gametes of those genes of which the four of interest are copies. Since identity by descent of genes is equivalent to their being copies of a single gene on an initial gamete, descent measures have inbreeding coefficients as special cases. The individual descent measure, defined for four genes on two uniting gametes can be evaluated for any pedigree by means of an algorithm developed here. If initial gametic frequencies are specified, descent measures allow genotypic frequencies and disequilibria functions at one and two loci to be found. The procedures are illustrated for selfing and for sib mating. Several applications of the descent measures are discussed. © 1973.},

	abstract = {A method is derived for computing mean gene frequencies and absorption probabilities in populations of variable size, where the probabilities of transition between the alternative population sizes can be specified. A haploid model is adopted, with two alleles at a single locus undergoing weak selection. The results are approximate, involving the first terms in a matrix series, in which the dimensions of the matrices are the number of alternative sizes the population can take, rather than the total number of population size and gene frequency states in the full model. A diffusion-equation approximation is also considered which leads to a very simple formula. It is valid when population sizes and selective values are large, but have small coefficients of variation, and when a stationary distribution of population sizes is reached quickly. A model of selective values assuming a normal distribution of fitness is used to illustrate the results. © 1972.},

	abstract = {Experimental determinations of Drosophila population dynamics cannot be explained by the Lotka-Volterra model of interspecific competition. This paper presents other possible mathematical models of competition between species, and gives the results of experiments designed to test the validity of such models. Eight of the ten new models presented contain the Lotka-Volterra model as a special case. The experiments made to test the models are of two kinds. Type 1 experiments are continuous one- or two-species populations, which permit the estimation of the carrying capacity of each species and the numbers of the two species at the point of stable equilibrium. Type 2 experiments measure the change in numbers over a short time interval in populations started with many different initial densities of the two species. Type 2 experiments give information on the dynamics of the two-species system in the phase plane whose coordinates are the number of individuals of each species. The models accounting best for the results are models five and seven (Table II). Each of these two models contains one parameter more than the Lotka-Volterra model. Model five adds a nonlinear term of self-interaction (-βiN2i). Model seven has the form, dNi/dt = riN/Kθii(Kθii - Nθi i - αijNj1-θi i). The exponential parameter θ removes the restriction of the logistic theory of population growth, that each individual added to the population decrease the rate of growth of the population by a constant amount. With model seven the rate of growth of a population of a single species need not have its maximum at K 2, that is when the number of individuals is half the carrying capacity of the environment. © 1973.},

	abstract = {In this paper a new measure of fertility is proposed which is calculated from birth interval data. The measure is a distribution function which may be defined as follows: Given that there is an (i - 1)th birth, the function Fi(x) is defined as the probability (in the absence of competing risks) that there is an ith birth within x units of time. Fi(x) is assumed to be independent of age. Fi(x | a) is the corresponding age dependent probability that is conditional on an (i - 1)th birth occurring at age a. The Fi are defective, in that, in general Fi(∞) or Fi(∞ | a) is not equal to one. The estimation of the density functions corresponding to Fi(x) and Fi(x | a) is considered for the following five sampling schemes for marriage cohorts of women: 1. (i) The women are followed from marriage to some time t and their reproductive experience is assessed-prospective cohort; 2. (ii) The survivors at some time t of a marriage cohort are sampled and their reproductive histories assessed-retrospective cohort; 3. (iii) The survivors at time t are sampled and asked about the date of the last closed interval (if existent)-retrospective last intervals; 4. (iv) The survivors at time t are sampled and followed until their next event occurs (i.e., birth, death, widowhood, divorce). The interval between the event prior to t and the one immediately after t is recorded-prospective next intervals or straddling intervals; 5. (v) The survivors to time t are followed to time T and the intervals falling in (t, T) are recorded-prospective interior intervals. Estimators are obtained in all cases except (iv) for the density of Fi(x | a). The problem of estimation of Fi(x | a) (or fi(x | a)) in a general population of married women is considered and a life table approach is recommended. Some estimates are obtained from simulation results and compared with the parameters which they estimate. The problem of obtaining an average of the Fi(x | a) over i and a is discussed and finally a brief study of the sensitivity of the proposed measure to changing contraceptive practice is conducted via simulation. © 1973.},

A complete analytic solution is obtained for a biologically reasonable special case. It is then argued, partially with the aid of computer analysis, that with moderate relaxation of assumptions of the special case, the conclusions derived from that case still hold. These conclusions are that if there is linkage a stable two locus polymorphism can result. There is permanent linkage disequilibrium with the loosing allele at the drive locus in coupling with the suppressor allele at the modifier locus, and the driven allele coupled with the modifier allele which enhances drive. It is suggested that this result explains how the SD system in Drosophila maintains its integrity in natural populations. © 1973.},

In Section 1, some of the motivations underlying the study are discussed, and in Section 2 some literature on the stochastic model of population growth underlying the foundations of the paper is briefly reviewed. Section 3, which lays the foundations for the study of a more complicated model in Section 4, is devoted to the study of the Malthusian parameter in relation to a stochastic model of human reproduction formulated as a terminating renewal process. In Section 4 the Malthusian parameter is studied in relation to a terminating Markov renewal model of human reproduction, stemming from the work of Perrin and Sheps (1964). Among the mathematical results of independent interest in this section is a complete spectral decomposition of the Laplace-Stieltjes transform of the semi-Markov transition matrix in the model of Perrin and Sheps. Section 5 is devoted to the discussion of a mathematical method which allows accomodating in the model the time taken by an individual to reach reproductive age, and Section 6 ends the paper by supplying bounds for the Malthusian parameter which are valid under quite general conditions. Possible applications of the results in evaluating what influences a population policy may have on population growth are also discussed. © 1972.},

	abstract = {When the average number of progeny born to the genotypes at a locus are linear functions of a random variable such that, on the average, the number of progeny produced by each genotype is the same (quasineutrality), then there will be a systematic pressure on gene frequency that tends to favor the genotype with the smallest variance in the number of progeny. In particular, there will be a stable equilibrium attained whenever the variance in the number of progeny produced by the heterozygous genotype is less than that of both homozygous genotypes. We assume that the random variable affecting fitness is some function of an underlying environmental variable that tends to smooth out the day-to-day fluctuations in the environmental variable, such as the mean or the range or the variance. The effect of the environment on fitness can, therefore, be assumed to be approximately constant for periods corresponding to one generation. If the logarithm of the average number of progeny is a linear function of a random variable, then in contrast to the foregoing conclusions, there will be no tendency for any change in gene frequency at the locus (Kimura, M. (1954), Process leading to quasi-fixation of genes in natural populations due to random fluctuations of selection intensities, Genetics 39, 280-295; (1964), Diffusion models in population genetics, J.

A wide variety of random mating systems are subject to selection with modifiers operating, in different cases, on mutation rates, migration between subpopulations, and linkage between other loci. In all these instances, the modifier frequencies evolve in such a way as to maximize the mean fitness of the population at equilibrium. This is remarkable since, the modifier genes are selectively neutral in the sense that they do not affect the fitness of their individual carriers. In nonrandom mating systems, the mean fitness concept is not well-defined, and there does not appear to be such a simple principle governing the evolution of modifier frequencies. In assortative mating systems, modifiers favoring reduced assortment propensities tend to increase. In contrast, for selfing-outcrossing systems, modifiers favoring increased selfing tend to increase. © 1974.},

A direct correlation was found between Song Sparrow territory size and the number of co-occurring potential competitor species. As the number of competitors decreased, the Song Sparrow territory size decreased. The mechanism through which this decrease occurs is that of competitive release, as realized niche approaches fundamental niche with reduced competitor diversity. Theoretical predictions of Song Sparrow territory size utilizing various forms of α-values were made; results supported the conclusion that competitive release had occurred and that Song Sparrows had expanded ecologically into niches vacated by absent competitors. © 1974.},

Method 2 gives equations which are closely related to Fisher's Malthusian parameter equations, and are good approximations even with quite strong selection (30% selection coefficients) in the case of a single autosomal locus. When there is strong heterotic selection, however, Method 2 gives a bad fit to the population's behaviour in the neighbourhood of equilibrium, but a good fit elsewhere. Method 1 gives a good fit near equilibrium, but a bad fit when gene frequencies change rapidly. With strong heterotic selection, therefore, no single set of selection parameters is adequate, but in other single locus cases, the genotypic intrinsic rates of increases may be used, except when selection is very intense. In multilocus situations it is shown that further specializing assumptions have to be made for this to be true. The asymptotic states of populations under various selection regimes are determined for the case of a single locus with two alleles, when the direction of selective differences remains constant throughout the life-span of an individual. © 1974.},

It may also be considered on the genetic level; the question is to then know to what extent the kinship involves the possession of the same genes. This problem is far from being academic; it may have medical implications. Graft compatibility requires that the genes present in the donor's genotype be present in the recipient's genotype (if not, the donor's genes control the formation of antigenic substances against which the recipient is able to produce antibodies which cause rejection), or even that the donor's and recipient's genotypes are the same (particularly for marrow graft). For two given individuals, the probability of graft compatibility clearly depends on the number of loci involved, the number and frequencies of the alleles, and the parental relationship of the individuals. Limiting our reasoning to the case where the reject process is dependent on only one locus, we show herein how the knowledge of genealogies, as complicated as they may be, allows us to determine this probability as a function of genes frequencies. These frequencies, however, are often unknown. We compare the probabilities of compatibility resulting from various hypotheses on genes repartition. © 1974.},

	abstract = {The life history attributes which maximize fitness can be established analytically through Fisher's equation for reproductive value. Maximizing the reproductive value at age zero is equivalent to maximizing the ultimate rate of increase. As an example of the usefulness of this equality it is shown that when survivorship is uniformly reduced, the corresponding optimal maternal frequency is unaltered, even though the ultimate rate of increase is lowered by a known amount. A general life history model is proposed which links these demographic determinants of rate of increase with the energy utilization alternatives (as among maintenance, growth, and reproduction) characterizing an individual organism's development. Since the energy partitioning alternatives at any age may depend on previous allocations, an organism state variable is introduced to describe the domain over which the maximization of reproductive value may take place. Further, if the reproductive value is to be a maximum at age zero, it must be maximized at every age. An optimal life history, then, is characterized by the energy allocations which maximize sequential reproductive values. Further examples of the utility of the model focus on growth vs reproduction decisions under biomass specific life history attributes. It is shown that if births per unit energy is a linear or convex function, then an organism will not simultaneously grow and reproduce. Determinant growth, biomass at first reproduction, and explicit calculation of the maximum ultimate rate of increase are also illustrated. © 1974.},

	abstract = {Models of two simple genetic systems of two alleles segregating at two loci are used to study the evolution of dominance of a Batesian mimic maintained in a population by frequency-dependent selection. The alleles at one locus determine the mimetic patterns, and their dominance is modified by the alleles at the other locus. In the model, the modifiers of dominance may themselves be either fully dominant or have additive effects on the dominance of the mimics. When the modifier is fully dominant in its effect on the dominance of a new mimic, the mimic will evolve dominance irrespective of the initial frequency of the modifier. When the modifiers act additively on the dominance of the mimics, a new mimic will evolve either dominance or recessiveness depending on the initial frequency of the modifiers. Unless the modifier is initially at quite a high frequency dominance will not evolve. And dominance will not evolve fully unless the modifiers are more or less selectively neutral in their effects on all other characters except the mimicry. The significance of these results is discussed with reference to the different dominance relations of the mimics in different races of the butterfly Papilio dardanus. © 1973.},

	abstract = {The probability distributions of certain Markov stochastic epidemic models in a finite homogeneous population are derived. It is assumed that the epidemic is generated by contagion as well as by mutation (or random occurrences) and no recovery and removal of infectives are allowed for. This model includes the simple stochastic epidemic defined by Bailey (1957) as a special case, in which no mutation is assumed. Let Pj(t) be the probability that there are j infectives up to time t. The usual approach of investigating this type of models is to examine the system of differential-difference equations or the generating function of the probabilities Pj(t). If this approach leads to a closed form solution, the computation required is often extremely laborious. One such example is the solution for simple stochastic epidemics obtained by Bailey (1957, 1963). A much simpler method is presented in this paper in which the information on the interarrival times of the infectives is utilized to calculate the exact probability Pj(t) and the distribution of the duration of the epidemic. The procedure involves essentially the convolution of exponential densities which avoids the necessity of solving the differential equations associated with Pj(t). © 1972.},

It was shown that when a population is subdivided, the amount of linkage disequilibrium is determined by the local population size if the recombination fraction is much larger than the migration rates. Also, it was shown that the associative overdominance temporarily creates a sort of inertia against perturbation in gene frequencies even if it cannot endow any definite equilibrium values. Hence, it has no long term effect on the rate of mutant substitution in evolution. © 1973.},

	abstract = {In defining the substitutional load in a finite population, one can use a definition relating to the total load suffered until substitution of a favoured allele occurs (this will normally involve a contribution to the load from a number of cases where the favoured allele is lost), or one can use a definition using the load only for a single substitution process in which successful substitution of the favoured allele does occur. It is not evident at the moment which definition will be the more useful and meaningful in discussing how load arguments might limit the rate of selectively controlled gene substitutions. In this paper relatively simple methods are used to find formulae for both loads (the formula for the first confirming a previous result of Kimura and Maruyama, 1969). Numerical comparisons of the two loads are given, together with the results of a Monte Carlo experiment confirming the theoretical value for the second load. The latter theoretical value is found by considering a conditional diffusion process, the condition being that the favoured allele is eventually fixed. This diffusion process can be used, amongst other things, to arrive at the formulae for the mean and variance of the conditional fixation time found by other methods by Kimura and Ohta (1969a, b). © 1972.},

	abstract = {The factors which are likely to limit niche overlap are studied for a class of idealized biological communities in which several species compete on a onedimensional continuum of resources, e.g., food size. Although the shape of the resource spectrum restricts the composition of possible equilibrium communities, and although this restriction is increasingly stringent as niche overlap increases, such considerations do not in principle put a limit to niche overlap. In analysing the stability of these equilibrium communities, two qualitatively different circumstances need be distinguished. In a strictly unvarying (deterministic) environment, stability sets no limit to the degree of overlap, short of complete congruence. However, in a randomly fluctuating (stochastic) environment, community stability requires that the average food sizes for species adjacent on the resource spectrum must differ by an amount roughly equal to the standard deviation in the food size taken by either individual species. This limit to species packing has a weak (logarithmic) dependence on the degree of environmental variance. This mathematical result is very robust, as is shown by considering, inter alia, a wide range of resource spectrum shapes, and a variety of shapes for the functions describing how the species utilize the resource. The effect of including additional resource dimensions is estimated. The general conclusion from the model is that there is an effective limit to niche overlap in the real world, and that this limit is insensitive to the degree of environmental fluctuation, unless it be very severe. This conclusion seems in accord with an increasing body of field data. © 1974.},

	abstract = {A stochastic discrete time model of a two prey, one predator interaction, an extension of one and two species models proposed by Leslie (1958) and Leslie and Gower (1958, 1960), is studied. Monte Carlo simulations and the stability properties of the analogous continuous time deterministic model suggest the following hypotheses. (1) The two prey, one predator interaction is in general unstable. The range of parameters allowing coexistence of all three species is small. (2) Deterministically the predator always survives. (3) If the parameters defining the effects of density on the rates of population growth are large, the simulations lead to the rapid extinction of all three species or all but one of the prey species even if the interaction is deterministically stable. (4) The outcome of this three species interaction is largely probabilistic over a wide range of parameters. (5) A prey species with a competitive advantage over a second prey species may still find it difficult to invade and displace the second prey species if the density of the second prey species is high. Increasing the density of the predator offsets this numerical advantage somewhat. (6) The introduction of a predator common to two noncompeting species of prey usually leads to the extinction of one of the prey species. (7) In a stable two prey, one predator interaction the fluctuations of the two prey species are nonperiodic and erratic. The fluctuations of the rarer prey species are damped relative to the commoner species and the fluctuations of the rarer prey species behave as if the series has no fixed mean abundance. The predator population fluctuates with a remarkably constant period. The relevance of these hypotheses to the problem of relating population stability and persistence with the number of species in a community is discussed. © 1974.},

	abstract = {Evolution of a cultural trait has been considered at a theoretical level. Cultural evolution is to be kept distinct from biological evolution, but the discrimination of the two may be difficult in actual cases. In cultural evolution, not only the parents of an individual but also other members of the group, contribute directly to determining the value of a trait in the individual. The cumulative effect of members of the group other than the parents has been called the group effect g. The expected value of the trait of an individual in the next generation has been assumed in the model to be the weighted mean of the individual value (as determined by the trait values in the parent or parents plus a random contribution E the new variation per generation), and the group mean value, the individual and the group contributions being weighted as (1 - g) to g. Effects of age and peers and of generations earlier than parental have also been analyzed. It has been demonstrated that, if g is different from zero and positive, however small, in spite of new variation arising at every generation the variation of the trait within the group will stabilize at a finite level. The stable amount of the variation depends on the mode of transmission, which has been considered here to be either uniparental or biparental, on the value of g, on the size of the group if the progeny size is not constant, and on the amount of new variation produced per generation. Independent groups will differentiate one from the other randomly, at a rate which is a function of the mode of transmission (uni or biparental), the g value, and the size of the group. Ways to study discontinuous traits have been given. If discontinuity arises from imposition of a perceptive threshold on the existing variation, and therefore the variate is not truly discontinuous, its behavior is still predictable by the same rules, and a transformation for study of the frequencies of observations above or below threshold has been given, which permits the prediction of the trend of changes with time. A truly discontinuous character will undergo fixation of one or other character state, as for alleles in random genetic drift, but the rate of fixation will be decreased by group action. © 1973.},

New concepts that are introduced include the intrinsic age-specific birth rates and the intrinsic gross and net reproduction rates for males and females. These intrinsic rates for the two sexes can coexist in a stable population unlike the same rates in the conventional sense which are sex-wise internally inconsistent.

Using a Lotka-Volterra model, the ease of invasion by a third species into a guild already containing two species is examined for various shapes of resource utilization curves. I show that (a) a guild is more easily invasible and allows tighter packing if its member species have leptokurtic (thick-tailed) resource utilization curves than if they have platykurtic (thin-tailed) curves; (b) the distribution of niche separation distances is bimodal in a "thin-tailed" guild and is unimodal in a "thick-tailed" guild; (c) there are three-species guilds such that removal of one particular species leaves a two-species system in which one of the remaining species excludes the other. In this context, competition pressure is a force maintaining species diversity. Groupers (Serranidae) appear to be a thin-tailed guild, and Parrotfish (Scaridae) and Surgeonfish (Acanthuridae) together appear to be a thick-tailed guild, and these guilds show many properties predicted by the model. I conjecture that thick-tailed guilds form when the constituent species are selected to be generalists and apply this idea to tropical fruit- and flower-feeding birds. © 1974.},

In each case, without restricting the mating system, differential equations are derived for the genotypic frequencies, and the validity of the customary Malthusian-parameter differential equations for the gametic frequencies is established. Particular attention is devoted to the conditions for Hardy-Weinberg proportions under random mating. For multiple alleles at a single locus in a monoecious population, exact solutions are obtained for the following three Hardy-Weinberg models: gametic selection, no dominance, and the same selective effect for all alleles but one. The last scheme includes, as special cases, a completely dominant or recessive distinguished allele, and arbitrary selection with only two alleles. Two single-locus assortative mating patterns are analyzed for a monoecious organism using the general formalism. One of these has an arbitrary number of alleles, all the genotypes being distinguishable, while the other involves two alleles, one of which is completely dominant to the other. © 1974.},

This leads to the question, in what circumstances can two measurable quantities, x1 and x2, be regarded as different resources for the purposes of the theorem, and it is shown that if x1 is functionally dependent on x2, so that a knowledge of one value at any time specifies the other, then they are the same resource, but that otherwise they can act as different resources, even if they are highly correlated. It is shown that variables such as climate and invading species, which are not themselves influenced by the densities of the species to be limited, are irrelevant in determining the number of resources or limiting factors present. © 1972.},

We restrict consideration to extinction of populations at or near habitat carrying capacity, thus modeling the kind of situation envisioned by Wynne-Edwards (1962). Under the assumption that the extinction rate is large relative to individual genetic parameters, we discuss the effect of differential extinction on the distribution of gene frequencies within boundary micropopulations. In these circumstances, it is shown that differential extinction is most likely to produce a bimodal distribution of the gene frequencies if the form of the extinction operator approximates a step function, with a critical allele frequency at which the extinction rate shifts from high to low. The need for a rather close approximation to such discontinuous behavior limits the possible conditions under which differential extinction might be important. We conclude with a comparison of our model with that of Levins (1970a) and suggest some technically feasible generalizations of our approach. © 1973.},

	abstract = {For a polymorphism to be maintained at a single locus in a small population through heterozygote advantage, symmetry or near symmetry of selection against the two homozygotes is important. However a consideration of chromosome segments rather than single loci suggests that this result does not necessarily extend to the situation where there are many linked loci, and suggests that in the extreme there may be some stability with dominance or partial dominance at individual loci rather than overdominance. It is shown algebraically that, if an intrinsically neutral locus is linked to a locus with dominance of selective values, the heterozygote at the neutral locus is expected to have an apparent selective value greater than or equal to the mean of the two homozygotes. Linkage of the neutral locus to a number of loci of this type is thus expected to lead to an apparent heterozygote advantage, which may lead to increased stability at the neutral locus. Computer simulation has been used to show that in a multiple-locus model with dominance of selective values there is increased stability at the loci themselves, and also at linked neutral loci. The stability is, however, considerably less than with an equivalent set of overdominant loci with the same overall heterozygote advantage. An excess of repulsion over coupling linkages (i.e., negative linkage disequilibrium) has been shown to be important in increasing stability with the dominance model, and it has been shown that the amount of negative disequilibrium in a population appears to increase slowly over time. Overall the results suggest that heterosis at the level of the chromosome does imply some stability regardless of whether this is attributable to dominance or overdominance at individual loci. © 1972.},

As with two loci, the three-locus disequilibrium declines exponentially at all generations, but for m > 3 loci a matrix has to be constructed to give joint changes in the m-locus disequilibrium and products of disequilibria with fewer loci, for example of two m 2-locus disequilibria. The asymptotic rates of change in multilocus disequilibria depend on the arrangement of genes on the chromosome as well as its total length, but the initial rate of breakdown of disequilibrium from a line cross base is less dependent on the arrangement. With equally spaced loci the asymptotic rate of breakdown of m locus disequilibrium is roughly proportional to m. Although mutation and interference are excluded from the main analysis, it is shown how they can be incorporated. © 1974.},

The independence of geographical structure for the latter two quantities is not exact if there is selection, but is a close approximation. The model is a geographically structured version of Moran's haploid overlapping generation model. The population consists of colonies connected genetically by migration. Each individual has the same negative exponential lifetime distribution. When an individual dies, it is immediately replaced by an individual born in the same colony with a probability proportional to the frequency and fitness of the type giving birth. In a diploid population the quantity x(1 - x) is proportional to the heterozygosity. © 1974.},

	abstract = {In considering populations of finite size, there are two approaches to studying the correlation of genotype frequencies at two linked loci. The first is based on disequilibrium parameters, and the second on identity-by-descent methods. The basic connection between the two approaches may be stated in the following way. The expected square of the correlation of gene frequencies at two loci r2 = D2 pApapBpb, is approximately equal to Q, the probability that, given two genes at one locus which are identical by descent, then the two genes at the second locus will be identical by descent through the same pathways. Using this relationship it is shown that for a monoecious population of effective size Ne with no selection, the expected value of r2 will tend to approximately 1 (1 + 4Nec), where c is the recombination frequency, the rate of approach being given by (1 - 1 2Ne)(1 - c)2. Computer simulation has shown that this formula holds with reasonable accuracy, and that it is also quite accurate in populations with heterozygote advantage stabilizing gene frequencies. It is suggested that the measurement of linkage disequilibrium in natural populations might thus be used to give information about the effective population size. The identity-by-descent approach is extended to derive the distribution of the length of homozygous chromosome segment surrounding a locus which is identical by descent. The mean such length is approximately 1 2Ne(log Ne - 1). It is suggested that a general theory of stability of the genotype in small populations might be based on parameters such as this. © 1971.},

The result is completely general, applying to systems with an arbitrary number of mating types based upon an arbitrary genetic basis.

Isoplethy automatically satisfies the necessary condition for each model. The same is true for the restrictive situation that has been referred to as "proportional partitioning." In dimorphic systems, any equilibrium must be either isoplethic or proportionally partitioned. In systems with more than two mating types, the necessary condition for equilibrium can be satisfied by other, anisoplethic methods; however, for such equilibria the necessary conditions are different for the limited competition model and the mass action model. © 1971.},

	abstract = {The behaviour of recessive lethals under recurrent mutation in small populations has been investigated using matrix methods. Equilibrium gene frequencies are then far from their infinite population values and are comparatively insensitive to selection on the heterozygote. Particular emphasis was paid to the allelism, both within and between generations. The life statistics of individual lethals, underlying the similarity between successive generations, was investigated and expressions given for the average age and subsequent expectation of life of lethals present in the population at any time. At equilibrium, the two are equal and the values found from the computer using matrix methods were surprisingly high. For a population size of 50, the average age of lethals, neutral in the heterozygote, present at any time is 10.2 generations. This produces a high correlation between observations in successive generations which leads to great difficulty in obtaining accurate estimates of parameters in any population. For instance, with N = 50 and an overall mutation rate of 0.005, the mean lethal frequency estimated from an analysis of 80 successive generations had a sampling variance slightly larger than the binomial sampling variance from a sample of 100 chromosomes from a single generation. As a consequence, results from single populations are of little value. The effect of linkage was studied using simulation methods. It was found that, for lethals neutral in the heterozygote, linkage had no detectable effect at equilibrium on the proportion of chromosomes containing a lethal or on the allelism between them. Individual lethals appeared to have a slightly higher expectation of life in the absence of crossing over. © 1971.},

The modes of selection studied were heterotic selection with constant fitness values and simple frequency-dependent selection proposed earlier by this author. The latter model was based upon the existence of an optimal allele frequency for each locus. In the first study, the total genetic load was divided into three categories: one due to segregating populations, another due to populations fixed with A allele, and the last due to populations fixed with a allele. In most populations (effective size of a few hundred), there were essentially no genetic loads in any of the three categories under frequency-dependent selection, but the heterosis model produced 10 to 100 times more genetic load, most of it coming from segregating populations. In very small populations there was no difference in such a comparison. The second comparison was the pseudo-segregational load comparison, when the allele frequency was shifted from the point of equilibrium in a given population of finite size. The third comparison was the ratio of expected segregational loads due to sampling errors. The last two comparisons of segregational loads under the heterotic and frequency-dependent selection modes were limited to one generation of various finite-size populations. The concept of frequency-dependent selection was discussed as the most likely mode of natural selection for maintaining balanced polymorphisms. © 1971.},

	abstract = {A three-parameter second-order autoregressive process is suggested as a suitable discrete-time stochastic model for the instantaneous growth rate of a population whose mode of growth is basically exponential. Rather complicated formulae are derived for the moments of the population size, but these formulae do have simple asymptotic forms which are shown to be reasonably accurate for smaller values of the time parameter. The relevant equations are numbered (25), (26) and (27). Several numerical examples are given. The model may be of use in dealing with certain actuarial problems when the rate of interest is a random variable. It is necessary, however, to take into account age-specific mortality and the correlation between the present values of payments made at different points of time. Because of these added complications and the fact that actuarial notation is necessary, the details of these methods are not included here. The author hopes to publish a paper on these techniques in an actuarial journal in the not-too-distant future (J. H. Pollard, 1970). The present model has many desirable features, but we cannot claim that it is appropriate in all circumstances. We may be interested in a discrete-time process in which the instantaneous growth rate in year t is anticipated to be δt, for example. The actual instantaneous rate δt will be different from this, and it might be appropriate to assume that δt - δt = 2k(δt - 1 - δt - 1) - k(δt - 2 - δt - 2) + et. The methods described above are still applicable, and only a few of the formulae require rather minor alterations. © 1970.},

	abstract = {This paper gives a development of ideas presented in a previous paper on the dynamics of haploid genetic populations in an infinite habitat. A brief review of necessary ideas and a discussion of a concept of value for haploid populations are given. A general model for a diploid population, which incorporates life tables, mating of individuals, and fecundities is presented and general recursive relationships for frequencies of genetic types developed. Because of its intractability special cases are then considered in which there is equal fecundity of all matings in the population of matings that occurs. It is found that in some cases the numbers of the various types increase asymptotically at geometric rates, so that each type may be said to have a Malthusian parameter. It is then found that a version of Fisher's Fundamental Theorem holds in that the asymptotic rate of increase of the average Malthusian parameter is equal to the genotypic variance in this parameter. Additionally, the Malthusian parameters are found to be additive. It does not seem possible, however, to extend the concept of value to diploid mating populations. © 1971.},

Without expressing any view on this question, this paper considers some consequences of the concept once it is accepted. It suggests that it is important to view the concept by considering the various substitutions in progress during any generation, rather than by following through the substitution process at one locus over many generations. It then appears that the maximum substitution rate is rather higher than suggested by Haldane and subsequently Kimura. In particular, the observed rates of gene substitution in mammals to not appear incompatible with values of selective differences of order 0.001-0.1. A consequence is that it does not appear necessary to conclude, with Kimura (1968), that most substitutions refer to neutral or nearly neutral alleles. © 1970.},

The statistical procedures for bioassay may be improved, but even at this early stage of investigation it appears that, because of its wealth of genetic implications, kinship as defined is the best measure of relationship or biological similarity between two populations. The theory is illustrated by data of Workman and Niswander (1970) on polymorphisms of Papago Indians, and their genetic distance parameter (derived from Sanghvi) is shown to be a simple function of kinship and a good estimator. More efficient and unbiased estimators are given. © 1971.},

Thus, for these cases the rate is proportional to migration rate but independent of colony size N. When the inequality is reversed, the rate is approximately equal to 1 4nN. Thus, it is equal to the rate in a panmixing population of 2nN diploid individuals which implies the effect of subdividing disappeared as far as the rate of decrease is concerned. Approximation for the eigenvector associated with a dominant eigenvalue was also obtained. © 1970.},

In a finite, random-mating monoecious population, it will usually be the case that one locus will fix first, followed by fixation of the other locus. The probabilities for which locus will fix first, which alleles will become fixed, and the rates at which these fixations occur, are found in terms of the recombination fraction for the pair of loci in question, and the initial state of the population. Most of the results are at least qualitatively similar to those found by Karlin and McGregor (1968) (Genetics 58, 141-159) for a different model, but fixation of the first locus is found to be quickest with tight but not complete linkage, in contrast with their conclusion that looser linkage speeds first-fixation. © 1970.},

	abstract = {Allelic polymorphism is well known in cases where the heterozygote is fitter than either homozygote (Fisher, 1958, p. 114ff). By contrast, we consider a model where the tactics of a predator and its prey are both controlled by genetic factors which exhibit pure Mendelian dominance. Using a deterministic, differential-equation approximation we prove that, under suitable conditions, the system has a unique equilibrium point where each species is dimorphic at the locus controlling its behavior. At the equilibrium, each species, taken as a whole, uses its tactics in the proportions of the game-theoretic optimal mixed strategy. The equilibrium is strongly stable in the sense that oscillations about it are damped out exponentially. Interestingly, the corresponding haploid model does not exhibit this type of damping. Our object is to give a detailed mathematical analysis of a model which makes explicit one possible form of interspecific interaction. This example illustrates very clearly the genetic feedback mechanism discussed by Pimentel (1961, 1965) and exhibits a form of competitive selection quite different from that considered by Nei (to appear). © 1971.},

To represent the mode of production of molecular mutants, two models were considered. One is the "model of infinite sites" and the other is the "model of infinite alleles.". In the model of infinite sites, it is assumed that the number of nucleotide sites making up the genome is so large while the mutation rate per site is so low that whenever a mutant appears it represents a mutation at a new site. This was used to investigate such problems as the behavior of mutants in a finite population, the rate of mutant substitution in evolution, and the amount of heterozygosity and linkage disequilibrium under steady flux of mutations. In the model of infinite alleles, it is assumed that the number of possible allelic states of a cistron is so large that whenever a mutant appears it represents a new, not preexisting allele. This was used to investigate the number of alleles and probability of polymorphism in a finite population. A hypothesis that mutants are selectively neutral at the majority of sites but are selected at a relatively small number of sites was examined, and the roles of associative overdominance and subdivided population structure in maintaining genetic variability were considered. © 1971.},

The values obtained are compared with computer simulation results with ten linked loci. It is shown that a greater advance can be obtained by allowing the proportion selected to vary over generations, the proportion selected declining as selection proceeds. The increase in advance over that with the optimum fixed proportion selected is never more than a few per cent. If the total number of individuals measured in the whole selection programme is fixed, the length of the selection programme being variable, the optimum proportion selection is always 0.27, independent of the other parameters. Optimum solutions are given for a fixed number of individuals measured each generation as well as when this is allowed to vary. The best strategy is to measure a number of individuals each generation which declines linearly with time. The variable strategy then gives about 12% more advance than the fixed. © 1970.},

Here the problem is turned around. Given a desired sequence of population numbers, and assuming constant mortality and zero net migration, what birth sequence is required? It is shown in a continuous model that the birth sequence must eventually approach a constant if population numbers are constant; an exponential if population numbers grow exponentially (both rates must be the same); and a linear sequence if the population grow linearly (with the annual increase in number of births equal to the annual population increase divided by the life expectancy). That is, no compensating cyclical fluctuations in the annual number of births are possible for any of these populations after a certain point in time. Thus a "Malthusian" population is the only closed population consistent in the long-run with a constant population growth rate and constant age-specific rates of mortality. © 1970.},

Further, we establish the role of linkage in determining the rate of evolution. Specifically we show that in both the initial and final stages of the process the looser the linkage the faster the progress towards complete dominance.

	abstract = {Two models for the evolution of species in which the females are diploid and the males are haploid have been analyzed in detail. In both models we suppose that some factor overcomes the barriers to the development of unfertilized eggs; in one case, the factor is assumed to be an environmental variable; in the other model the factor is a newly mutated gene. In both cases there follows a population in which haploid males and diploid males coexist. Whether the mixed population is stable depends on the value of 2vs (1 - u), where u and v are the fractions of eggs left unfertilized by the diploid and haploid males, respectively, and where s is the fitness of haploid males relative to diploids. If 2vs (1 - u) ≥ 1, the haploid males replace the diploids; otherwise, the mixed population is permanent. When the fitnesses of the haploid males are different in successive generations, then s is their geometric mean. These calculations show that male haploidy can evolve in a single, panmictic, diplodiploid population by a process which is not very different from the replacement of one gene by another. The rarity of haplodiploidy in nature can be attributed to the infrequency with which diplodiploid populations would be expected to satisfy simultaneously the stringent preconditions required for arrhenotoky to be possible, and to the small chance that haploid males could compete favorably with diploid males. Haplodiploid populations tend toward and maintain sex ratios in which the ratio of males to females is one-to-one, provided that the populations are undergoing random mating and provided that a negligible fraction of females remains unmated. © 1970.},

	abstract = {The "diversity" of a statistical sample is studied in relation to some simple ideal distributions of species within the sample. A correlation found by Tramer (1969) between the diversity of bird censuses and the number S of species is shown to agree (a) fairly well with the distribution of species described by a Dirichlet series, and (b) remarkably well with MacArthur's "broken-stick" distribution. It is shown that for large values of S the "broken-stick" distribution tends to a continuous gamma-distribution, from which some simple relations can be derived theoretically; for instance the number of species in the modal octave is to the total number of species in the sample in the ratio (log 2) e = 0.255. This is in agreement with some observations by Preston (1962a). The gammadistribution can be approximated by a special log-normal distribution-one having standard deviation σ = 1 on the natural scale. This again agrees with Preston's (1962a) data. The general log-normal distribution is also studied and it is shown that if the "tails" of the distribution are not truncated, then the diversity H is given by the simple relation H = log S - 1 2σ2. More generally, when the curve is truncated at a veil-point on the left, then the difference between H and log S is thereby reduced. The difference | H - log S | is tabulated, and some applications are discussed. © 1971.},

	abstract = {This paper describes tests of hypotheses concerning the equality of any k standardized mortality ratios (or, equivalently, of any k indirect adjusted rates) from p(≥k) populations. The distinction is made between the situation where the standard population is chosen independently of the p populations and one where the standard is formed by pooling all p populations. Different test procedures are required for these two situations. When the pooled standard is used, the appropriate test procedure is applicable only when k = p. Experimental evidence is given showing that when the pooled standard is used both test procedures lead to the same conclusion concerning the hypothesis for the case k = p. The recommendation is made, therefore, to use the "incorrect" test procedure when the standard is a pooled one even when k < p. © 1971.},

	abstract = {In this paper, a series of fertility models are presented as progressive extensions of the basic ideas behind the life table. Dimensions like age, parity, marital status, birth interval, and marital status duration are introduced in turn, and interrelations between the various models are indicated. The main arguments are developed in connection with a model which includes age- and parity-specificity. The various net (influenced) and gross (partial) fertility measures are given some consideration. It turns out that retrospective fertility investigations give rise to a third kind of functions, which are denoted purged measures. These are parallel to but conceptually distinct from the gross measures. The introduction of the purged measures seems to throw some light on aspects of the theory which have previously appeared problematic. The models are formulated in terms of transition probabilities rather than survivorship functions. In a final section, it is argued that the latter are superfluous and even potentially harmful. © 1970.},
