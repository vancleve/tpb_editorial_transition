Title = {Host control and species interactions jointly determine microbiome
   community structure},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {158},
Pages = {185-194},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The host microbiome can be considered an ecological community of
   microbes present inside a complex and dynamic host environment. The host
   is under selective pressure to ensure that its microbiome remains
   beneficial. The host can impose a range of ecological filters including
   the immune response that can influence the assembly and composition of
   the microbial community. How the host immune response interacts with the
   within-microbiome community dynamics to affect the assembly of the
   microbiome has been largely unexplored. We present here a mathematical
   framework to elucidate the role of host immune response and its
   interaction with the balance of ecological interactions types within the
   microbiome community. We find that highly mutualistic microbial
   communities characteristic of high community density are most
   susceptible to changes in immune control and become invasion prone as
   host immune control strength is increased. Whereas highly competitive
   communities remain relatively stable in resisting invasion to changing
   host immune control. Our model reveals that the host immune control can
   interact in unexpected ways with a microbial community depending on the
   prevalent ecological interactions types for that community. We stress
   the need to incorporate the role of host-control mechanisms to better
   understand microbiome community assembly and stability.},

Title = {Cultural niche construction with application to fertility control: A
   model for education and social transmission of contraceptive use},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {153},
Pages = {1-14},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The evolution of a cultural trait may be affected by niche construction,
   or changes in the selective environment of that trait due to the
   inheritance of other cultural traits that make up a cultural background.
   This study investigates the evolution of a cultural trait, such as the
   acceptance of the idea of contraception, that is both vertically and
   horizontally transmitted within a homogeneous social network.
   Individuals may conform to the norm, and adopters of the trait have
   fewer progeny than others. In addition, adoption of this trait is
   affected by a vertically transmitted aspect of the cultural background,
   such as the preference for high or low levels of education. Our model
   shows that such cultural niche construction can facilitate the spread of
   traits with low Darwinian fitness while providing an environment that
   counteracts conformity to norms. In addition, niche construction can
   facilitate the `demographic transition' by making reduced fertility
   socially accepted. \& COPY; 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier

Title = {Modeling and migration-based control of depopulation},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {148},
Pages = {86-94},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This study deals with the problem of the population shrinking in
   habitats affected by aging and excessive migration outflows. First, a
   control-oriented population dynamics model was proposed that catches the
   effect of depopulation. The model also includes the effect of spatial
   interaction-driven migration flows on population size. The resulting
   model is a non-homogeneous ordinary differential equation. It includes
   such phenomena that are important from the control point of view, such
   as the influence of migration costs on population dynamics, the impact
   of aging on population size, or the effect of the habitats' carrying
   capacity on migration flows. Based on the model, controllability
   conditions are formulated and a control strategy was developed that is
   meant to avoid the depopulation of the habitat. The control method acts
   on the migration costs to achieve the control goal and requires only
   population size measurements. Simulation measurements are presented in
   the paper to show the effectiveness of the proposed modeling and control
   methods.(c) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc. This is an

Title = {Kleptoparasitic interactions modeling varying owner and intruder hunger
   awareness},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {136},
Pages = {31-40},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {We consider a game theoretical model of kleptoparasitic interaction
   between two individuals, the Owner and the Intruder. The Owner is in
   possession of a resource and must decide whether to defend the resource
   against the Intruder or flee. If the Owner defends, the Intruder must
   decide whether to fight with the Owner or flee. The outcome of the fight
   depends on the hunger of the individuals, the hungrier the individual
   is, the more likely they are to win the fight. We consider three
   scenarios: (a) both individuals know their own and their opponent's
   hunger, (b) individuals only know their own hunger but not that of their
   opponent, and (c) individuals do not know their own nor the opponent's
   hunger levels. We determine Nash equilibrium strategies in each
   scenario. We conclude that Owner is generally willing to defend more
   often than the Intruder is willing to attack. Also, the Intruder's
   payoff is largest in the full information case; but the Owner may
   benefit in the no information or partial information cases when the cost
   of the fight is neither too large nor too small. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {We revisit the model by Wiser et al. (2013), which describes how the
   mean fitness increases over time due to beneficial mutations in Lenski's
   long-term evolution experiment. We develop the model further both
   conceptually and mathematically. Conceptually, we describe the
   experiment with the help of a Cannings model with mutation and
   selection, where the latter includes diminishing returns epistasis. The
   analysis sheds light on the growth dynamics within every single day and
   reveals a runtime effect, that is, the shortening of the daily growth
   period with increasing fitness; and it allows to clarify the
   contribution of epistasis to the mean fitness curve. Mathematically, we
   explain rigorous results in terms of a law of large numbers (in the
   limit of infinite population size and for a certain asymptotic parameter
   regime), and present approximations based on heuristics and supported by
   simulations for finite populations. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {A two-player iterated survival game},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {125},
Pages = {38-55},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {We describe an iterated game between two players, in which the payoff is
   to survive a number of steps. Expected payoffs are probabilities of
   survival. A key feature of the game is that individuals have to survive
   on their own if their partner dies. We consider individuals with
   hardwired, unconditional behaviors or strategies. When both players are
   present, each step is a symmetric two-player game. The overall survival
   of the two individuals forms a Markov chain. As the number of iterations
   tends to infinity, all probabilities of survival decrease to zero. We
   obtain general, analytical results for n-step payoffs and use these to
   describe how the game changes as n increases. In order to predict
   changes in the frequency of a cooperative strategy over time, we embed
   the survival game in three different models of a large, well mixed
   population. Two of these models are deterministic and one is stochastic.
   Offspring receive their parent's type without modification and fitnesses
   are determined by the game. Increasing the number of iterations changes
   the prospects for cooperation. All models become neutral in the limit (n
   -> infinity). Further, if pairs of cooperative individuals survive
   together with high probability, specifically higher than for any other
   pair and for either type when it is alone, then cooperation becomes
   favored if the number of iterations is large enough. This holds
   regardless of the structure of pairwise interactions in a single step.
   Even if the single-step interaction is a Prisoner's Dilemma, the
   cooperative type becomes favored. Enhanced survival is crucial in these
   iterated evolutionary games: if players in pairs start the game with a
   fitness deficit relative to lone individuals, the prospects for
   cooperation can become even worse than in the case of a single-step
   game. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Genealogies and ages of cultural traits: An application of the theory of
   duality to the research on cultural evolution},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {123},
Pages = {18-27},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {A finite-population, discrete-generation model of cultural evolution is
   described, in which multiple discrete traits are transmitted
   independently. In this model, each newborn may inherit a trait from
   multiple cultural parents. Transmission fails with a positive
   probability unlike in population genetics. An ancestral process
   simulating the cultural genealogy of a sample of individuals is derived
   for this model. This ancestral process, denoted by M-, is shown to be
   dual to a process M+ describing the change in the frequency of a trait.
   The age-frequency spectrum is defined as a two-dimensional array whose
   (i, k) element is the expected number of distinct cultural traits
   introduced k generations ago and now carried by i individuals in a
   sample of a particular size n. Numerical calculations reveal that the
   age-frequency spectrum and related metrics undergo a critical transition
   from a phase with a moderate number of young, rare traits to a phase
   with numerous very old, common traits when the expected number of
   cultural parents per individual exceeds one. It is shown that M+ and M-
   converge to branching or deterministic processes, depending on the way
   population size tends to infinity, and these limiting processes bear
   some duality relationships. The critical behavior of the original
   processes M+ and M- is explained in terms of a phase transition of the
   branching processes. Using the results of the limiting processes in
   combination, we derive analytical formulae that well approximate the
   age-frequency spectrum and also other metrics. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Title = {The coalescent of a sample from a binary branching process},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {122},
Number = {SI},
Pages = {30-35},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {At time 0, start a time-continuous binary branching process, where
   particles give birth to a single particle independently (at a possibly
   time-dependent rate) and die independently (at a possibly time-dependent
   and age-dependent rate). A particular case is the classical birth-death
   process. Stop this process at time T > 0. It is known that the tree
   spanned by the N tips alive at time T of the tree thus obtained (called
   a reduced tree or coalescent tree) is a coalescent point process (CPP),
   which basically means that the depths of interior nodes are independent
   and identically distributed (iid). Now select each of the N tips
   independently with probability y (Bernoulli sample). It is known that
   the tree generated by the selected tips, which we will call the
   Bernoulli sampled CPP, is again a CPP. Now instead, select exactly k
   tips uniformly at random among the N tips (a k-sample). We show that the
   tree generated by the selected tips is a mixture of Bernoulli sampled
   CPPs with the same parent CPP, over some explicit distribution of the
   sampling probability y. An immediate consequence is that the genealogy
   of a k-sample can be obtained by the realization of k random variables,
   first the random sampling probability Y and then the k - 1 node depths
   which are iid conditional on Y = y. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Inc.},

Title = {Sex allocation and the emergence of helping in cooperatively breeding
   species},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {104},
Pages = {1-9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {In cooperative breeding systems individuals invest in the reproductive
   success of others. In this paper, we study the emergence of cooperative
   breeding systems in which reproductively active breeders receive
   investment from reproductively non-active helpers. Our goal is to
   understand how the division of an investment between male and female
   components of breeder fitness (i.e. the helper sex-allocation strategy)
   influences the emergence of cooperative breeding itself. Using
   mathematical models, we arrive at expressions for the inclusive-fitness
   advantage of helpful behaviour that generalize previous work. These
   expressions assume an ecologically stable environment, and that breeders
   make evolutionarily stable sex-allocation decisions. We find that, when
   breeders are extremely resource limited, the sex-allocation strategy
   used by a helper can be a key determinant in the success of helpful
   alleles. This finding, however, is restricted to cases in which helpers
   have access to intermediate levels of resources. Surprisingly, when
   helpers can make only a small investment in a recipient the division of
   the investment matters only very little to advantage of help. By
   contrast when resources are extremely abundant, we obtain the
   unsurprising result that the manner in which resources are allocated has
   little influence on the emergence of help. When breeders have access to
   intermediate levels of resources we find increasing relatedness can, in
   certain cases, inhibit the emergence of help. We also find that
   increasing the amount of resources available to a breeder can impede
   help as well. Both of these counter-intuitive results are mediated by
   evolutionary responses in breeder sex allocation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Title = {Adaptive behaviour and multiple equilibrium states in a predator-prey
   model},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {101},
Pages = {24-30},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {There is evidence that multiple stable equilibrium states are possible
   in real-life ecological systems. Phenomenological mathematical models
   which exhibit such properties can be constructed rather
   straightforwardly. For instance, for a predator-prey system this result
   can be achieved through the use of non-monotonic functional response for
   the predator. However, while formal formulation of such a model is not a
   problem, the biological justification for such functional responses and
   models is usually inconclusive.
   In this note, we explore a conjecture that a multitude of equilibrium
   states can be caused by an adaptation of animal behaviour to changes of
   environmental conditions. In order to verify this hypothesis, we
   consider a simple predator-prey model, which is a straightforward
   extension of the classic Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model. In this
   model, we made an intuitively transparent assumption that the prey can
   change a mode of behaviour in response to the pressure of predation,
   choosing either ``safe{''} of ``risky{''} (or ``business as usual{''})
   behaviour. In order to avoid a situation where one of the modes gives an
   absolute advantage, we introduce the concept of the ``cost of a
   policy{''} into the model. A simple conceptual two-dimensional
   predator-prey model, which is minimal with this property, and is not
   relying on odd functional responses, higher dimensionality or behaviour
   change for the predator, exhibits two stable co-existing equilibrium
   states with basins of attraction separated by a separatrix of a saddle
   point. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Pages = {46-48},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The concept of the average effect of an allele pervades much of
   evolutionary population genetics. In this context the average effect of
   an allele is often considered as the main component of the ``fitness''
   of that allele. It is widely believed that, if this fitness component
   for an allele is positive, then the frequency of this allele will
   increase, at least for one generation in discrete-time models. In this
   note we show that this is not necessarily the case since the average
   effect of an allele on fitness may be different from its marginal
   additive fitness even in a one-locus setting in non-random-mating
   populations. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Metacommunities, fitness and gradual evolution},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {142},
Pages = {12-35},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {We analyze the evolution of a multidimensional quantitative trait in a
   class-structured focal species interacting with other species in a wider
   metacommunity. The evolutionary dynamics in the focal species as well as
   the ecological dynamics of the whole metacommunity is described as a
   continuoustime process with birth, physiological development, dispersal,
   and death given as rates that can depend on the state of the whole
   metacommunity. This can accommodate complex local community and global
   metacommunity environmental feedbacks owing to inter- and intra-specific
   interactions, as well as local environmental stochastic fluctuations.
   For the focal species, we derive a fitness measure for a mutant allele
   affecting class-specific trait expression. Using classical results from
   geometric singular perturbation theory, we provide a detailed proof that
   if the effect of the mutation on phenotypic expression is small
   ({''}weak selection{''}), the large system of dynamical equations needed
   to describe selection on the mutant allele in the metacommunity can be
   reduced to a single ordinary differential equation on the arithmetic
   mean mutant allele frequency that is of constant sign. This invariance
   on allele frequency entails the mutant either dies out or will
   out-compete the ancestral resident (or wild) type. Moreover, the
   directional selection coefficient driving arithmetic mean allele
   frequency can be expressed as an inclusive fitness effect calculated
   from the resident metacommunity alone, and depends, as expected, on
   individual fitness differentials, relatedness, and reproductive values.
   This formalizes the Darwinian process of gradual evolution driven by
   random mutation and natural selection in spatially and physiologically
   class-structured metacommunities. (C) 2021 The Author( s). Published by

Title = {The spatial Muller's ratchet: Surfing of deleterious mutations during
   range expansion},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {135},
Pages = {19-31},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {During a range expansion, deleterious mutations can ``surf'' on the
   colonization front. The resultant decrease in fitness is known as
   expansion load. An Allee effect is known to reduce the loss of genetic
   diversity of expanding populations, by changing the nature of the
   expansion from ``pulled{''}to ``pushed{''}. We study the impact of an
   Allee effect on the formation of an expansion load with a new model, in
   which individuals have the genetic structure of a Muller's ratchet. A
   key feature of Muller's ratchet is that the population fatally
   accumulates deleterious mutations due to the stochastic loss of the
   fittest individuals, an event called a click of the ratchet. We observe
   fast clicks of the ratchet at the colonization front owing to small
   population size, followed by a slow fitness recovery due to migration of
   fit individuals from the bulk of the population, leading to a transient
   expansion load. For large population size, we are able to derive
   quantitative features of the expansion wave, such as the wave speed and
   the frequency of individuals carrying a given number of mutations. Using
   simulations, we show that the presence of an Allee effect reduces the
   rate at which clicks occur at the front, and thus reduces the expansion
   load. (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Evolution of transmission modifiers under frequency-dependent selection
   and transmission in constant or fluctuating environments},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {135},
Pages = {56-63},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Although the Reduction Principle for rates of mutation, migration, and
   recombination has been proved for large populations under constant
   selection, the fate of modifiers of these evolutionary forces under
   frequency-dependent or fluctuating selection is, in general, less well
   understood. Here we study modifiers of transmission, which include
   modifiers of mutation and oblique cultural transmission, under
   frequency-dependent and cyclically fluctuating selection, and develop
   models for which the Reduction Principle fails. We show that whether
   increased rates of transmission can evolve from an equilibrium at which
   there is zero transmission (for example, no mutation) depends on the
   number of alleles among which transmission is occurring. In addition,
   properties of the null-transmission state are clarified. (c) 2020 The

Title = {Drivers of diversity in individual life courses: Sensitivity of the
   population entropy of a Markov chain},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {133},
Pages = {159-167},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Individuals differ in their life courses, but how this diversity is
   generated, how it has evolved and how it is maintained is less
   understood. However, this understanding is crucial to comprehend
   evolutionary and ecological population dynamics. In structured
   populations, individual life courses represent sequences of stages that
   end in death. These life course trajectories or sequences can be
   described by a Markov chain and individuals diversify over the course of
   their lives by transitioning through diverse discrete stages. The rate
   at which stage sequences diversify with age can be quantified by the
   population entropy of a Markov chain. Here, we derive sensitivities of
   the population entropy of a Markov chain to identify which stage
   transitions generate - or contribute - most to diversification in stage
   sequences, i.e. life courses. We then use these sensitivities to reveal
   potential selective forces on the dynamics of life courses. To do so we
   correlated the sensitivity of each matrix element (stage transition)
   with respect to the population entropy, to its sensitivity with respect
   to fitness lambda, the population growth rate. Positive correlation
   between the two sensitivities would suggest that the stage transitions
   that selection has acted most strongly on (high sensitivities with
   respect to lambda) are also those that contributed most to the
   diversification of life courses. Using an illustrative example on a
   seabird population, the Thick-billed Murres on Coats Island, that is
   structured by reproductive stages, we show that the most influential
   stage transitions for diversification of life courses are not correlated
   with the most influential transitions for population growth. Our finding
   suggests that observed diversification in life courses is neutral rather
   than adaptive, note this does not imply that the life histories
   themselves are not adaptive. We are at an early stage of understanding
   how individual level dynamics shape ecological and evolutionary
   dynamics, and many discoveries await. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {Selection is commonly described by assigning constant relative fitness
   values to genotypes. Yet population density is often regulated by
   crowding. Relative fitness may then depend on density, and selection can
   change density when it acts on a density-regulating trait. When strong
   density-dependent selection acts on a density-regulating trait,
   selection is no longer describable by density-independent relative
   fitnesses, even in demographically stable populations. These conditions
   are met in most previous models of density-dependent selection (e.g.
   ``K-selection{''} in the logistic and Lotka-Volterra models), suggesting
   that density-independent relative fitnesses must be replaced with more
   ecologically explicit absolute fitnesses unless selection is weak. Here
   we show that density-independent relative fitnesses can also accurately
   describe strong density-dependent selection under some conditions. We
   develop a novel model of density-regulated population growth with three
   ecologically intuitive traits: fecundity, mortality, and competitive
   ability. Our model, unlike the logistic or Lotka-Volterra, incorporates
   a density-dependent juvenile ``reproductive excess{''}, which largely
   decouples density-dependent selection from the regulation of density. We
   find that density-independent relative fitnesses accurately describe
   strong selection acting on any one trait, even fecundity, which is both
   density-regulating and subject to density-dependent selection.
   Pleiotropic interactions between these traits recover the familiar
   K-selection behavior. In such cases, or when the population is
   maintained far from demographic equilibrium, our model offers a possible
   alternative to relative fitness. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {The evolution of generalized reciprocity in social interaction networks},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {104},
Pages = {17-25},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Generalized reciprocity has been proposed as a mechanism for enabling
   continued cooperation between unrelated individuals. It can be described
   by the simple rule ``help somebody if you received help from
   someone{''}, and as it does not require individual recognition, complex
   cognition or extended memory capacities, it has the potential to explain
   cooperation in a large number of organisms. In a panmictic population
   this mechanism is vulnerable to defection by individuals who readily
   accept help but do not help themselves. Here, I investigate to what
   extent the limitation of social interactions to a social neighborhood
   can lead to conditions that favor generalized reciprocity in the absence
   of population structuring. It can be shown that cooperation is likely to
   evolve if one assumes certain sparse interaction graphs, if strategies
   are discrete, and if spontaneous helping and reciprocating are
   independently inherited. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Volume = {102},
Pages = {3-15},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In genealogies of genes sampled from structured populations, lineages
   coalesce at rates dependent on the states of the lineages. For migration
   and coalescence events occurring on comparable time scales, for example,
   only lineages residing in the same deme of a geographically subdivided
   population can have descended from a common ancestor in the immediately
   preceding generation. Here, we explore aspects of genealogical structure
   in a population comprising two demes, between which migration may occur.
   We use generating functions to obtain exact densities and moments of
   coalescence time, number of mutations, total tree length, and age of the
   most recent common ancestor of the sample. We describe qualitative
   features of the distribution of gene genealogies, including factors that
   influence the geographical location of the most recent common ancestor
   and departures of the distribution of internode lengths from
   exponential. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Age-and time-dependent model of the prevalence of non-communicable
   diseases and application to dementia in Germany},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {92},
Pages = {62-68},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {derive a partial differential equation (PDE) that models the
   age-specific prevalence of a disease as a function of the incidence,
   remission and mortality rates. The main focus is on non-communicable
   diseases (NCDs), although the PDE is not restricted to NCDs. As an
   application of the PDE, the number of persons with dementia in Germany
   until the year 2050 is estimated based on German incidence data and
   official population projections. Uncertainty is treated by different
   scenarios about life expectancy, number of migrants, prevalence of the
   disease in migrants, and scenarios about the future incidence, and
   mortality of demented persons. Life expectancy and incidence of dementia
   have the strongest impact on the future number of persons with dementia.
   In nearly all scenarios, our estimated case numbers exceed former
   estimates. Furthermore, we use an example to show that the PDE method
   yields more accurate results than a common alternative approach. (C)

Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {89},
Pages = {12-23},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {In this paper, with the methods of adaptive dynamics and critical
   function analysis, we investigate the evolutionary branching phenomenon
   of predator species. We assume that both the prey and predators are
   density-dependent and the predator's attack ability can adaptively
   evolve, but this has a cost in terms of its death rate. First, we
   identify the general properties of trade-off relationships that allow
   for a continuously stable strategy and evolutionary branching in the
   predator strategy. It is found that if the trade-off curve is weakly
   concave near the singular strategy, then the singular strategy may be an
   evolutionary branching point. Second, we find that after the branching
   has occurred in the predator strategy, if the trade-off curve is
   convex-concave-convex, the predator species will eventually evolve into
   two different types, which can stably coexist on the much longer
   evolutionary timescale and no further branching is possible. Crown

Title = {The influence of demographic stochasticity on evolutionary dynamics and
   stability},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {88},
Pages = {47-56},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {We derive the frequency-dependent selection coefficient caused by
   ``demographic{''} stochasticity resulting from the random sampling of
   opponents an individual faces during behavioral ``contests{''} with
   other individuals. The mean, variance, and higher moments of fitness all
   influence the direction and strength of selection. A frequency-dependent
   trait can be stable when an individual's fitness depends upon an
   infinite number of contests with other individuals and unstable when it
   depends upon a finite number of contests. Conversely, unstable
   equilibria for an infinite number of contests can be stable when there
   is a finite number of contests. At stable equilibria for a finite number
   of contests, higher moments of fitness can outweigh the joint influence
   of the first two moments so that natural selection favors
   ``within-generation{''} or developmental-trait variation (also known as
   phenotypic plasticity) contrary to the claim that natural selection
   always acts against such variation. We use second-moment estimates of
   the fitness functions in a diffusion approximation to compute fixation
   probabilities of competing strategies. These estimates are shown to be
   qualitatively consistent with those derived from simulations when
   population sizes are sufficiently large to ignore the contribution of
   higher-moment terms. We also show that explicit solutions to the
   diffusion approximation only exist for pair-wise interactions that lead
   to positive frequency-dependent selection. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All

Title = {Resource transfers and evolution: Helpful offspring and sex allocation},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {83},
Pages = {64-81},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In some vertebrates, offspring help their parents produce additional
   offspring. Often individuals of one sex are more likely to become
   ``helpers at the nest{''}. We analyze how such sex-biased offspring
   helping can influence sex-ratio evolution. It is essential to account
   for age-structure because the sex ratios of early broods influence how
   much help is available for later broods; previous authors have not
   correctly accounted for this fact. When each female produces the same
   sex ratio in all broods (as assumed in all previous analyses of
   sex-biased helping), the optimal investment strategy is biased towards
   the more-helpful sex. When a female has facultative control over the sex
   ratio in each brood and each helper of a given sex increases the
   resource available for offspring production by a fixed amount, the
   optimal strategy is to produce only the more-helpful sex in early broods
   and only the less-helpful sex in later broods. When there are nonlinear
   returns from helping, i.e., each helper increases the amount of resource
   available for reproduction by an amount dependent upon the number of
   helpers, the optimal strategy is to maximize resource accrual from
   helping in early broods (which may involve the production of both sexes)
   and then switch to the exclusive production of the less-helpful sex in
   later broods. The population sex ratio is biased towards the
   more-helpful sex regardless of whether the sex ratio is fixed or
   age-dependent. When fitness returns from helping exhibit environmental
   patchiness, females are selected to produce only males on some patches
   and only females on others, and the population sex ratio may be biased
   in either direction. We discuss our results in light of empirical
   information on offspring helping, and we show via meta-analysis that
   there is no support for the claim of Griffin et al. {[}Griffin, AS.,
   Sheldon, B.C., West, S.A., 2005. Cooperative breeders adjust offspring
   sex ratios to produce helpful helpers. Amer. Nat. 166,628-632] that
   parents produce more of the helpful sex when that sex is rare or absent.

Title = {An almost infinite sites model},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {160},
Pages = {49-61},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Motivation: A main challenge in molecular evolution is to find
   computationally efficient mutation models with flexible assumptions that
   properly reflect genetic variation. The infinite sites model assumes
   that each mutation event occurs at a site never previously mutant, i.e.
   it does not allow recurrent mutations. This is reasonable for low
   mutation rates and makes statistical inference much more tractable.
   However, recurrent mutations are common enough to be observable from
   genetic variation data, even in species with low per-site mutation rates
   such as humans. The finite sites model on the other hand allows for
   recurrent mutations but is computationally unfeasible to work with in
   most cases. In this work, we bridge these two approaches by developing a
   novel molecular evolution model, the almost infinite sites model, that
   both admits recurrent mutations and is tractable. We provide a recursive
   characterization of the likelihood of our proposed model under complete
   linkage and outline a parsimonious approximation scheme for computing
   it. Results: We show the usefulness of our model in simulated and human
   mitochondrial data. Our results show that the AISM, in combination with
   a constraint on the total number of mutation events, can recover
   accurate approximations to the maximum likelihood estimator of the
   mutation rate. Availability and implementation: An implementation of our
   model is freely available along with code for reproducing our
   computational experiments at

Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {151},
Pages = {28-43},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This work presents a population genetic model of evolution, which
   includes haploid selection, mutation, recombination, and drift. The
   mutation-selection equilibrium can be expressed exactly in closed form
   for arbitrary fitness functions without resorting to diffusion
   approximations. Tractability is achieved by generating new offspring
   using n-parent rather than 2-parent recombination. While this enforces
   linkage equilibrium among offspring, it allows analysis of the whole
   population under linkage disequilibrium. We derive a general and exact
   relationship between fitness fluctuations and response to selection. Our
   assumptions allow analytical calculation of the stationary distribution
   of the model for a variety of non-trivial fitness functions. These
   results allow us to speak to genetic architecture, i.e., what stationary
   distributions result from different fitness functions. This paper
   presents methods for exactly deriving stationary states for finite and
   infinite populations. This method can be applied to many fitness
   functions, and we give exact calculations for four of these. These
   results allow us to investigate metastability, tradeoffs between fitness
   functions, and even consider error-correcting codes. \& COPY; 2023 The

Title = {Coevolution fails to maintain genetic variation in a host-parasite model
   with constant finite population size},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {137},
Pages = {10-21},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Coevolutionary negative frequency-dependent selection has been
   hypothesized to maintain genetic variation in host and parasites.
   Despite the extensive literature pertaining to host-parasite
   coevolution, the temporal dynamics of genetic variation have not been
   examined in a matching-alleles model (MAM) with a finite population size
   relative to the expectation under neutral genetic drift alone. The
   dynamics of the MA coevolution in an infinite population, in fact,
   suggests that genetic variation in these coevolving populations behaves
   neutrally. By comparing host heterozygosity to the expectation in a
   single-species model of neutral genetic drift we find that while this is
   also largely true in finite populations two additional phenomena arise.
   First, reciprocal natural selection acting on stochastic perturbations
   in host and pathogen allele frequencies results in a slight increase or
   decrease in genetic variation depending on the parameter conditions.
   Second, following the fixation of an allele in the parasite, selection
   in the MAM becomes directional, which then rapidly erodes genetic
   variation in the host. Hence, rather than maintain it, we find that, on
   average, matching-alleles coevolution depletes genetic variation. (c)

Title = {Unstable population dynamics in obligate co-operators},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {136},
Pages = {1-11},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Cooperation significantly impacts a species' population dynamics as
   individuals choose others to associate with based upon fitness
   opportunities. Models of these dynamics typically assume that
   individuals can freely move between groups. Such an assumption works
   well for facultative cooperators (e.g. flocking birds, schooling fish,
   and swarming locusts) but less so for obligate co-operators (e.g.
   canids, cetaceans, and primates). With obligate co-operators, the
   fitness consequences from associations are stronger compared to
   facultative co-operators. Consequently, individuals within a group
   should be more discerning and selective over their associations,
   rejecting new members and even removing current members. Incorporating
   such aspects into population models may better reflect obligately
   cooperative species. In this paper, we create and analyze a model of the
   population dynamics of obligate co-operators. In our model, a behavioral
   game determines within-group population dynamics that then spill over
   into between-group dynamics. Our analysis shows that group number
   increases when population dynamics are stable, but additional groups
   lead to unstable population dynamics and an eventual collapse of group
   numbers. Using a more general analysis, we identify a fundamental
   mismatch between the stability of the behavioral dynamics and the
   stability of the population dynamics. When one is stable, the other is
   not. Our results suggest that group turnover may be inherent to the
   population dynamics of obligate co-operators. The instability arises
   from a non-chaotic deterministic process, and such dynamics should be
   predictable and testable. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Cultural processes, as well as the selection pressures experienced by
   individuals in a population over time and space, are fundamentally
   stochastic. Phenotypic variability, together with imperfect phenotypic
   transmission between parents and offspring, has been previously shown to
   play an important role in evolutionary rescue and (epi)genetic
   adaptation of populations to fluctuating temporal environmental
   pressures. This type of evolutionary bet-hedging does not confer a
   direct benefit to a single individual, but can instead increase the
   adaptability of the whole lineage.
   Here we develop a population-genetic model to explore cultural response
   strategies to temporally changing selection, as well as the role of
   local population structure, as exemplified by heterogeneity in the
   contact network between individuals, in shaping evolutionary dynamics.
   We use this model to study the evolutionary advantage of cultural
   bet-hedging, modeling the evolution of a variable cultural trait
   starting from one copy in a population of individuals with a fixed
   cultural strategy. We find that the probability of fixation of a
   cultural bet-hedger is a non-monotonic function of the probability of
   cultural memory between generations. Moreover, this probability
   increases for networks of higher mean degree but decreases with
   increasing heterogeneity of the contact network, tilting the balance of
   forces toward drift and against selection.
   These results shed light on the interplay of temporal and spatial
   stochasticity in shaping cultural evolutionary dynamics and suggest that
   partly-heritable cultural phenotypic variability may constitute an
   important evolutionary bet-hedging strategy in response to changing
   selection pressures. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {An empirical approach to demographic inference with genomic data},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {127},
Pages = {91-101},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Inference with population genetic data usually treats the population
   pedigree as a nuisance parameter, the unobserved product of a past
   history of random mating. However, the history of genetic relationships
   in a given population is a fixed, unobserved object, and so an
   alternative approach is to treat this network of relationships as a
   complex object we wish to learn about, by observing how genomes have
   been noisily passed down through it. This paper explores this point of
   view, showing how to translate questions about population genetic data
   into calculations with a Poisson process of mutations on all ancestral
   genomes. This method is applied to give a robust interpretation to the
   f(4) statistic used to identify admixture, and to design a new statistic
   that measures covariances in mean times to most recent common ancestor
   between two pairs of sequences. The method more generally interprets
   population genetic statistics in terms of sums of specific functions
   over ancestral genomes, thereby providing concrete, broadly
   interpretable interpretations for these statistics. This provides a
   method for describing demographic history without simplified demographic
   models. More generally, it brings into focus the population pedigree,
   which is averaged over in model-based demographic inference. (C) 2019

Title = {PRDM9 and the evolution of recombination hotspots},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {126},
Pages = {19-32},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Recombination in mammals is not uniformly distributed along the
   chromosome but concentrated in small regions known as recombination
   hotspots. Recombination starts with the double-strand break of a
   chromosomal sequence and results in the transmission of the sequence
   that does not break (preventing recombination) more often than the
   sequence that breaks (allowing recombination). Thus recombination itself
   renders individual recombination hotspots inactive and over time should
   drive them to extinction in the genome. Empirical evidence shows that
   individual recombination hotspots die but, far from being driven to
   extinction, they are abundant in the genome: a contradiction referred to
   as the Recombination Hotspot Paradox. What saves recombination hotspots
   from extinction? The current answer relies in the formation of new
   recombination hotspots in new genomic sites driven by viability
   selection in favor of recombination. Here we formulate a population
   genetics model that incorporates the molecular mechanism initiating
   recombination in mammals (PRDM9-like genes), to provide an alternative
   solution to the paradox. We find that weak selection allows individual
   recombination hotspots to become inactive (die) while saving them from
   extinction in the genome by driving their re-activation (resurrection).
   Our model shows that when selection for recombination is weak, the
   introduction of rare variants causes recombination sites to oscillate
   between hot and cold phenotypes with a recombination hotspot dying only
   to come back. Counter-intuitively, we find that low viability selection
   leaves a hard selective sweep signature in the genome, with the
   selective sweep at the recombination hotspot being the hardest when
   viability selection is the lowest. Our model can help to understand the
   rapid evolution of PRDM9, the co-existence of two types of hotspots, the
   life expectancy of hotspots, and the volatility of the recombinational
   landscape (with hotspots rarely being shared between closely related
   species). (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Survival probabilities at spherical frontiers},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {102},
Pages = {26-39},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Motivated by tumor growth and spatial population genetics, we study the
   interplay between evolutionary and spatial dynamics at the surfaces of
   three-dimensional, spherical range expansions. We consider range
   expansion radii that grow with an arbitrary power-law in time: R(t) =
   R-0(1 + t/t{*})(Theta), where Theta is a growth exponent, R-0 is the
   initial radius, and t{*} is a characteristic time for the growth, to be
   affected by the inflating geometry. We vary the parameters t{*} and
   Theta to capture a variety of possible growth regimes. Guided by recent
   results for two-dimensional inflating range expansions, we identify key
   dimensionless parameters that describe the survival probability of a
   mutant cell with a small selective advantage arising at the population
   frontier. Using analytical techniques, we calculate this probability for
   arbitrary Theta. We compare our results to simulations of linearly
   inflating expansions (Theta = 1 spherical
   Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piscunov waves) and treadmilling populations
   (Theta = 0, with cells in the interior removed by apoptosis or a similar
   process). We find that mutations at linearly inflating fronts have
   survival probabilities enhanced by factors of 100 or more relative to
   mutations at treadmilling population frontiers. We also discuss the
   special properties of ``marginally inflating{''} (Theta = 1/2)
   expansions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Phenotype adjustment promotes adaptive evolution in a game without
   conflict},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {102},
Pages = {16-25},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Organisms may adjust their phenotypes in response to social and physical
   environments. Such phenotypic plasticity is known to help or retard
   adaptive evolution. Here, we study the evolutionary outcomes of adaptive
   phenotypic plasticity in an evolutionary game involving two players who
   have no conflicts of interest. A possible example is the growth and sex
   allocation of a lifelong pair of shrimps entrapped in the body of a
   sponge. We consider random pair forrnation, the limitation of total
   resources for growth, and the needs of male investment to fertilize eggs
   laid by the partner. We compare the following three different
   evolutionary dynamics: (1) No adjustment: each individual develops a
   phenotype specified by its own genotype; (2) One-player adjustment: the
   phenotype of the first player is specified by its own genotype, and the
   second player chooses the phenotype that maximizes its own fitness; (3)
   Two-player adjustment: the first player exhibits an initial phenotype
   specified by its own genotype, the second player chooses a phenotype
   given that of the first player, and finally, the first player readjusts
   its phenotype given that of the second player. We demonstrate that both
   one-player and two-player adjustments evolve to achieve maximum fitness.
   In contrast, the dynamics without adjustment fails in some cases to
   evolve outcomes with the highest fitness. For an intermediate range of
   male cost, the evolution of no adjustment realizes two hermaphrodites
   with equal size, whereas the one-player and two-player adjustments
   realize a small male and a large female. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All

Title = {Superinfection reconciles host-parasite association and cross-species
   transmission},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {90},
Pages = {129-134},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Parasites are either dedicated to a narrow host range, or capable of
   exploiting a wide host range. Understanding how host ranges are
   determined is very important for public health, as well as wildlife,
   plant, livestock and agricultural diseases. Our current understanding of
   host-parasite associations hinges on co-evolution, which assumes evolved
   host preferences (host specialization) of the parasite. Despite the
   explanatory power of this framework, we have only a vague understanding
   of why many parasites routinely cross the host species' barrier. Here we
   introduce a simple model demonstrating how superinfection (in a
   heterogeneous community) can promote host-parasite association.
   Strikingly, the model illustrates that strong host-parasite association
   occurs in the absence of host specialization, while still permitting
   cross-species transmission. For decades, host specialization has been
   foundational in explaining the maintenance of distinct parasites/strains
   in host species. We argue that host specializations may be exaggerated,
   and can occur as a byproduct (not necessarily the cause) of
   host-parasite associations. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Volume = {88},
Pages = {94-100},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Taylor's law (TL), a widely verified empirical relationship in ecology,
   states that the variance of population density is approximately a
   power-law function of mean density. The growth-rate theorem (GR) states
   that, in a subdivided population, the rate of change of the overall
   growth rate is proportional to the variance of the subpopulations'
   growth rates. We show that continuous-time exponential change implies GR
   at every time and, asymptotically for large time, TL with power-law
   exponent 2. We also show why diverse population-dynamic models predict
   TL in the limit of large time by identifying simple features these
   models share: If the mean population density and the variance of
   population density are (exactly or asymptotically) non-constant
   exponential functions of a parameter (e.g., time), then the variance of
   density is (exactly or asymptotically) a power-law function of mean
   density. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Joint evolution of altruistic cooperation and dispersal in a
   metapopulation of small local populations},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {85},
Pages = {12-19},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {We investigate the joint evolution of public goods cooperation and
   dispersal in a metapopulation model with small local populations.
   Altruistic cooperation can evolve due to assortment and kin selection,
   and dispersal can evolve because of demographic stochasticity,
   catastrophes and kin selection. Metapopulation structures resulting in
   assortment have been shown to make selection for cooperation possible.
   But how does dispersal affect cooperation and vice versa, when both are
   allowed to evolve as continuous traits? We found four qualitatively
   different evolutionary outcomes. (1) Monomorphic evolution to full
   defection with positive dispersal. (2) Monomorphic evolution to an
   evolutionarily stable state with positive cooperation and dispersal. In
   this case, parameter changes selecting for increased cooperation
   typically also select for increased dispersal. (3) Evolutionary
   branching can,result in the evolutionarily stable coexistence of
   defectors and cooperators. Although defectors could be expected to
   disperse more than cooperators, here we show that the opposite case is
   also possible: Defectors tend to disperse less than cooperators when the
   total amount of cooperation in the dimorphic population is low enough.
   (4) Selection for too low cooperation can cause the extinction of the
   evolving population. For moderate catastrophe rates dispersal needs to
   be initially very frequent for evolutionary suicide to occur. Although
   selection for less dispersal in principle could prevent such
   evolutionary suicide, in most cases this rescuing effect is not
   sufficient, because selection in the cooperation trait is typically much
   stronger. If the catastrophe rate is large enough, a part of the
   boundary of viability can be evolutionarily attracting with respect to
   both strategy components, in which case evolutionary suicide is expected
   from all initial conditions. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

   tree properties},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {143},
Pages = {1-13},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Gene genealogies are frequently studied by measuring properties such as
   their height (H), length (L), sum of external branches (E), sum of
   internal branches (I), and mean of their two basal branches (B), and the
   coalescence times that contribute to the other genealogical features
   (T). These tree properties and their relationships can provide insight
   into the effects of population-genetic processes on genealogies and
   genetic sequences. Here, under the coalescent model, we study the 15
   correlations among pairs of features of genealogical trees: Hn, Ln, En,
   In, Bn, and Tk for a sample of size n, with 2 < k < n. We report high
   correlations among Hn, Ln, In, and Bn, with all pairwise correlations of
   these quantities having values greater than or equal to 6{[}6 zeta (3) +
   6 - pi 2]/(pi 18 + 9 pi 2 - pi 4) R\% 0.84930 in the limit as n -> oo,
   where zeta is the Riemann zeta function. Although En has expectation 2
   for all n and Hn has expectation 2 in the n -> oo limit, their limiting
   correlation is 0. The results contribute toward understanding features
   of the shapes of coalescent trees. (c) 2021 The Author(s). Published by

Title = {A model of the burglar alarm hypothesis of prey alarm calls},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {141},
Pages = {1-13},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {When approached by a predator many prey species will emit an ``alarm
   call{''} as a form of anti-predator behavior. One hypothesis for the
   function of alarm calls is the ``burglar alarm{''} hypothesis whereby
   upon attack, a prey renders itself dangerous to a predator by generating
   an alarm call that attracts a predator at higher trophic levels in the
   food chain; that is, attracts a predator to the prey's own predator.
   This paper concerns a model incorporating a mechanism to test the
   burglar alarm hypothesis. We prove in one space dimension global
   existence, of positive bounded classical solutions, and establish
   existence of non-constant equilibrium solutions and assess their
   stability. We provide some representative numerical simulations to
   emphasize the nature of pattern formation for this model and demonstrate
   the benefit achieved by a signal inducing prey species under the burglar
   alarm hypothesis. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Volume = {137},

Abstract = {The reproductive number R (or R-0, the initial reproductive number in an
   immune-naive population) has long been successfully used to predict the
   likelihood of pathogen invasion, to gauge the potential severity of an
   epidemic, and to set policy around interventions. However, often ignored
   complexities have generated confusion around use of the metric. This is
   particularly apparent with the emergent pandemic virus SARS-CoV-2, the
   causative agent of COVID-19. We address some misconceptions about the
   predictive ability of the reproductive number, focusing on how it
   changes over time, varies over space, and relates to epidemic size by
   referencing the mathematical definition of R and examples from the
   current pandemic. We hope that a better appreciation of the uses,
   nuances, and limitations of R and R-0 facilitates a better understanding
   of epidemic spread, epidemic severity, and the effects of interventions
   in the context of SARS-CoV-2. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {The Wright-Fisher model with efficiency},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {132},
Pages = {33-46},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {In this article, we propose a Wright-Fisher model with two types of
   individuals: the inefficient individuals, those who need more resources
   to reproduce and can have a higher growth rate, and the efficient
   individuals. In this model, the total amount of resource N is fixed, and
   the population size varies randomly depending on the number of efficient
   individuals. We show that, as N increases, the frequency process of
   efficient individuals converges to a diffusion which is a generalization
   of the Wright-Fisher diffusion with selection. The genealogy of this
   model is given by a branching- coalescing process that we call the
   Ancestral Selection/Efficiency Graph, and that is an extension of the
   Ancestral Selection Graph (Krone and Neuhauser, 1997a,b). The main
   contribution of this paper is that, in evolving populations,
   inefficiency can arise as a promoter of selective advantage and not
   necessarily as a trade-off. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {In contrast with autosomes, lineages of sex chromosomes reside for
   different amounts of time in males and females, and this transmission
   asymmetry makes them hotspots for sexual conflict. Similarly, the
   maternal inheritance of the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) means that
   mutations that are beneficial in females can spread in a population even
   if they are deleterious in males, a form of sexual conflict known as
   Mother's Curse. While both Mother's Curse and sex chromosome induced
   sexual conflict have been well studied on their own, the interaction
   between mitochondrial genes and genes on sex chromosomes is poorly
   understood. Here, we use analytical models and computer simulations to
   perform a comprehensive examination of how transmission asymmetries of
   nuclear, mitochondrial, and sex chromosome-linked genes may both cause
   and resolve sexual conflicts. For example, the accumulation of
   male-biased Mother's Curse mtDNA mutations will lead to selection in
   males for compensatory nuclear modifier loci that alleviate the effect.
   We show how the Y chromosome, being strictly paternally transmitted
   provides a particularly safe harbor for such modifiers. This analytical
   framework also allows us to discover a novel kind of sexual conflict, by
   which Y chromosome-autosome epistasis may result in the spread of male
   beneficial but female deleterious mutations in a population. We christen
   this phenomenon Father's Curse. Extending this analytical framework to
   ZW sex chromosome systems, where males are the heterogametic sex, we
   also show how W-autosome epistasis can lead to a novel kind of nuclear
   Mother's Curse. Overall, this study provides a comprehensive framework
   to understand how genetic transmission asymmetries may both cause and
   resolve sexual conflicts. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Stationary distribution of the linkage disequilibrium coefficient
   <i>r</i><SUP>2</SUP>},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {128},
Pages = {19-26},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The linkage disequilibrium coefficient r(2) is a measure of statistical
   dependence of the alleles possessed by an individual at different
   genetic loci. It is widely used in association studies to search for the
   locations of disease-causing genes on chromosomes. Most studies to date
   treat r(2) as a fixed property of two loci in a finite population, and
   investigate the sampling distribution of estimators due to the
   statistical sampling of individuals from the population. Here, we
   instead consider the distribution of r(2) itself under a process of
   genetic sampling through the generations. Using a classical two-locus
   model for genetic drift, mutation, and recombination, we investigate the
   probability density function of r(2) at stationarity. This density
   function provides a tool for inference on evolutionary parameters such
   as mutation and recombination rates. We reconstruct the approximate
   stationary density of r(2) by calculating a finite sequence of the
   distribution's moments and applying the maximum entropy principle. Our
   approach is based on the diffusion approximation, under which we
   demonstrate that for certain models in population genetics, moments of
   the stationary distribution can be obtained without knowing the
   probability distribution itself. To illustrate our approach, we show how
   the stationary probability density of r(2) can be used in a maximum
   likelihood framework to estimate mutation and recombination rates from
   sample data of r(2). (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {123},
Pages = {1-8},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Generation of variation may be detrimental in well-adapted populations
   evolving under constant selection. In a constant environment, genetic
   modifiers that reduce the rate at which variation is generated by
   processes such as mutation and migration, succeed. However, departures
   from this reduction principle have been demonstrated. Here we analyze a
   general model of evolution under constant selection where the rate at
   which variation is generated depends on the individual. We find that if
   a modifier allele increases the rate at which individuals of
   below-average fitness generate variation, then it will increase in
   frequency and increase the population mean fitness. This principle
   applies to phenomena such as stress-induced mutagenesis and
   condition-dependent dispersal, and exemplifies ``Necessity is the mother
   of genetic invention.{''} (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Title = {An efficient algorithm for generating the internal branches of a Kingman
   coalescent},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {122},
Number = {SI},
Pages = {57-66},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Coalescent simulations are a widely used approach for simulating sample
   genealogies, but can become computationally burdensome in large samples.
   Methods exist to analytically calculate a sample's expected frequency
   spectrum without simulating full genealogies. However, statistics that
   rely on the distribution of the length of internal coalescent branches,
   such as the probability that two mutations of equal size arose on the
   same genealogical branch, have previously required full coalescent
   simulations to estimate. Here, we present a sampling method capable of
   efficiently generating limited portions of sample genealogies using a
   series of analytic equations that give probabilities for the number,
   start, and end of internal branches conditional on the number of final
   samples they subtend. These equations are independent of the coalescent
   waiting times and need only be calculated a single time, lending
   themselves to efficient computation. We compare our method with full
   coalescent simulations to show the resulting distribution of branch
   lengths and summary statistics are equivalent, but that for many
   conditions our method is at least 10 times faster. (C) 2017 Elsevier

   humans, but indicate much cultural/behavioral variability over time and
   space. Thus, in modeling the replacement or assimilation of Neanderthals
   by modern humans, it is of interest to consider cultural dynamics and
   their relation to demographic change. The ecocultural framework for the
   competition between hominid species allows their carrying capacities to
   depend on some measure of the levels of culture they possess. In the
   present study both population densities and the densities of skilled
   individuals in Neanderthals and modern humans are spatially distributed
   and subject to change by spatial diffusion, ecological competition, and
   cultural transmission within each species. We analyze the resulting
   range expansions in terms of the demographic, ecological and cultural
   parameters that determine how the carrying capacities relate to the
   local densities of skilled individuals in each species. Of special
   interest is the case of cognitive and intrinsic-demographic equivalence
   of the two species. The range expansion dynamics may consist of multiple
   wave fronts of different speeds, each of which originates from a
   traveling wave solution. Properties of these traveling wave solutions
   are mathematically derived. Depending on the parameters, these traveling
   waves can result in replacement of Neanderthals by modern humans, or
   assimilation of the former by the latter. In both the replacement and
   assimilation scenarios, the first wave of intrusive modem humans is
   characterized by a low population density and a low density of skilled
   individuals, with implications for archaeological visibility. The first
   invasion is due to weak interspecific competition. A second wave of
   invasion may be induced by cultural differences between moderns and
   Neanderthals. Spatially and temporally extended coexistence of the two
   species, which would have facilitated the transfer of genes from
   Neanderthal into modern humans and vice versa, is observed in the
   traveling waves, except when niche overlap between the two species is
   extremely high. Archaeological findings on the spatial and temporal
   distributions of the Initial Upper Palaeolithic and the Early Upper
   Palaeolithic and of the coexistence of Neanderthals and modern humans
   are discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {We address the evolution of effective number of individuals under
   androdioecy and gynodioecy. We analyze dynamic models of autosomal
   modifiers of weak effect on sex expression. In our zygote control
   models, the sex expressed by a zygote depends on its own genotype, while
   in our maternal control models, it depends on the genotype of its
   maternal parent. Our analysis unifies full multi-dimensional local
   stability analysis with the Li-Price equation, which for all its
   heuristic appeal, describes evolutionary change over a single
   generation. We define a point in the neighborhood of a fixation state
   from which a single-generation step indicates the asymptotic behavior of
   the frequency of a modifier allele initiated at an arbitrary point near
   the fixation state. A concept of heritability appropriate for the
   evolutionary modification of sex emerges from the Li-Price framework. We
   incorporate our theoretical analysis into our previously-developed
   Bayesian inference framework to develop a new method for inferring the
   viability of gonochores (males or females) relative to hermaphrodites.
   Applying this approach to microsatellite data derived from natural
   populations of the gynodioecious plant Schiedea salicaria and the
   androdioecious killifish Kryptolebias marmoratus, we find that while
   female and hermaphrodite S. salicaria appear to have similar
   viabilities, male K. marmoratus appear to survive to reproductive age at
   less than half the rate of hermaphrodites. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All

Title = {Evolutionary dynamics of a quantitative trait in a finite asexual
   population},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {108},
Pages = {75-88},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {In finite populations, mutation limitation and genetic drift can hinder
   evolutionary diversification. We consider the evolution of a
   quantitative trait in an asexual population whose size can vary and
   depends explicitly on the trait. Previous work showed that evolutionary
   branching is certain ({''}deterministic branching{''}) above a threshold
   population size, but uncertain ({''}stochastic branching{''}) below it.
   Using the stationary distribution of the population's trait variance, we
   identify three qualitatively different sub domains of ``stochastic
   branching{''} and illustrate our results using a model of social
   evolution. We find that in very small populations, branching will almost
   never be observed; in intermediate populations, branching is
   intermittent, arising and disappearing over time; in larger populations,
   finally, branching is expected to occur and persist for substantial
   periods of time. Our study provides a clearer picture of the ecological
   conditions that facilitate the appearance and persistence of novel
   evolutionary lineages in the face of genetic drift. (C) 2015 Elsevier

   plant invasions},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {106},
Pages = {14-21},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {A new individual-based model is presented for investigating an important
   group of invasive plant species, from the genus Spartina, that threaten
   biodiversity in coastal and intertidal habitats around the world. The
   role of pollen limitation in influencing the early development of an
   invasion is explored in order to gain a greater understanding of the
   mechanistic basis for an apparent Allee effect (causal relationship
   between population size/density and mean individual fitness) observed in
   populations of invasive Spartina species: The model is used to explore
   how various factors such as atmospheric stability, wind direction/speed,
   pollen characteristics and spatial structure of the population affect
   the overall invasion dynamics and reproductive success. Comparisons were
   also made between invasive species of Spartina (S. alterniflora, S.
   anglica) and a non-invasive species (S. foliosa), showing a reduced
   Allee effect was associated with invasion success. Furthermore, the
   conclusions drawn here may give insights into some of the fundamental
   processes affecting the growth and population dynamics of other invasive
   wind-pollinated plants. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {A sequentially Markov conditional sampling distribution for structured
   populations with migration and recombination},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {87},
Pages = {51-61},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Conditional sampling distributions (CSDs), sometimes referred to as
   copying models, underlie numerous practical tools in population genomic
   analyses. Though an important application that has received much
   attention is the inference of population structure, the explicit
   exchange of migrants at specified rates has not hitherto been
   incorporated into the CSD in a principled framework. Recently, in the
   case of a single panmictic population, a sequentially Markov CSD has
   been developed as an accurate, efficient approximation to a principled
   CSD derived from the diffusion process dual to the coalescent with
   recombination. In this paper, the sequentially Markov CSD framework is
   extended to incorporate subdivided population structure, thus providing
   an efficiently computable CSD that admits a genealogical interpretation
   related to the structured coalescent with migration and recombination.
   As a concrete application, it is demonstrated empirically that the CSD
   developed here can be employed to yield accurate estimation of a wide
   range of migration rates. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Two success-biased social learning strategies},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {86},
Pages = {43-49},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {I compare the evolutionary dynamics of two success-biased social
   learning strategies, which, by definition, use the success of others to
   inform one's social learning decisions. The first, ``Compare Means{''},
   causes a learner to adopt cultural variants with highest mean payoff in
   her sample. The second, ``Imitate the Best{''}, causes a learner to
   imitate the single most successful individual in her sample. I summarize
   conditions under which each strategy performs well or poorly, and
   investigate their evolution via a gene-culture coevolutionary model.
   Despite the adaptive appeal of these strategies, both encounter
   conditions under which they systematically perform worse than simply
   imitating at random. Compare Means performs worst when the optimal
   cultural variant is usually at high frequency, while Imitate the Best
   performs worst when suboptimal variants sometimes produce high payoffs.
   The extent to which it is optimal to use success-biased social learning
   depends strongly on the payoff distributions and environmental
   conditions that human social learners face. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All

   the reproductive success of one type is larger than the other. The
   higher reproductive success may stem from either more frequent
   reproduction, or from larger numbers of offspring, and is encoded in a
   measure A for each of the two types. A-reproduction here means that a
   whole fraction of the population is replaced at a reproductive event.
   Our approach consists of constructing a A-asymmetric Moran model in
   which individuals of the two populations compete, rather than
   considering a Moran model for each population. Provided the measure are
   ordered stochastically, we can couple them. This allows us to construct
   the central object of this paper, the A-asymmetric - asymmetric
   ancestral selection graph, leading to a pathwise duality of the forward
   in time A-asymmetric Moran model with its ancestral process. We apply
   the ancestral selection graph in order to obtain scaling limits of the
   forward and backward processes, and note that the frequency process
   converges to the solution of an SDE with discontinuous paths. Finally,
   we derive a Griffiths representation for the generator of the SDE and
   use it to find a semi-explicit formula for the probability of fixation
   of the less beneficial of the two types.},

Title = {The best of both worlds: Combining population genetic and quantitative
   genetic models},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {148},
Pages = {49-75},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Numerous traits under migration-selection balance are shown to exhibit
   complex patterns of genetic architecture with large variance in effect
   sizes. However, the conditions under which such genetic architectures
   are stable have yet to be investigated, because studying the influence
   of a large number of small allelic effects on the maintenance of spatial
   polymorphism is mathematically challenging, due to the high complexity
   of the systems that arise. In particular, in the most simple case of a
   haploid population in a two-patch environment, while it is known from
   population genetics that polymorphism at a single major-effect locus is
   stable in the symmetric case, there exist no analytical predictions on
   how this polymorphism holds when a polygenic background also contributes
   to the trait. Here we propose to answer this question by introducing a
   new eco-evo methodology that allows us to take into account the combined
   contributions of a major-effect locus and of a quantitative background
   resulting from small-effect loci, where inheritance is encoded according
   to an extension to the infinitesimal model. In a regime of small
   variance contributed by the quantitative loci, we justify that traits
   are concentrated around the major alleles, according to a normal
   distribution, using new convex analysis arguments. This allows a
   reduction in the complexity of the system using a separation of time
   scales approach. We predict an undocumented phenomenon of loss of
   polymorphism at the major-effect locus despite strong selection for
   local adaptation, because the quantitative background slowly disrupts
   the rapidly established polymorphism at the major-effect locus, which is
   confirmed by individual-based simulations. Our study highlights how
   segregation of a quantitative background can greatly impact the dynamics
   of major-effect loci by provoking migrational meltdowns. We also provide
   a comprehensive toolbox designed to describe how to apply our method to
   more complex population genetic models.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Ancestral state reconstruction is one of the most important tasks in
   evolutionary biology. Conditions under which we can reliably reconstruct
   the ancestral state have been studied for both discrete and continuous
   traits. However, the connection between these results is unclear, and it
   seems that each model needs different conditions. In this work, we
   provide a unifying theory on the consistency of ancestral state
   reconstruction for various types of trait evolution models. Notably, we
   show that for a sequence of nested trees with bounded heights, the
   necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a consistent
   ancestral state reconstruction method under discrete models, the
   Brownian motion model, and the threshold model are equivalent. When tree
   heights are unbounded, we provide a simple counter-example to show that
   this equivalence is no longer valid.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {Success-biased social learning in a one-consumer, two-resource model},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {146},
Pages = {29-35},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Previous analyses have predicted that social learning should not evolve
   in a predator-prey system. Here we examine whether success-biased social
   learning, by which social learners copy successful demonstrators, allows
   social learning by foragers to evolve. We construct a one-predator,
   two-prey system in which foragers must learn how to feed on depletable
   prey populations in an environment where foraging information can be
   difficult to obtain individually. We analyze two models in which social
   learning is success-biased: in the first, individual learning does not
   depend on the resource dynamics, and in the second model it depends on
   the relative frequency of the resource. Unlike previous results, we find
   that social learning does not cause predators to over-harvest one type
   of prey over the other. Furthermore, increasing the probability of
   social learning increases the probability of learning a successful
   foraging behavior, especially when individually learned information
   tends to be inaccurate. Whereas social learning does not evolve among
   individual learners in the first model, the assumption of
   resource-dependent learning in the second model allows a mutant with an
   increased probability of social learning to spread through the forager
   population. (c) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc. This is

Abstract = {We study the effect of variability in payoffs on the evolution of

   well-mixed population. We show that an increase in the covariance
   between any two payoffs to D, or a decrease in the covariance between
   any two payoffs to C, increases the probability of ultimate fixation of
   C when represented once, and decreases the corresponding fixation
   probability for D. This is also the case with an increase in the
   covariance between any payoff to C and any payoff to D if and only if
   the sum of the numbers of C-players in the group associated with these
   payoffs is large enough compared to the group size. In classical social
   dilemmas with random cost and benefit for cooperation, the evolution of
   C is more likely to occur if the variances of the cost and benefit, as
   well as the group size, are small, while the covariance between cost and

Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {138},
Pages = {43-56},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Classical theory in population genetics includes derivation of the
   stationary distribution of allele frequencies under balance between
   selection, genetic drift, and mutation. Here we investigate the simplest
   generalization of these single locus models to quantitative genetics
   with many loci, assuming simple additive effects on a set of phenotypes
   and a linear approximation to the fitness function. Genetic effects and
   pleiotropy are simulated by a prescribed stochastic model. Our goal is
   to analyze the structure of the G-matrix at stasis when the model is not
   very close to being neutral. The smallest eigenvalue of the G-matrix is
   practically zero by Fisher's fundamental theorem for natural selection
   and the fitness function is approximately a linear function of the
   corresponding eigenvector. Evolution of genetic trade-offs is closely
   linked to the fitness function. If a single locus never codes for more
   than two traits, then additive genetic covariance between two phenotype
   components always has the opposite sign of the product of their
   coefficients in the fitness function under no mutation, a pattern that
   is likely to occur frequently also in more complex models. In our major
   examples only 1-2 percent of the loci are over-dominant for fitness, but
   they still account for practically all dominance variance in fitness as
   well as all contributions to the G-matrix. These analyses show that the
   structure of the G-matrix reveals important information about the
   contribution of different traits to fitness. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All

Title = {Multi-model inference of non-random mating from an information theoretic
   approach},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {131},
Pages = {38-53},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Non-random mating has a significant impact on the evolution of
   organisms. Here, I developed a modelling framework for discrete traits
   (with any number of phenotypes) to explore different models connecting
   the non-random mating causes (mate competition and/or mate choice) and
   their consequences (sexual selection and/or assortative mating).
   I derived the formulae for the maximum likelihood estimates of each
   model and used information criteria to perform multi-model inference.
   Simulation results showed a good performance of both model selection and
   parameter estimation. The methodology was applied to ecotypes data of
   the marine gastropod Littorina saxatilis from Galicia (Spain), to show
   that the mating pattern is better described by models with two
   parameters that involve both mate choice and competition, generating
   positive assortative mating plus female sexual selection. As far as I
   know, this is the first standardized methodology for model selection and
   multi-model inference of mating parameters for discrete traits. The
   advantages of this framework include the ability of setting up models
   from which the parameters connect causes, as mate competition and mate
   choice, with their outcome in the form of data patterns of sexual
   selection and assortative mating. For some models, the parameters may
   have a double effect i.e. they produce sexual selection and assortative
   mating, while for others there are separated parameters for one kind of
   pattern or another. From an empirical point of view, it is much easier
   to study patterns than processes and, for this reason, the causal
   mechanisms of sexual selection are not so well known as the patterns
   they produce. The goal of the present work is to propose a new tool that
   helps to distinguish among different alternative processes behind the
   observed mating pattern. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {An accurate approximation for the expected site frequency spectrum in a
   Galton-Watson process under an infinite sites mutation model},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {127},

Abstract = {If viruses or other pathogens infect a single host, the outcome of
   infection often hinges on the fate of the initial invaders. The initial
   basic reproduction number R-0, the expected number of cells infected by
   a single infected cell, helps determine whether the initial viruses can
   establish a successful beachhead. To determine R-0, the Kingman
   coalescent or continuous-time birth-and-death process can be used to
   infer the rate of exponential growth in an historical population. Given
   M sequences sampled in the present, the two models can make the
   inference from the site frequency spectrum (SFS), the count of mutations
   that appear in exactly k sequences (k = 1, 2, ... , M). In the case of
   viruses, however, if R-0 is large and an infected cell bursts while
   propagating virus, the two models are suspect, because they are
   Markovian with only binary branching. Accordingly, this article develops
   an approximation for the SFS of a discrete-time branching process with
   synchronous generations (i.e., a Galton-Watson process). When evaluated
   in simulations with an asynchronous, non-Markovian model (a
   Bellman-Harris process) with parameters intended to mimic the bursting
   viral reproduction of HIV, the approximation proved superior to
   approximations derived from the Kingman coalescent or continuous-time
   birth-and-death process. This article demonstrates that in analogy to
   methods in human genetics, the SFS of viral sequences sampled well after
   latent infection can remain informative about the initial R-0. Thus, it
   suggests the utility of analyzing the SFS of sequences derived from
   patient and animal trials of viral therapies, because in some cases, the
   initial R-0 may be able to indicate subtle therapeutic progress, even in
   the absence of statistically significant differences in the infection of
   treatment and control groups. Published by Elsevier Inc.},

Title = {A numerical approach to determine mutant invasion fitness and
   evolutionary singular strategies},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {115},
Pages = {89-99},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {We propose a numerical approach to study the invasion fitness of a
   mutant and to determine evolutionary singular strategies in evolutionary
   structured models in which the competitive exclusion principle holds.
   Our approach is based on a dual representation, which consists of the
   modeling of the small size mutant population by a stochastic model and
   the computation of its corresponding deterministic model. The use of the
   deterministic model greatly facilitates the numerical determination of
   the feasibility of invasion as well as the convergence-stability of the
   evolutionary singular strategy. Our approach combines standard adaptive
   dynamics with the link between the mutant survival criterion in the
   stochastic model and the sign of the eigenvalue in the corresponding
   deterministic model. We present our method in the context of a
   mass-structured individual-based chemostat model. We exploit a
   previously derived mathematical relationship between stochastic and
   deterministic representations of the mutant population in the chemostat
   model to derive a general numerical method for analyzing the invasion
   fitness in the stochastic models. Our method can be applied to the broad
   class of evolutionary models for which a link between the stochastic and
   deterministic invasion fitnesses can be established. (C) 2017 Elsevier

Title = {Finding all multiple stable fixpoints of n-species Lotka-Volterra
   competition models},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {115},
Pages = {24-34},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {One way to explore assembly of extant and novel communities from species
   pools, and by that biodiversity and species ranges, is to study the
   equilibrium behavior of dynamic competition models such as the
   Lotka-Volterra competition (LVC) model. We present a novel method
   (COMMUSTIX) to determine all stable fixpoints of the general LVC model
   with abundances x from a given pool of n species. To that purpose, we
   split the species in potentially surviving species (x(i) > 0) and in
   others going extinct (x(i) = 0). We derived criteria for the stability
   of x(i) = 0 and for the equilibrium of x(i) > 0 to determine possible
   combinations of extinct and surviving species by iteratively applying a
   mixed binary linear optimization algorithm.
   We tested this new method against (a) the numerical solution at
   equilibrium of the LVC ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and (b)
   the fixpoints of all combinations of surviving and extinct species
   (possible only for small n), tested for stability and non-negativity.
   The tests revealed that COMMUSTIX is reliable, it detects all multiple
   stable fixpoints (SFPs), which is not guaranteed by solving the ODEs,
   and more efficient than the combinations method.
   With COMMUSTIX, we studied the dependence of the fixpoint behavior on
   the competition strengths relative to the intra-specific competition. If
   inter-specific competition was considerably lower than intra-specific
   competition, only globally SFPs occurred. In contrast, if all
   inter-specific was higher than intra-specific competition, multiple SFPs
   consisting of only one species occurred. If competition strengths in the
   species pool ranged from below to above the intra-specific competition,
   either global or multiple SFPs strongly differing in species composition
   occurred. The species richness over all SFPs was high for pools of
   species with similar, either weak or strong competition, and lower for
   species with dissimilar or close to intra-specific competition
   strengths.
   The new approach is a reliable and efficient tool for further extensive
   examinations of the dependence of community compositions on parameter
   settings of the LVC model. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

   decreasing the heterogeneity of the population all favor the onset of

Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2015},

Pages = {1-6},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Fisher developed his geometric model to support the micro-mutationalism
   hypothesis which claims that small mutations are more likely to be
   beneficial and therefore to contribute to evolution and adaptation.
   While others have provided a general solution to the model using
   geometric approaches, we derive an equivalent general solution using a
   probabilistic approach. Our approach to Fisher's geometric model
   provides alternative intuition and interpretation of the solution in
   terms of the model's parameters: for mutation to improve a phenotype,
   its relative beneficial effect must be larger than the ratio of its
   total effect and twice the difference between the current phenotype and
   the optimal one. Our approach provides new insight into this classical
   model of adaptive evolution. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Genomic parasites or symbionts? Modeling the effects of environmental
   pressure on transposition activity in asexual populations{*}},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {90},
Pages = {145-151},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Transposable elements are DNA segments capable of persisting in host
   genomes by self-replication in spite of deleterious mutagenic effects.
   The theoretical dynamics of these elements within genomes has been
   studied extensively, and population genetic models predict that they can
   invade and maintain as a result of both intra-genomic and
   inter-individual selection in sexual species. In asexuals, the success
   of selfish DNA is more difficult to explain. However, most theoretical
   work assumes constant environment. Here, we analyze the impact of
   environmental change on the dynamics of transposition activity when
   horizontal DNA exchange is absent, based on a stochastic computational
   model of transposable element proliferation. We argue that repeated
   changes in the phenotypic optimum in a multidimensional fitness
   landscape may induce explosive bursts of transposition activity
   associated with faster adaptation. However, long-term maintenance of
   transposition activity is unlikely. This could contribute to the
   significant variation in the transposable element copy number among
   closely related species. (c) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Title = {Plant-animal mutualism in biological markets: Evolutionary and
   ecological dynamics driven by non-heritable phenotypic variance},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {88},

Abstract = {Mutualism between plants and animals, such as in pollination and seed
   dispersal, is a fundamental mechanism facilitating the productivity and
   biodiversity of ecosystems, and it is often considered as an analog of a
   free-market economy. The coevolution of plant reward and animal
   choosiness, however, involves an apparent paradox due to incomplete
   information and limited mutation rates: plant rewards evolve only when
   animals are choosy, but choosy animals purge the heritable variations of
   plants, which then favors less choosy animals. Here we use a two-species
   mathematical model to illustrate how non-heritable phenotypic variances
   of plants may facilitate the coevolution of rewards and choosiness and
   solve the paradox with low mutation rates. We simultaneously track the
   ecological and evolutionary dynamics and show that the population ratio
   links the two processes and tunes the stable ecoevolutionary
   equilibrium. Numerical simulations confirm the analytic prediction with
   varying mutation rates (heritable variance). The efficiency of a
   biological market is generally suboptimal due to the information
   constraint and individual competition. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {Latent mutations in the ancestries of alleles under selection},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {158},
Pages = {1-20},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {We consider a single genetic locus with two alleles A 1 and A 2 in a
   large haploid population. The locus is subject to selection and two-way,
   or recurrent, mutation. Assuming the allele frequencies follow a Wright-
   Fisher diffusion and have reached stationarity, we describe the
   asymptotic behaviors of the conditional gene genealogy and the latent
   mutations of a sample with known allele counts, when the count n 1 of
   allele A 1 is fixed, and when either or both the sample size n and the
   selection strength |a | tend to infinity. Our study extends previous
   work under neutrality to the case of non -neutral rare alleles,
   asserting that when selection is not too strong relative to the sample
   size, even if it is strongly positive or strongly negative in the usual
   sense (a -{*} -infinity or a -{*} +infinity ), the number of latent
   mutations of the n 1 copies of allele A 1 follows the same distribution
   as the number of alleles in the Ewens sampling formula. On the other
   hand, very strong positive selection relative to the sample size leads
   to neutral gene genealogies with a single ancient latent mutation. We
   also demonstrate robustness of our asymptotic results against changing
   population sizes, when one of |a | or n is large.},

Title = {Determining the most recent common ancestor in a finite linear habitat
   with asymmetric dispersal},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {153},
Pages = {91-101},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Many species that are birthed in one location and become reproductive in
   another location can be treated as if in a one-dimensional habitat where
   dispersal is biased downstream. One example of such is planktonic larvae
   that disperse in coastal oceans, rivers, and streams. In these habitats,
   the dynamics of the dispersal are dominated by the movement of offspring
   in one direction and the distance between parents and offspring in the
   other direction does not matter. We study an idealized species with
   non-overlapping generations in a finite linear habitat that has no
   larval input from outside of the habitat and is therefore isolated from
   other populations. The most non-realistic assumption that we make is
   that there are non-overlapping generations, and this is an assumption to
   be considered in future work. We find that a biased dispersal in the
   habitat reduces the average time to the most recent common ancestor and
   causes the average location of the most recent common ancestor to move
   from the center of the habitat to the upstream edge of the habitat. Due
   to the decrease in the time to the most recent common ancestor and the
   shift of the average location to the upstream edge, the effective
   population size (Ne) no longer depends on the census size and is
   dependent on the dispersal statistics. We determine the average time and
   location of the most recent common ancestor as a function of the larval
   dispersal statistics. The location of the most recent common ancestor
   becomes independent of the length of the habitat and is only dependent
   on the location of the upstream edge and the larval dispersal
   statistics.\& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {The effects of epistasis and linkage on the invasion of locally
   beneficial mutations and the evolution of genomic islands},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {144},
Pages = {49-69},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {We study local adaptation of a peripheral population by investigating
   the fate of new mutations using a haploid two-locus two-allele
   continent-island migration model. We explore how linkage, epistasis, and
   maladaptive gene flow affect the invasion probability of weakly
   beneficial de-novo mutations that arise on the island at an arbitrary
   physical distance to a locus that already maintains a stable
   migration-selection polymorphism. By assuming a slightly supercritical
   branching process, we deduce explicit conditions on the parameters that
   permit a positive invasion probability and we derive approximations for
   it. They show how the invasion probability depends on the additive and
   epistatic effects of the mutant, on its linkage to the polymorphism, and
   on the migration rate. We use these approximations together with
   empirically motivated distributions of epistatic effects to analyze the
   influence of epistasis on the expected invasion probability if mutants
   are drawn randomly from such a distribution and occur at a random
   physical distance to the existing polymorphism. We find that the
   invasion probability generally increases as the epistasis parameter
   increases or the migration rate decreases, but not necessarily as the
   recombination rate decreases. Finally, we shed light on the size of
   emerging genomic islands of divergence by exploring the size of the
   chromosomal neighborhood of the already established polymorphism in
   which 50\% or 90\% of the successfully invading mutations become
   established. These `window sizes' always decrease in a reverse sigmoidal
   way with stronger migration and typically increase with increasing
   epistatic effect. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Effects of cultural transmission of surnaming decisions on the sex ratio
   at birth},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {141},
Pages = {44-53},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The patriarchal tradition of surnaming a child after its father in Han
   Chinese families may contribute to their preference for sons, a major
   cause of the abnormally high SRB (sex ratio at birth) in China. This
   high SRB can subsequently contribute to the marriage squeeze on males of
   marriageable age. Encouraging matrilineal surnaming has been proposed as
   a strategy that could potentially reduce son preference and help to
   adjust the imbalance in SRB. Here, we model factors that are likely to
   influence surnaming decisions, including cultural transmission of
   parents' surnaming decisions, the cultural value of a daughter, reward
   given to matrilineal surnaming, and awareness of current imbalance in
   SRB. Mathematical and computational analyses suggest that offering a
   significant reward and raising public awareness of the problems inherent
   in an excess of marriage-age males may overcome the son preference and
   reduce the male-biased SRB. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Title = {A spatial Markovian framework for estimating regional and local dynamics
   of annual plants with dormancy},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {127},
Pages = {120-132},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Many species have a dormant stage in their life cycle, including seeds
   for plants. The dormancy stage influences the species dynamics but is
   often undetectable. One way to include dormancy is to model it as a
   hidden dynamical state within a Markovian framework. Models within this
   framework have already been proposed but with different limitations:
   only presence/absence observations are modelled, the dormancy stage is
   limited to one year, or colonisation from neighbouring patches is not
   taken into account. We propose a hidden Markov model that describes the
   local and regional dynamics of a species that can undergo dormancy with
   a potentially infinite dormancy time. Populations are modelled with
   abundance classes. Our model considers the colonisation process as the
   indistinguishable influence of neighbour non-dormant population states
   on a dormant population state in a patch. It would be expected that
   parameter estimation, hidden state estimation and prediction of the next
   non-dormant populations would have an exponential computational time in
   terms of the number of patches. However, we demonstrate that estimation,
   hidden state estimation and prediction are all achievable in a linear
   computational time. Numerical experiments on simulated data show that
   the state of dormant populations can easily be retrieved, as well as the
   state of future non-dormant populations. Our framework provides a simple
   and efficient tool that could be further used to analyse and compare
   annual plants dynamics like weed species survival strategies in crop
   fields. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Exact limits of inference in coalescent models},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {125},
Pages = {75-93},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Recovery of population size history from molecular sequence data is an
   important problem in population genetics. Inference commonly relies on a
   coalescent model linking the population size history to genealogies. The
   high computational cost of estimating parameters from these models
   usually compels researchers to select a subset of the available data or
   to rely on insufficient summary statistics for statistical inference. We
   consider the problem of recovering the true population size history from
   two possible alternatives on the basis of coalescent time data
   previously considered by Kim et al. (2015). We improve upon previous
   results by giving exact expressions for the probability of correctly
   distinguishing between the two hypotheses as a function of the
   separation between the alternative size histories, the number of
   individuals, loci, and the sampling times. In more complicated settings
   we estimate the exact probability of correct recovery by Monte Carlo
   simulation. Our results give considerably more pessimistic inferential
   limits than those previously reported. We also extended our analyses to
   pairwise SMC and SMC' models of recombination. This work is relevant for
   optimal design when the inference goal is to test scientific hypotheses
   about population size trajectories in coalescent models with and without
   recombination. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.},

Title = {The Wright-Fisher site frequency spectrum as a perturbation of the
   coalescent's},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {124},
Pages = {81-92},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The first terms of the Wright-Fisher (WF) site frequency spectrum that
   follow the coalescent approximation are determined precisely, with a
   view to understanding the accuracy of the coalescent approximation for
   large samples. The perturbing terms show that the probability of a
   single mutant in the sample (singleton probability) is elevated in WF
   but the rest of the frequency spectrum is lowered. A part of the
   perturbation can be attributed to a mismatch in rates of merger between
   WF and the coalescent. The rest of it can be attributed to the
   difference in the way WF and the coalescent partition children between
   parents. In particular, the number of children of a parent is
   approximately Poisson under WF and approximately geometric under the
   coalescent. Whereas the mismatch in rates raises the probability of
   singletons under WF, its offspring distribution being approximately
   Poisson lowers it. The two effects are of opposite sense everywhere
   except at the tail of the frequency spectrum. The WF frequency spectrum
   begins to depart from that of the coalescent only for sample sizes that
   are comparable to the population size. These conclusions are confirmed
   by a separate analysis that assumes the sample size n to be equal to the
   population size N. Partly thanks to the canceling effects, the total
   variation distance of WF minus coalescent is 0.12/log N for a population
   sized sample with n = N, which is only 1\% for N = 2 x 10(4). The
   coalescent remains a good approximation for the site frequency spectrum
   of-large samples. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Full likelihood inference from the site frequency spectrum based on the
   optimal tree resolution},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {124},
Pages = {1-15},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {We develop a novel importance sampler to compute the full likelihood
   function of a demographic or structural scenario given the site
   frequency spectrum (SFS) at a locus free of intra-locus recombination.
   This sampler, instead of representing the hidden genealogy of a sample
   of individuals by a labelled binary tree, uses the minimal level of
   information about such a tree that is needed for the likelihood of the
   SFS and thus takes advantage of the huge reduction in the size of the
   state space that needs to be integrated. We assume that the population
   may have demographically changed and may be non-panmictically
   structured, as reflected by the branch lengths and the topology of the
   genealogical tree of the sample, respectively. We also assume that
   mutations conform to the infinitely-many-sites model. We achieve this by
   a controlled Markov process that generates `particles' in the hidden
   space of SFS histories which are always compatible with the observed
   SFS.
   To produce the particles, we use Aldous' Beta-splitting model for a one
   parameter family of prior distributions over genealogical topologies or
   shapes (including that of the Kingman coalescent) and allow the branch
   lengths or epoch times to have a parametric family of priors specified
   by a model of demography (including exponential growth and bottleneck
   models). Assuming independence across unlinked loci, we can estimate the
   likelihood of a population scenario based on a large collection of
   independent SFS by an importance sampling scheme, using the
   (unconditional) distribution of the genealogies under this scenario when
   the latter is available. When it is not available, we instead compute
   the joint likelihood of the tree balance parameter beta assuming that
   the tree topology follows Aldous' Beta splitting model, and of the
   demographic scenario determining the distribution of the
   inter-coalescence times or epoch times in the genealogy of a sample, in
   order to at least distinguish different equivalence classes of
   population scenarios leading to different tree balances and epoch times.
   Simulation studies are conducted to demonstrate the capabilities of the
   approach with publicly available code. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},

Volume = {119},
Pages = {72-82},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Today, the CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic
   repeats) region within bacterial and archaeal genomes is known to encode
   an adaptive immune system. We rely on previous results on the evolution
   of the CRISPR arrays, which led to the ordered independent loss model,
   introduced by Kupczok and Bollback (2013). When focusing on the spacers
   (between the repeats), new elements enter a CRISPR array at rate theta
   at the leader end of the array, while all spacers present are lost at
   rate rho along the phylogeny relating the sample. Within this model, we
   compute the distribution of distances of spacers which are present in
   all arrays in a sample of size n. We use these results to estimate the
   loss rate rho from spacer array data for n = 2 and n = 3. (C) 2017

Title = {Stability of two-species communities: Drift, environmental
   stochasticity, storage effect and selection},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {119},
Pages = {57-71},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The dynamics of two competing species in a finite size community is one
   of the most studied problems in population genetics and community
   ecology. Stochastic fluctuations lead, inevitably, to the extinction of
   one of the species, but the relevant timescale depends on the underlying
   dynamics. The persistence time of the community has been calculated both
   for neutral models, where the only driving force of the system is drift
   (demographic stochasticity), and for models with strong selection.
   Following recent analyses that stress the importance of environmental
   stochasticity in empirical systems, we present here a general theory of
   the persistence time of a two-species community where drift,
   environmental variations and time independent selective advantage are
   all taken into account. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Projections of health indicators for chronic disease under a semi-Markov
   assumption},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {119},
Pages = {83-90},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Chronic diseases are a growing public health problem due to the
   population aging. Their economic, social and demographic burden will
   worsen in years to come. Up to now, the method used to provide
   projections and assess the future disease burden makes a non-homogeneous
   Markov assumption in an illness-death model. Both age and calendar year
   have been taken into account in all parameter estimations, but the time
   spent with the disease was not considered.
   This work develops the method with a semi-Markov assumption to model
   mortality among the diseased and considering the time spent with the
   disease. The method is applied to estimate several health indicators for
   dementia in France in 2030.
   We find that mortality among the individuals with dementia depends on
   age, calendar year and disease duration, and it is greater for men than
   for women at all ages. The projections for 2030 suggest a 27\% increase
   of the number of dementia cases.
   The model proposed in this work has flexible assumptions that make it
   adaptable to provide projections for various diseases. (C) 2017 Elsevier

Title = {Spatial synchrony and harvesting in fluctuating populations: Relaxing
   the small noise assumption},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {116},
Pages = {18-26},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {In spatio-temporal population dynamic models, the most important
   concept, in addition to mean and variance of local density fluctuations,
   is the spatial scale of fluctuations in density expressed by studying
   the spatial autocovariance function. Analytical formulas for this scale
   in models with local density regulation, dispersal and spatially
   autocorrelated noise, are rather simple when based on asymptotic theory
   giving linear models in the limit as the environmental variance
   approaches zero. The accuracy of these analytical small noise
   approximations has, however, not been investigated theoretically. Here,
   we work out improved approximations for the scale as well the spatial
   autocorrelation function using non-linear logistic local dynamics and
   going to the next order of approximation with respect to the
   environmental variance. Generally, it turns out that the asymptotic
   results are remarkably accurate under moderate fluctuations in density
   but may be inaccurate for very large fluctuations. For populations with
   small dispersal capacity, the main error comes from the fact that the
   logistic dynamics is non-linear, and this error is partly wiped out as
   dispersal increases. Proportional harvesting has a large effect on the
   dynamics in spatial as well as non-spatial models, increasing population
   fluctuations and their spatial scale. The optimal harvesting rate with
   respect to expected yield per time unit, however, is only to a small
   extent affected by the magnitude of population fluctuations unless these
   are very large, so that asymptotic results are applicable over a large
   range of population fluctuations. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {Relationship inference from the genetic data on parents or offspring: A
   comparative study},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {107},
Number = {SI},
Pages = {31-38},

Abstract = {Relationship inference in a population is of interest for many areas of
   research from anthropology to genetics. It is possible to directly infer
   the relationship between the two individuals in a couple from their
   genetic data or to indirectly infer it from the genetic data of one of
   their offspring. For this reason, one can wonder if it is more
   advantageous to sample couples or single individuals to study
   relationships of couples in a population. Indeed, sampling two
   individuals is more informative than sampling one as we are looking at
   four haplotypes instead of two, but it also doubles the cost of the
   study and is a more complex sampling scheme.
   To answer this question, we performed simulations of 1000 trios from 10
   different relationships using real human haplotypes to have realistic
   genome-wide genetic data. Then, we compared the genome sharing
   coefficients and the relationship inference obtained from either a pair
   of individuals or one of their offspring using both single-point and
   multi-point approaches.
   We observed that for relationships closer than 1st cousin, pairs of
   individuals were more informative than one of their offspring for
   relationship inference, and kinship coefficients obtained from
   single-point methods gave more accurate or equivalent genome sharing
   estimations. For more remote relationships, offspring were more
   informative for relationship inference, and inbreeding coefficients
   obtained from multi-point methods gave more accurate genome sharing
   estimations.
   In conclusion, relationship inference on a parental pair or on one of
   their offspring provides complementary information. When possible,
   sampling trios should be encouraged as it could allow spanning a wider
   range of potential relationships. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by

Title = {Dynamics of SI epidemic with a demographic Allee effect},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {106},
Pages = {1-13},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In this paper, we present an extended SI model of Hilker et al. (2009).
   In the presented model the birth rate and the death rate are both
   modeled as quadratic polynomials. This approach provides ample
   opportunity for taking into account the major contributors to an Allee
   effect and effectively captures species' differential susceptibility to
   the Allee effects. It is shown that, the behaviors (persistence or
   extinction) of the model solutions are characterized by the two
   essential threshold parameters lambda(0) and lambda(1) of the
   transmissibility lambda and a threshold quantity mu{*} of the disease
   pathogenicity mu. If lambda < lambda(0), the model is bistable and a
   disease cannot invade from arbitrarily small introductions into the host
   population at the carrying capacity, while it persists when lambda >
   lambda(0) and mu < mu{*}. When lambda > lambda(1) and mu > mu{*}, the
   disease derives the host population to extinction with origin as the
   only global attractor. For the special cases of the model, verifiable
   conditions for host population persistence (with or without infected
   individuals) and host extinction are derived. Interestingly, we show
   that if the values of the parameters alpha and beta of the extended
   model are restricted, then the two models are similar. Numerical
   simulations show how the parameter beta affects the dynamics of the
   model with respect to the host population persistence and extinction.

Title = {Generalized Lotka stability},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {103},
Pages = {38-43},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The recently developed macroscopic approach to demography describes the
   age distribution of mothers and the net maternity function for a given
   human population entirely in terms of five parameters. Tracking of these
   parameters provides a number of new tools for analyzing populations and
   predicting their future states. Within the macroscopic approach, the new
   concept of generalized Lotka stability is presented in this paper, as an
   extension of a strong version of classic Lotka stability. The two
   leading parameters of the macroscopic approach, the Malthusian parameter
   r and the perturbations, are computed from population data and plotted
   in two-dimensional parameter space. Generalized Lotka stability is then
   defined in terms of the movement of the (r, s)-vector over time. It may
   be observed in a number of human populations at specific periods of
   their history. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {A wide range of stochastic processes that model the growth and decline
   of populations exhibit a curious dichotomy: with certainty either the
   population goes extinct or its size tends to infinity. There is an
   elegant and classical theorem that explains why this dichotomy must hold
   under certain assumptions concerning the process. In this note, I

Title = {Coexistence and evolutionary dynamics mediated by seasonal environmental
   variation in annual plant communities},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {84},
Pages = {56-71},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {It is well established theoretically that competing species may coexist
   by having different responses to variation over time in the physical
   environment. Whereas previous theory has focused mostly on year-to-year
   environmental variation, we investigate how within-year variation can be
   the basis of species coexistence. We ask also the important but often
   neglected question of whether the species differences that allow
   coexistence are compatible with evolutionary processes. We seek the
   simplest circumstances that permit coexistence based on within-year
   environmental variation, and then evaluate the robustness of coexistence
   in the face of evolutionary forces. Our focus is on coexistence of
   annual plant species living in arid regions. We first consider
   environmental variation of a very simple structure where a single pulse
   of rain occurs, and different species have different patterns of growth
   activity following the rain pulse. We show that coexistence of two
   species is possible based on the storage effect coexistence mechanism in
   this simplest of varying environments. We find an exact expression for
   the magnitude of the storage effect that allows the functioning of the
   coexistence mechanism to be analyzed. However, in these simplest of
   circumstances, coexistence in our models is not evolutionarily stable.
   Increasing the complexity of the environment to two rain pulses leads to
   evolutionarily stable species coexistence, and a route to diversity via
   evolutionary branching. This demonstration of the compatibility of a
   coexistence mechanism with evolutionary processes is an important step
   in assessing the likely importance of a mechanism in nature. (C) 2012

Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {We study an individual based model describing competition in space
   between two different alleles. Although the model is similar in spirit
   to classic models of spatial population genetics such as the stepping
   stone model, here however space is continuous and the total density of
   competing individuals fluctuates due to demographic stochasticity. By
   means of analytics and numerical simulations, we study the behavior of
   fixation probabilities, fixation times, and heterozygosity, in a neutral
   setting and in cases where the two species can compete or cooperate. By
   concluding with examples in which individuals are transported by fluid
   flows, we argue that this model is a natural choice to describe
   competition in marine environments. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights

   Application to optimal marine protected area size},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {142},
Pages = {114-122},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The standard model of a single population fragmented into two patches
   connected by migration, was first introduced in the 1970s by Freedman
   and Waltman, since generating long-term research interest, though its
   full analysis for arbitrary values of migration rate has only been
   completed relatively recently. Here, we present a model of two competing
   species in a two-patch habitat with migrations between patches. We
   derive equilibrium solutions of this model for three cases of migration
   rate resulting in isolated, well-mixed and semi-isolated habitats. We
   evaluate the full range of effects of habitat, life-history and
   migration parameters on population sizes. Finally, we add harvesting
   mortality and define conditions under which introduction of a
   no-harvesting (protected) area may lead to increased maximum sustainable
   yield. The results have applications in mixed fishery management and the
   design of wildlife protection zones, including marine protected areas
   (MPAs). (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Inferring trait-specific similarity among individuals from molecular
   markers and phenotypes with Bayesian regression},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {132},
Pages = {47-59},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Modeling covariance structure based on genetic similarity between pairs
   of relatives plays an important role in evolutionary, quantitative and
   statistical genetics. Historically, genetic similarity between
   individuals has been quantified from pedigrees via the probability that
   randomly chosen homologous alleles between individuals are identical by
   descent (IBD). At present, however, many genetic analyses rely on
   molecular markers, with realized measures of genomic similarity
   replacing IBD-based expected similarities. Animal and plant breeders,
   for example, now employ marker-based genomic relationship matrices
   between individuals in prediction models and in estimation of
   genome-based heritability coefficients. Phenotypes convey information
   about genetic similarity as well. For instance, if phenotypic values are
   at least partially the result of the action of quantitative trait loci,
   one would expect the former to inform about the latter, as in
   genome-wide association studies. Statistically, a nontrivial conditional
   distribution of unknown genetic similarities, given phenotypes, is to be
   expected. A Bayesian formalism is presented here that applies to
   whole-genome regression methods where some genetic similarity matrix,
   e.g., a genomic relationship matrix, can be defined. Our Bayesian
   approach, based on phenotypes and markers, converts prior (markers only)
   expected similarity into trait-specific posterior similarity. A
   simulation illustrates situations under which effective Bayesian
   learning from phenotypes occurs. Pinus and wheat data sets were used to
   demonstrate applicability of the concept in practice. The methodology
   applies to a wide class of Bayesian linear regression models, it extends
   to the multiple-trait domain, and can also be used to develop
   phenotype-guided similarity kernels in prediction problems. (C) 2019 The

Title = {Incorporating tick feeding behaviour into <i>R</i><sub>0</sub> for
   tick-borne pathogens},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {131},
Pages = {25-37},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Tick-borne pathogens pose a considerable disease burden in Europe and
   North America, where increasing numbers of human cases and the emergence
   of new tick-borne pathogens has renewed interest in resolving the
   mechanisms underpinning their geographical distribution and abundance.
   For Borrelia burgdorferi and tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus,
   transmission of infection from one generation of ticks to another occurs
   when older nymphal ticks infect younger larval ticks feeding on the same
   host, either indirectly via systemic infection of the vertebrate host or
   directly when feeding in close proximity. Here, expressions for the
   basic reproduction number, R-0, and the related tick type-reproduction
   number, T, are derived that account for the observation that larval and
   nymphal ticks tend to aggregate on the same minority of hosts, a tick
   feeding behaviour known as co-aggregation. The pattern of tick blood
   meals is represented as a directed, acyclic, bipartite contact network,
   with individual vertebrate hosts having in-degree, k(in), and
   out-degree, k(out), that respectively represent cumulative counts of
   nymphal and larval ticks fed over the lifetime of the host. The in- and
   out-degree are not independent when co-aggregation occurs such that
   T proportional to < k(in)k(out)>/< k(in)>,
   where <.> indicates expected value. When systemic infection in the
   vertebrate host is the dominant transmission route R-0(2) = T, whereas
   when direct transmission between ticks co-feeding on the same host is
   dominant then R-0 = T and the effect of co-aggregation on R-0 is more
   pronounced. Simulations of B. burgdorferi and TBE virus transmission on
   theoretical tick-mouse contact networks revealed that aggregation and
   co-aggregation have a synergistic effect on R-0 and T, that
   co-aggregation always increases R-0 and T, and that aggregation only
   increases R-0 and T when larvae and nymphs also co-aggregate.
   Co-aggregation has the greatest absolute effect on R-0 and T when the
   mean larval burden of hosts is high, and the largest relative effect on
   R-0 for pathogens sustained by co-feeding transmission, e.g. TBE virus
   in Europe, compared with those predominantly spread by systemic
   infection, e.g. B. burgdorferi. For both pathogens, though,
   co-aggregation increases the mean number of ticks infected per
   infectious tick, T, and so too the likelihood of pathogen persistence.

Title = {Germination variation facilitates the evolution of seed dormancy when
   coupled with seedling competition},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {130},
Pages = {60-73},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Fluctuating environmental conditions have consequences for the evolution
   of life histories because they cause fitness variance. This variance can
   favor risk-spreading strategies, often known as bet-hedging strategies,
   in which growth or reproduction is spread over time or space, with some
   costs, but greater certainty of success. An important example is seed
   dormancy in annual plants, in which some fraction of seed remains
   dormant at any given germination opportunity with the potential of
   germinating later when environmental conditions may differ. Previous
   theory shows that environmental variation is critical for the evolution
   of dormancy. However, these studies have focused on temporal variation
   in reproduction, ignoring the strong observed effects of environmental
   variation on the germination fraction, a major contributor to fitness
   variance. We ask what effects germination fluctuations have on selection
   for dormancy by adding germination fluctuations to existing
   density-independent (d.i.) and density-dependent (d.d.) models of annual
   plant dynamics, extending previous analyses by including temporally
   fluctuating germination. Specifically, we ask how germination variance
   affects selection on the temporal average germination fraction, here
   used to define dormancy. When present alone, or when independently
   varying with other fitness components, germination fluctuations do not
   affect selection for dormancy in the d.i. model, despite generating
   fitness variance because this variance contribution is not reduced by
   higher dormancy. Germination fluctuations have strong effects in the
   d.d. model, favoring dormancy when present either alone or coupled with
   variation affecting plant growth. This is because germination variation
   causes seedling density to vary, which causes variable reproduction
   through variable intraspecific competition. Dormancy is advantaged under
   variable reproduction because it creates a more convex relationship
   between population growth and reproduction leading to benefits from
   nonlinear averaging. Predictive germination, a positive statistical
   association between germination and growth, weakens selection for
   dormancy under strong competition and strengthens it when competition is
   weak. Our results suggest that variable germination is a potential
   explanation for high levels of dormancy observed in nature, with
   implications for life-history theory for fluctuating environments. (C)

Abstract = {In evolutionary biology, randomness has been perceived as a force that,
   in and of itself, is capable of inventing: mutation creates new genetic
   information at random across the genome which leads to phenotypic
   change, which is then subject to selection. However, in science in
   general and in computer science in particular, the widespread use of
   randomness takes a different form. Here, randomization allows for the
   breaking of pattern, as seen for example in its removal of biases
   (patterns) by random sampling or random assignment to conditions.
   Combined with various forms of evaluation, this breaking of pattern
   becomes an extraordinarily powerful tool, as also seen in many
   randomized algorithms in computer science. Here we show that this power
   of randomness is harnessed in nature by sex and recombination. In a
   finite population, and under the assumption of interactions between
   genetic variants, sex and recombination allow selection to test how well
   an allele will perform in a sample of combinations of interacting
   genetic partners drawn at random from all possible such combinations;
   consequently, even a small number of tests of genotypes such as takes
   place in a finite population favors alleles that will most likely
   perform well in a vast number of yet unrealized genetic combinations.
   This power of randomization is not manifest in asexual populations. (C)

Title = {A downstream drift into chaos: Asymmetric dispersal in a classic density
   dependent population model},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {123},
Pages = {9-17},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {In the ocean, propagules with a planktonic stage are typically dispersed
   some distance downstream of the parent generation, introducing an
   asymmetry to the dispersal. Ocean-dwelling species have also been shown
   to exhibit chaotic population dynamics. Therefore, we must better
   understand chaotic population dynamics under the influence of
   asymmetrical dispersal. Here, we examine a density-dependent population
   in a current, where the current has both a mean and stochastic
   component. In our finite domain, the current moves offspring in the
   downstream direction. This system displays a rich variety of dynamics
   from chaotic to steady-state, depending on the mean distance the
   offspring are moved downstream, the diffusive spread of the offspring,
   and the domain size. We find that asymmetric dispersal can act as a
   stabilizing or destabilizing mechanism, depending on the size of the
   mean dispersal distance relative to the other system parameters. As the
   strength of the current increases, the system can experience
   period-halving bifurcation cascades. Thus, we show that stability of
   chaotic aquatic populations is directly tied to the strength of the
   ocean current in their environment, and our model predicts increased
   prevalence of chaos with decreasing dispersal distance. Climate change
   is likely to alter the dispersal patterns of many species, and so our
   results have implications for conservation and management of said
   species. We discuss the management implications, particularly of
   exploited species. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {A cancer grows from a single cell, thereby constituting a large cell
   population. In this work, we are interested in how mutations accumulate
   in a cancer cell population. We provide a theoretical framework of the
   stochastic process in a cancer cell population and obtain near exact
   expressions of allele frequency spectrum or AFS (only continuous
   approximation is involved) from both forward and backward treatments
   under a simple setting; all cells undergo cell divisions and die at
   constant rates, b and d, respectively, such that the entire population
   grows exponentially. This setting means that once a parental cancer cell
   is established, in the following growth phase, all mutations are assumed
   to have no effect on b or d (i.e., neutral or passengers). Our
   theoretical results show that the difference from organismal population
   genetics is mainly in the coalescent time scale, and the mutation rate
   is defined per cell division, not per time unit (e.g., generation).
   Except for these two factors, the basic logic is very similar between
   organismal and cancer population genetics, indicating that a number of
   well established theories of organismal population genetics could be
   translated to cancer population genetics with simple modifications. (C)

Title = {Deploying dengue-suppressing Wolbachia: Robust models predict slow but
   effective spatial spread in <i>Aedes aegypti</i>},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {115},
Pages = {45-60},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {A novel strategy for controlling the spread of arboviral diseases such
   as dengue, Zika and chikungunya is to transform mosquito populations
   with virus-suppressing Wolbachia. In general, Wolbachia transinfected
   into mosquitoes induce fitness costs through lower viability or
   fecundity. These maternally inherited bacteria also produce a
   frequency-dependent advantage for infected females by inducing
   cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI), which kills the embryos produced by
   uninfected females mated to infected males. These competing effects, a
   frequency-dependent advantage and frequency-independent costs, produce
   bistable Wolbachia frequency dynamics. Above a threshold frequency,
   denoted (p) over cap, CI drives fitness decreasing Wolbachia
   transinfections through local populations; but below (p) over cap,
   infection frequencies tend to decline to zero. If (p) over cap is not
   too high, CI also drives spatial spread once infections become
   established over sufficiently large areas. We illustrate how simple
   models provide testable predictions concerning the spatial and temporal
   dynamics of Wolbachia introductions, focusing on rate of spatial spread,
   the shape of spreading waves, and the conditions for initiating spread
   from local introductions. First, we consider the robustness of
   diffusion-based predictions to incorporating two important features of
   wMel-Aedes aegypti biology that may be inconsistent with the diffusion
   approximations, namely fast local dynamics induced by complete CI (i.e.,
   all embryos produced from incompatible crosses die) and long-tailed,
   non-Gaussian dispersal. With complete CI, our numerical analyses show
   that long-tailed dispersal changes wave-width predictions only slightly;
   but it can significantly reduce wave speed relative to the diffusion
   prediction; it also allows smaller local introductions to initiate
   spatial spread. Second, we use approximations for (p) over cap and
   dispersal distances to predict the outcome of 2013 releases of
   wMel-infected Aedes aegypti in Cairns, Australia, Third, we describe new
   data from Ae. aegypti populations near Cairns, Australia that
   demonstrate long-distance dispersal and provide an approximate lower
   bound on (p) over cap for wMel in northeastern Australia. Finally, we
   apply our analyses to produce operational guidelines for efficient
   transformation of vector populations over large areas. We demonstrate
   that even very slow spatial spread, on the order of 10-20 m/month (as
   predicted), can produce area-wide population transformation within a few
   years following initial releases covering about 20-30\% of the target
   area. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Testing neutrality at copy-number-variable loci under the finite-allele
   and finite-site models},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {112},
Pages = {1-13},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Copy-number variation (CNV) is an important form of DNA structural
   variation because a certain proportion of genomes in many eukaryotic
   species can contribute to such variations. Owing to the differences
   between CNV5 and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in size,
   mutation rate and maintaining mechanism, it is more realistic to
   characterize CNV evolution under the finite-allele and finite-site
   models. Here, we propose a method to test multiple CNVs neutrality under
   the finite-allele and finite-site models and the assumption of
   mutation-drift process. The statistical property of the method is
   evaluated through Monte Carlo simulations under the effects of the
   sample size, the scaled mutation rates, the number of CNVs, the
   population demographic change, and selection. Different from Tajima's D
   test, a bootstrap or a permutation approach is suggested to conduct a
   neutrality test. Application of this method is illustrated using the
   diploid CNV genotypes measured in discrete copy numbers in 11 HapMap
   phase III populations. The results show that the mutation-drift process
   can explain the variation of genome-wide CNV5 among 1184 individuals
   (856 CNV5, similar to 0.02 Mb on average in size), irrespective of the
   historical demographic changes. Patterns from allele-frequency-spectrum
   analysis also support the hypothesis of neutral CNVs. Our results
   suggest that most human chromosomal changes in healthy individuals via
   unbalanced rearrangements of the segments with certain sizes are
   neutral. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {On the impact of epidemic severity on network immunization algorithms},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {106},
Pages = {83-93},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {There has been much recent interest in the prevention and mitigation of
   epidemics spreading through contact networks of host populations. Here,
   we investigate how the severity of epidemics, measured by its infection
   rate, influences the efficiency of well-known vaccination strategies. In
   order to assess the impact of severity, we simulate the SIR model at
   different infection rates on various real and model immunized networks.
   An extensive analysis of our simulation results reveals that
   immunization algorithms, which efficiently reduce the nodes' average
   degree, are more effective in the mitigation of weak and slow epidemics,
   whereas vaccination strategies that fragment networks to small
   components, are more successful in suppressing severe epidemics. (C)

Title = {Indirect effects of primary prey population dynamics on alternative prey},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {103},
Pages = {44-59},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {We develop a theory of generalist predation showing how alternative prey
   species are affected by changes in both mean abundance and variability
   (coefficient of variation) of their predator's primary prey. The theory
   is motivated by the indirect effects of cyclic rodent populations on
   ground-breeding birds, and developed through progressive analytic
   simplifications of an empirically-based model. It applies nonetheless to
   many other systems where primary prey have fast life-histories and can
   become superabundant, thus facilitating impact on alternative prey
   species and generating highly asymmetric interactions. Our results
   suggest that predator effects on alternative prey should generally
   decrease with mean primary prey abundance, and increase with primary
   prey variability (low to high CV) unless predators have strong
   aggregative responses, in which case these results can be reversed.
   Approximations of models including predator dynamics (general numerical
   response with possible delays) confirm these results but further suggest
   that negative temporal correlation between predator and primary prey is
   harmful to alternative prey. Finally, we find that measurements of
   predator numerical responses are crucial to predict - even qualitatively
   - the response of ecosystems to changes in the dynamics of outbreaking
   prey species. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {101},
Pages = {54-60},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Migrational mortality is introduced into the classical single-locus
   model for migration and selection. Genotype-independent migration
   follows selection, which may be soft or hard. For soft selection, the
   effect of mortality on the backward migration matrix is the same as in
   the Malecot model; for hard selection, some neutral results still hold,
   but some do not. For two diallelic demes, mortality can increase or
   decrease the stringency of the condition for protecting an allele from
   loss. In the discrete-space, continuous-time limit, mortality increases
   the diagonal elements of the migration rate matrix and decreases its
   off-diagonal elements. Were it not for the same result in the Malecot
   model, it would be surprising that mortality does not alter the general
   diffusion limit for multiple alleles, arbitrary multidimensional
   migration, and arbitrary selection. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

   We present a unified framework for generalized Watterson estimators
   based on Maximum Composite Likelihood, which encompasses most of the
   existing estimators. We propose this class of unbiased estimators as
   generalized Watterson estimators for a large class of NGS data,
   including pools and trios. We also discuss the relation with the
   estimators proposed in the literature and show that they admit two
   equivalent but seemingly different forms, deriving a set of
   combinatorial identities as a byproduct. Finally, we give a detailed
   treatment of Watterson estimators for single or multiple autopolyploid
   individuals. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Reconstructing past population size from present day genetic data is a
   major goal of population genetics. Recent empirical studies infer
   population size history using coalescent-based models applied to a small

   exact coalescence time data needed to recover the population size
   history of a single, panmictic population at a certain level of
   accuracy. In practice, coalescence times are estimated from sequence
   data and so our lower bounds should be taken as rather conservative. (C)

Title = {The consequences of dominance and gene flow for local adaptation and
   differentiation at two linked loci},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {94},
Pages = {42-62},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {For a subdivided population the consequences of dominance and gene flow
   for the maintenance of multilocus polymorphism, local adaptation, and
   differentiation are investigated. The dispersing population inhabits two
   demes in which selection acts in opposite direction. Fitness is
   determined additively by two linked diallelic loci with arbitrary
   intermediate dominance (no over- or underdominance). For weak as well as
   strong migration, the equilibrium structure is derived. As a special
   case, a continuous-time continent-island model (CI model) is analyzed,
   with one-way migration from the continent to the island. For this CI
   model, the equilibrium and stability configuration is obtained
   explicitly for weak migration, for strong migration, for independent
   loci, and for complete linkage. For independent loci, the possible
   bifurcation patterns are derived as functions of the migration rate.
   These patterns depend strongly on the degree of dominance. The effects
   of dominance, linkage, and migration on the amount of linkage
   disequilibrium (LD) and the degree of local adaptation are explored.
   Explicit formulas are obtained for D (=x(1)x(4) - x(2)x(3)) and r(2)
   (the squared correlation in allelic state). They demonstrate that
   dominant island alleles increase D and decrease r(2). Local adaptation
   is elevated by dominance of the locally adaptive alleles. The effective
   migration rate at a linked neutral locus is calculated. If advantageous
   alleles are dominant, it is decreased only slightly below the actual
   migration rate. For a quantitative trait that is determined by two
   additive loci, the influence of dominance on measures of differentiation
   is studied. Explicit expressions for Q(ST) and two types of Fsr at
   equilibrium are deduced and their relation is discussed. (C) 2014 The

Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},

Volume = {93},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Inspired by the use of hybrid cellular automata in modeling cancer, we
   introduce a generalization of evolutionary games in which cells produce
   and absorb chemicals, and the chemical concentrations dictate the death
   rates of cells and their fitnesses. Our long term aim is to understand
   how the details of the interactions in a system with n species and m
   chemicals translate into the qualitative behavior of the system. Here,
   we study two simple 2 x 2 games with two chemicals and revisit the two
   and three species versions of the one chemical colicin system studied
   earlier by Durrett and Levin (1997). We find that in the 2 x 2 examples,
   the behavior of our new spatial model can be predicted from that of the
   mean field differential equation using ideas of Durrett and Levin
   (1994). However, in the three species colicin model, the system with
   diffusion does not have the coexistence which occurs in the lattices
   model in which sites interact with only their nearest neighbors. (c)

Title = {Interconnection between density-regulation and stability in competitive
   ecological network},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {157},
Pages = {33-46},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In natural ecosystems, species can be characterized by the nonlinear
   density-dependent self-regulation of their growth profile. Species of
   many taxa show a substantial density-dependent reduction for low
   population size. Nevertheless, many show the opposite trend; density
   regulation is minimal for small populations and increases significantly
   when the population size is near the carrying capacity. The
   theta-logistic growth equation can portray the intraspecific density
   regulation in the growth profile, theta being the density regulation
   parameter. In this study, we examine the role of these different growth
   profiles on the stability of a competitive ecological community with the
   help of a mathematical model of competitive species interactions. This
   manuscript deals with the random matrix theory to understand the
   stability of the classical theta-logistic models of competitive
   interactions. Our results suggest that having more species with strong
   density dependence, which self-regulate at low densities, leads to more
   stable communities. With this, stability also depends on the complexity
   of the ecological network. Species network connectance (link density)
   shows a consistent trend of increasing stability, whereas community size
   (species richness) shows a context-dependent effect. We also interpret
   our results from the aspect of two different life history strategies: r
   and K-selection. Our results show that the stability of a competitive
   network increases with the fraction of r-selected species in the
   community. Our result is robust, irrespective of different network
   architectures.},

Abstract = {Nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPI) are an important tool for
   countering pandemics such as COVID-19. Some are cheap; others disrupt
   economic, educational, and social activity. The latter force governments
   to balance the health benefits of reduced infection and death against
   broader lockdown-induced societal costs. A literature has developed
   modeling how to optimally adjust lockdown intensity as an epidemic
   evolves. This paper extends that literature by augmenting the classic
   SIR model with additional states and flows capturing decay over time in
   vaccine -conferred immunity, the possibility that mutations create
   variants that erode immunity, and that protection against infection
   erodes faster than protecting against severe illness. As in past models,
   we find that small changes in parameter values can tip the optimal
   response between very different solutions, but the extensions considered
   here create new types of solutions. In some instances, it can be optimal
   to incur perpetual epidemic waves even if the uncontrolled infection
   prevalence would settle down to a stable intermediate level.},

   undergoing genetic adaptation-a process known as evolutionary rescue.
   Here we analytically approximate the probability of evolutionary rescue
   via a niche-constructing mutation that allows carriers to convert a
   novel, unfavorable reproductive habitat to a favorable state at a cost
   to their fecundity. We analyze competition between mutants and
   non-niche-constructing wild types, who ultimately require the
   constructed habitats to reproduce. We find that over-exploitation of the
   constructed habitats by wild types can generate damped oscillations in
   population size shortly after mutant invasion, thereby decreasing the
   probability of rescue. Such post-invasion extinction is less probable
   when construction is infrequent, habitat loss is common, the
   reproductive environment is large, or the population's carrying capacity
   is small. Under these conditions, wild types are less likely to
   encounter the constructed habitats and, consequently, mutants are more
   likely to fix. These results suggest that, without a mechanism that
   deters wild type inheritance of the constructed habitats, a population
   undergoing rescue via niche construction may remain prone to
   short-timescale extinction despite successful mutant invasion.\& COPY;

Title = {Drewnowski's index to measure lifespan variation: Revisiting the Gini
   coefficient of the life table},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {148},
Pages = {1-10},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The Gini coefficient of the life table is a concentration index that
   provides information on lifespan variation. Originally proposed by
   economists to measure income and wealth inequalities, it has been widely
   used in population studies to investigate variation in ages at death. We
   focus on the complement of the Gini coefficient, Drewnowski's index,
   which is a measure of equality. We study its mathematical properties and
   analyze how changes over time relate to changes in life expectancy.
   Further, we identify the threshold age below which mortality
   improvements are translated into decreasing lifespan variation and above
   which these improvements translate into increasing lifespan inequality.
   We illustrate our theoretical findings simulating scenarios of mortality
   improvement in the Gompertz model, and showing an example of application
   to Swedish life table data. Our experiments demonstrate how Drewnowski's
   index can serve as an indicator of the shape of mortality patterns.
   These properties, along with our analytical findings, support studying
   lifespan variation alongside life expectancy trends in multiple
   species.(c) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc. This is an

Title = {Analytical Bayesian models to quantify pest eradication success or
   species absence using zero-sighting records},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {144},
Pages = {70-80},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {It is not possible to establish the absence of a population with
   certainty using imperfect zero-sighting records, but absence can be
   inferred. In this paper we use Bayesian methods to formulate analytical
   inferred distributions and statistics. When such formulations are
   available, they offer a highly efficient and powerful means of analysis.
   Our purpose is to provide accessible and versatile formulations to
   support an assessment of population absence for management decisions,
   using data from a series of regular and targeted surveys with
   zero-sightings. The stochastic processes considered here are prior
   population size, growth and imperfect detection, which are combined into
   a single distribution with sufficient flexibility to accommodate
   alternative distributions for each of the driving processes. Analytical
   solutions formulated include the inferred mean and variance for
   population size or number of infested survey-units, the probability of
   absence, the probability of a series of negative surveys conditional on
   presence, and the probability a population is first detected in a given
   survey, although we also formulate other statistics and provide explicit
   thresholds designed to support management decisions. Our formulation and
   results are straightforward to apply and provide insight into the
   nonlinear interactions and general characteristics of such systems.
   Although motivated by an assessment of population absence following a
   pest eradication program, results are also relevant to the status of
   threatened species, to `proof-of-freedom' requirements for trade, and
   for inferring population size when a population is first detected. (C)\&

Title = {A heuristic model of the effects of phenotypic robustness in adaptive
   evolution},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {136},
Pages = {22-30},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {A recent theoretical, deterministic model of the effects of phenotypic
   robustness on adaptive evolutionary dynamics showed that a certain level
   of phenotypic robustness (critical robustness) is a required condition
   for adaptation to occur and to be maintained during evolution in most
   real organismal systems. We built an individual-based heuristic model to
   verify the soundness of these theoretical results through computer
   simulation, testing expectations under a range of scenarios for the
   relevant parameters of the evolutionary dynamics. These include the
   mutation probability, the presence of stochastic effects, the
   introduction of environmental influences and the possibility for some
   features of the population (like selection coefficients and phenotypic
   robustness) to change themselves during adaptation. Overall, we found a
   good match between observed and expected results, even for evolutionary
   parameter values that violate some of the assumptions of the
   deterministic model, and that robustness can itself evolve. However,
   from more than one simulation it appears that very high robustness
   values, higher than the critical value, can limit or slow-down
   adaptation. This possible trade-off was not predicted by the
   deterministic model. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {A characterisation of the reconstructed birth-death process through time
   rescaling},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {134},
Pages = {61-76},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The dynamics of a population exhibiting exponential growth can be
   modelled as a birth-death process, which naturally captures the
   stochastic variation in population size over time. In this article, we
   consider a supercritical birth-death process, started at a random time
   in the past, and conditioned to have n sampled individuals at the
   present. The genealogy of individuals sampled at the present time is
   then described by the reversed reconstructed process (RRP), which traces
   the ancestry of the sample backwards from the present. We show that a
   simple, analytic, time rescaling of the RRP provides a straightforward
   way to derive its inter-event times. The same rescaling characterises
   other distributions underlying this process, obtained elsewhere in the
   literature via more cumbersome calculations. We also consider the case
   of incomplete sampling of the population, in which each leaf of the
   genealogy is retained with an independent Bernoulli trial with
   probability psi, and we show that corresponding results for
   Bernoulli-sampled RRPs can be derived using time rescaling, for any
   values of the underlying parameters. A central result is the derivation
   of a scaling limit as psi approaches 0, corresponding to the underlying
   population growing to infinity, using the time rescaling formalism. We
   show that in this setting, after a linear time rescaling, the event
   times are the order statistics of n logistic random variables with mode
   log(1/psi); moreover, we show that the inter-event times are
   approximately exponentially distributed. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All

Title = {Randomized matrix games in a finite population: Effect of stochastic
   fluctuations in the payoffs on the evolution of cooperation},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {134},
Pages = {77-91},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {A diffusion approximation for a randomized 2 x 2-matrix game in a large
   finite population is ascertained in the case of random payoffs whose
   expected values, variances and covariances are of order given by the
   inverse of the population size N. Applying the approximation to a
   Randomized Prisoner's Dilemma (RPD) with independent payoffs for
   cooperation and defection in random pairwise interactions, conditions on
   the variances of the payoffs for selection to favor the evolution of
   cooperation, favor more the evolution of cooperation than the evolution
   of defection, and disfavor the evolution of defection are deduced. All
   these are obtained from probabilities of ultimate fixation of a single
   mutant. It is shown that the conditions are lessened with an increase in
   the variances of the payoffs for defection against cooperation and
   defection and a decrease in the variances of the payoffs for cooperation
   against cooperation and defection. A RPD game with independent payoffs
   whose expected values are additive is studied in detail to support the
   conclusions. Randomized matrix games with non-independent payoffs,
   namely the RPD game with additive payoffs for cooperation and defection
   based on random cost and benefit for cooperation and the repeated RPD
   game with Tit-for-Tat and Always-Defect as strategies in pairwise
   interactions with a random number of rounds, are studied under the
   assumption that the population-scaled expected values, variances and
   covariances of the payoffs are all of the same small enough order. In
   the first model, the conditions in favor of the evolution of cooperation
   hold only if the covariance between the cost and the benefit is large
   enough, while the analysis of the second model extends the results on
   the effects of the variances of the payoffs for cooperation and
   defection found for the one-round RPD game. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All

   neutral Moran Model of finite size n epsilon N and in discrete time. The
   stochastic transformations that shape a Moran population can be realized
   directly on its genealogy and give rise to a process on a state space
   consisting of n-sized binary increasing trees. We derive a number of
   properties of this process, and show that they are in agreement with
   existing results on the infinite-population limit of the Moran Model.
   Most importantly, this process admits time reversal, which makes it
   possible to simplify the mechanisms determining state changes, and
   allows for a thorough investigation of the Most Recent Common Ancestor
   process. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Cryptic selection forces and dynamic heritability in generalized
   phenotypic evolution},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {125},
Pages = {20-29},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Individuals with different phenotypes can have widely-varying responses
   to natural selection, yet many classical approaches to evolutionary
   dynamics emphasize only how a population's average phenotype increases
   in fitness over time. However, recent experimental results have produced
   examples of populations that have multiple fitness peaks, or that
   experience frequency-dependence that affects the direction and strength
   of selection on certain individuals. Here, we extend classical fitness
   gradient formulations of natural selection in order to describe the
   dynamics of a phenotype distribution in terms of its moments-such as the
   mean, variance, and skewness. The number of governing equations in our
   model can be adjusted in order to capture different degrees of detail
   about the population. We compare our simplified model to direct
   Wright-Fisher simulations of evolution in several canonical fitness
   landscapes, and we find that our model provides a low-dimensional
   description of complex dynamics not typically explained by classical
   theory, such as cryptic selection forces due to selection on trait
   ranges, time-variation of the heritability, and nonlinear responses to
   stabilizing or disruptive selection due to asymmetric trait
   distributions. In addition to providing a framework for extending
   general understanding of common qualitative concepts in phenotypic
   evolution - such as fitness gradients, selection pressures, and
   heritability - our approach has practical importance for studying
   evolution in contexts in which genetic analysis is infeasible. (C) 2018

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {We introduce the conditional Site Frequency Spectrum (SFS) for a genomic
   region linked to a focal mutation of known frequency. An exact
   expression for its expected value is provided for the neutral model
   without recombination. Its relation with the expected SFS for two sites,
   2-SFS, is discussed. These spectra derive from the coalescent approach
   of Fu (1995) for finite samples, which is reviewed. Remarkably simple
   expressions are obtained for the linked SFS of a large population, which
   are also solutions of the multi-allelic Kolmogorov equations. These
   formulae are the immediate extensions of the well known single site
   theta/f neutral SFS. Besides the general interest in these spectra, they
   relate to relevant biological cases, such as structural variants and
   introgressions. As an application, a recipe to adapt Tajima's D and
   other SFS-based neutrality tests to a non-recombining region containing
   a neutral marker is presented. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {This article describes and compares methods for simulating the component

   permutations to provide a very fast method for simulating logarithmic
   assemblies more generally. For logarithmic multisets and selections,
   this approach is replaced by an acceptance rejection method based on a
   particular conditioning relationship that represents the distribution of
   the combinatorial structure as that of independent random variables
   conditioned on a weighted sum. We show how to improve its acceptance
   rate. We illustrate the method by estimating the probability that a
   random mapping has no repeated component sizes, and establish the
   asymptotic distribution of the difference between the number of
   components and the number of distinct component sizes for a very general
   class of logarithmic structures. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Inc.},

Title = {Wright-Fisher diffusion bridges},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {122},
Number = {SI},
Pages = {67-77},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The trajectory of the frequency of an allele which begins at x at time 0
   and is known to have frequency z at time T can be modelled by the bridge
   process of the Wright-Fisher diffusion. Bridges when x = z = 0 are
   particularly interesting because they model the trajectory of the
   frequency of an allele which appears at a time, then is lost by random
   drift or mutation after a time T. The coalescent genealogy back in time
   of a population in a neutral Wright-Fisher diffusion process is well
   understood. In this paper we obtain a new interpretation of the
   coalescent genealogy of the population in a bridge from a time t is an
   element of (0, T). In a bridge with allele frequencies of 0 at times 0
   and T the coalescence structure is that the population coalesces in two
   directions from t to 0 and t to T such that there is just one lineage of
   the allele under consideration at times 0 and T. The genealogy in
   Wright-Fisher diffusion bridges with selection is more complex than in
   the neutral model, but still with the property of the population
   branching and coalescing in two directions from time t is an element of
   (0, T). The density of the frequency of an allele at time t is expressed
   in a way that shows coalescence in the two directions. A new algorithm
   for exact simulation of a neutral Wright-Fisher bridge is derived. This
   follows from knowing the density of the frequency in a bridge and exact
   simulation from the Wright-Fisher diffusion. The genealogy of the
   neutral Wright-Fisher bridge is also modelled by branching Polya urns,
   extending a representation in a Wright-Fisher diffusion. This is a new
   very interesting representation that relates Wright-Fisher bridges to
   classical urn models in a Bayesian setting. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All

Pages = {11-15},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The standard model for the dynamics of a fragmented density-dependent
   population is built from several local logistic models coupled by
   migrations. First introduced in the 1970s and used in innumerable
   articles, this standard model applied to a two-patch situation has never
   been fully analyzed. Here, we complete this analysis and we delineate
   the conditions under which fragmentation associated with dispersal is
   either favorable or unfavorable to total population abundance. We pay
   special attention to the case of asymmetric dispersal, i.e., the
   situation in which the dispersal rate from patch 1 to patch 2 is not
   equal to the dispersal rate from patch 2 to patch 1. We show that this
   asymmetry can have a crucial quantitative influence on the effect of
   dispersal. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {On the decidability of population size histories from finite allele
   frequency spectra},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {120},
Pages = {42-51},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Understanding the historical events that shaped current genomic
   diversity has applications in historical, biological, and medical
   research. However, the amount of historical information that can be
   inferred from genetic data is finite, which leads to an identifiability
   problem. For example, different historical processes can lead to
   identical distribution of allele frequencies. This identifiability issue
   casts a shadow of uncertainty over the results of any study which uses
   the frequency spectrum to infer past demography. It has been argued that
   imposing mild `reasonableness' constraints on demographic histories can
   enable unique reconstruction, at least in an idealized setting where the
   length of the genome is nearly infinite. Here, we discuss this problem
   for finite sample size and genome length. Using the diffusion
   approximation, we obtain bounds on likelihood differences between
   similar demographic histories, and use them to construct pairs of very
   different reasonable histories that produce almost-identical frequency
   distributions. The finite-genome problem therefore remains poorly
   determined even among reasonable histories. Where fits to few-parameter
   models produce narrow parameter confidence intervals, large
   uncertainties lurk hidden by model assumption. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

   two-dimensional (2D) case of the more general 1/2d (Witting, 1995).
   While the exponents for mass-specific metabolism cluster around the
   predicted -1/4 and -1/6 in terrestrial and pelagic vertebrates, the
   allometries of mobile organisms are more diverse than the prediction. An
   exponent around zero has been reported for protists and protozoa
   (Makarieva et al., 2005, 2008), and the exponent appears to be strongly
   positive in prokaryotes with a value of about 5/6 (DeLong et al., 2010).
   I show that the natural selection of metabolism and mass is sufficient
   to explain exponents for mass specific metabolism that decline from 5/6
   over zero to -1/6 in 3D, and from 3/4 over zero to -1/4 in 2D. These
   results suggest that mass-specific metabolism is selected as the pace of
   the resource handling that generates net energy for self-replication and
   the selection of mass, with the decline in the metabolic exponent
   following from a decline in the importance of mass-specific metabolism
   for the selection of mass. The body mass variation in prokaryotes is
   found to be selected from primary variation in mass specific metabolism,
   while the variation in multicellular animals is selected from primary
   variation in the handling and/or densities of the underlying resources,
   with protists and protozoa being selected as an intermediate lifeform.

Title = {Population-genetic models of sex-limited genomic imprinting},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {115},
Pages = {35-44},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Genomic imprinting is a form of epigenetic modification involving
   parent-of -origin-dependent gene expression, usually the inactivation of
   one gene copy in some tissues, at least, for some part of the diploid
   life cycle. Occurring at a number of loci in mammals and flowering
   plants, this mode of non Mendelian expression can be viewed more
   generally as parentally-specific differential gene expression. The
   effects of natural selection on genetic variation at imprinted loci have
   previously been examined in a several population-genetic models. Here we
   expand the existing one-locus, two-allele population genetic models of
   viability selection with genomic imprinting to include sex-limited
   imprinting, i.e., imprinted expression occurring only in one sex, and
   differential viability between the sexes. We first consider models of
   complete inactivation of either parental allele and these models are
   subsequently generalized to incorporate differential expression. Stable
   polymorphic equilibrium was possible without heterozygote advantage as
   observed in some prior models of imprinting in both sexes. In contrast
   to these latter models, in the sex-limited case it was critical whether
   the paternally inherited or maternally inherited allele was inactivated.
   The parental origin of inactivated alleles had a different impact on how
   the population responded to the different selection pressures between
   the sexes. Under the same fitness parameters, imprinting in the other
   sex altered the number of possible equilibrium states and their
   stability. When the parental origin of imprinted alleles and the sex in
   which they are inactive differ, an allele cannot be inactivated in
   consecutive generations. The system dynamics became more complex with
   more equilibrium points emerging. Our results show that selection can
   interact with epigenetic factors to maintain genetic variation in
   previously unanticipated ways. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {Sexually transmitted infections and mate-finding Allee effects},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {114},
Pages = {59-69},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Infectious diseases can seriously impact dynamics of their host species.
   In this study, we model and analyze an interaction between a sexually
   transmitted infection and its animal host population affected by a
   mate-finding Allee effect. Since mating drives both host reproduction
   and infection transmission, the Allee effect shapes the transmission
   rate of the infection which we show takes a saturating form. Our model
   combining sexually transmitted infections with the mate-finding Allee
   effect in the host produces quite rich dynamics, including oscillations,
   several multistability regimes, and infection-induced host extinction.
   However, many of these complex patterns are restricted to a relatively
   narrow parameter range. We find that the host extinction occurs at
   intermediate levels of infection virulence, as well as for Allee effect
   strengths much lower than when the infection is absent. In both cases, a
   sequence of events comprising destabilization of an endemic equilibrium,
   growth of oscillation amplitude, and a heteroclinic bifurcation forms an
   underlying mechanism. We apply our model to the feline immunodeficiency
   virus (FIV) in domestic cats. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {Resampling: An improvement of importance sampling in varying population
   size models},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {114},
Pages = {70-87},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Sequential importance sampling algorithms have been defined to estimate
   likelihoods in models of ancestral population processes. However, these
   algorithms are based on features of the models with constant population
   size, and become inefficient when the population size varies in time,
   making likelihood-based inferences difficult in many demographic
   situations. In this work, we modify a previous sequential importance
   sampling algorithm to improve the efficiency of the likelihood
   estimation. Our procedure is still based on features of the model with
   constant size, but uses a resampling technique with a new resampling
   probability distribution depending on the pairwise composite likelihood.
   We tested our algorithm, called sequential importance sampling with
   resampling (SISR) on simulated data sets under different demographic
   cases. In most cases, we divided the computational cost by two for the
   same accuracy of inference, in some cases even by one hundred. This
   study provides the first assessment of the impact of such resampling
   techniques on parameter inference using sequential importance sampling,
   and extends the range of situations where likelihood inferences can be
   easily performed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {98},
Pages = {28-37},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {We establish a link between Wakeley et al.'s (2012) cyclical pedigree
   model from population genetics and a randomized directed configuration
   model (DCM) considered by Cooper and Frieze (2004). We then exploit this
   link in combination with asymptotic results for the in-degree
   distribution of the corresponding DCM to compute the asymptotic size of
   the largest strongly connected component S-N (where N is the population
   size) of the DCM resp. the pedigree. The size of the giant component can
   be characterized explicitly (amounting to approximately 80\% of the
   total populations size) and thus contributes to a reduced `pedigree
   effective population size'. In addition, the second largest strongly
   connected component is only of size O(log N). Moreover, we describe the
   size and structure of the `domain of attraction' of S-N. In particular,
   we show that with high probability for any individual the shortest
   ancestral line reaches S-N after O(log log N) generations, while almost
   all other ancestral lines take at most O(logN) generations. (C) 2014

Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {96},
Pages = {20-29},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Cooperative interactions, their stability and evolution, provide an
   interesting context in which to study the interface between cellular and
   population levels of organization. Here we study a public goods model
   relevant to microorganism populations actively extracting a growth
   resource from their environment. Cells can display one of two phenotypes
   - a productive phenotype that extracts the resources at a cost, and a
   non-productive phenotype that only consumes the same resource. Both
   proliferate and are free to move by diffusion; growth rate and diffusion
   coefficient depend only weakly phenotype. We analyze the continuous
   differential equation model as well as simulate stochastically the full
   dynamics. We find that the two sub-populations, which cannot coexist in
   a well-mixed environment, develop spatio-temporal patterns that enable
   long-term coexistence in the shared environment. These patterns are
   purely fluctuation-driven, as the corresponding continuous spatial
   system does not display Turing instability. The average stability of
   coexistence patterns derives from a dynamic mechanism in which the
   producing sub-population equilibrates with the environmental resource
   and holds it close to an extinction transition of the other
   sub-population, causing it to constantly hover around this transition.
   Thus the ecological interactions support a mechanism reminiscent of
   self-organized criticality; power-law distributions and long-range
   correlations are found. The results are discussed in the context of
   general pattern formation and critical behavior in ecology as well as in
   an experimental context. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {New automated and high-throughput methods allow the manipulation and

   interested in the neutral diversity patterns that emerge from such a
   setup in which many bacterial populations are grown in parallel serial
   transfers, in some cases with populationwide extinction and splitting
   events. We model bacterial growth by a birth-death process and use the
   theory of coalescent point processes. We show that there is a dilution
   factor that optimises the expected amount of neutral diversity for a
   given number of cycles, and study the power law behaviour of the
   mutation frequency spectrum for different experimental regimes. We also
   explore how neutral variation diverges between two recently split
   populations by establishing a new formula for the expected number of
   shared and private mutations. Finally, we show the interest of such a
   setup to select a phenotype of interest that requires multiple
   mutations.},

Title = {Solving multispecies population games in continuous space and time},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {146},
Pages = {36-45},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Game theory has emerged as an important tool to understand interacting
   populations in the last 50 years. Game theory has been applied to study
   population dynamics with optimal behavior in simple ecosystem models,
   but existing methods are generally not applicable to complex systems. In
   order to use game-theory for population dynamics in heterogeneous
   habitats, habitats are usually split into patches and game-theoretic
   methods are used to find optimal patch distributions at every instant.
   However, populations in the real world interact in continuous space, and
   the assumption of decisions based on perfect information is a large
   simplification. Here, we develop a method to study population dynamics
   for interacting populations, distributed optimally in continuous space.
   A continuous setting allows us to model bounded rationality, and its
   impact on population dynamics. This is made possible by our numerical
   advances in solving multiplayer games in continuous space. Our approach
   hinges on reformulating the instantaneous game, applying an advanced
   discretization method and modern optimization software to solve it. We
   apply the method to an idealized case involving the population dynamics
   and vertical distribution of forage fish preying on copepods.
   Incorporating continuous space and time, we can model the seasonal
   variation in the migration, separating the effects of light and
   population numbers. We arrive at qualitative agreement with empirical
   findings. Including bounded rationality gives rise to spatial
   distributions corresponding to reality, while the population dynamics
   for bounded rationality and complete rationality are equivalent. Our
   approach is general, and can easily be used for complex ecosystems. (c)

Abstract = {We construct a family of genealogy-valued Markov processes that are

Title = {Application of a Markovian ancestral model to the temporal and spatial
   dynamics of cultural evolution on a population network},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {143},
Pages = {14-29},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Cultural macroevolution concerns a long-term evolutionary process
   involving transmission of nongenetic or cultural traits between
   populations as well as birth and death of populations. To understand the
   spatial dynamics of cultural macroevolution, we present a one-locus
   model of cultural diffusion in which a cultural trait is transmitted on
   a network of populations. Borrowing the method of ancestral backward
   process from population genetics, our model explores the lineage of a
   trait variant sampled in the present generation to quantify when and
   where the variant was invented. Mathematical analysis of the model
   enables us to predict the distribution of cultural age in each
   population of the network, estimate the frequencies of trait variants
   originating from given populations, and discuss the time it takes for a
   trait variant to diffuse between a given pair of populations. We also
   perform numerical analysis on random scale-free network of populations
   to investigate the effect of network topology and innovation rate on the
   age and origin of variants in each population. The result suggests that
   trait variants are more likely to derive from a population with higher
   innovation rate. Our numerical analysis also shows that trait variants
   invented in populations with higher network-centrality values are likely
   to be maintained at a higher frequency and transmitted to other
   populations in a shorter time period. (c) 2021 The Author(s). Published

Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {130},
Pages = {50-59},

Abstract = {We consider the problem of estimating the elapsed time since the most
   recent common ancestor of a finite random sample drawn from a population
   which has evolved through a Bienayme-Galton-Watson branching process.
   More specifically, we are interested in the diffusion limit appropriate
   to a supercritical process in the near-critical limit evolving over a
   large number of time steps. Our approach differs from earlier analyses
   in that we assume the only known information is the mean and variance of
   the number of offspring per parent, the observed total population size
   at the time of sampling, and the size of the sample. We obtain a formula
   for the probability that a finite random sample of the population is
   descended from a single ancestor in the initial population, and derive a
   confidence interval for the initial population size in terms of the
   final population size and the time since initiating the process. We also
   determine a joint likelihood surface from which confidence regions can
   be determined for simultaneously estimating two parameters, (1) the
   population size at the time of the most recent common ancestor, and (2)
   the time elapsed since the existence of the most recent common ancestor.

Title = {Spatial evolutionary dynamics produce a negative cooperation-population
   size relationship},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {125},
Pages = {94-101},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Natural selection can favour cooperation, but it is unclear when
   cooperative populations should be larger than less cooperative ones.
   While experiments have shown that cooperation can increase population
   size, cooperation and population size can become negatively correlated
   if spatial processes affect both variables in opposite directions. We
   use a simple mathematical model of spatial common-pool resource
   production to investigate how space affects the cooperation-population
   size relationship. We find that only cooperation that is sufficiently
   beneficial to neighbours increases population size. However, spatial
   clustering variations can create a negative cooperation-population
   relationship between populations even when cooperation is highly
   beneficial, because clustering selects for cooperation but decreases
   population size. Individual-based simulations with variable individual
   movement rates produced variation in spatial clustering and the
   hypothesized negative cooperation-population relationships. These
   results suggest that variation in spatial clustering can limit the size
   of evolutionarily stable cooperating populations - an ecological dilemma
   of cooperation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Clines with partial panmixia across a geographical barrier in an
   environmental pocket},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {110},
Pages = {1-11},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {In a geographically structured population, partial global panmixia can
   be regarded as the limiting case of long-distance migration. On the
   entire line with homogeneous, isotropic migration, an environmental
   pocket is bounded by a geographical barrier, which need not be
   symmetric. For slow evolution, a continuous approximation of the exact,
   discrete model for the gene frequency p(x) at a diallelic locus at
   equilibrium, where x denotes position and the barrier is at x = +/- a,
   is formulated and investigated. This model incorporates viability
   selection, local adult migration, adult partial panmixia, and the
   barrier. The gene frequency and its derivatives are discontinuous at the
   barrier unless the latter is symmetric, in which case only p(x) is
   discontinuous. A dine exists only if the scaled rate of partial panmixia
   beta < 1; several qualitative results also are proved. Formulas that
   determine p(x) in a step-environment when dominance is absent are
   derived. The maximal gene frequency in the dine satisfies p(0) < 1 -
   beta. A dine exists if and only if 0 <= beta < 1 and the radius a of the
   pocket exceeds the minimal radius a{*}, for which a simple, explicit
   formula is deduced. Given numerical solutions for p(0) and p(a +/-), an
   explicit formula is proved for p(x) in vertical bar x vertical bar > a;
   whereas in (-a, a), an elliptic integral for x must be numerically
   inverted. The minimal radius a{*}{*} for maintenance of a dine in an
   isotropic, bidimensional pocket is also examined. (C) 2016 Published by

Title = {The effectiveness of marine protected areas for predator and prey with
   varying mobility},

Volume = {110},

Abstract = {Marine protected areas (MPAs) are regions in the ocean where fishing is
   restricted or prohibited. Although several measures for MPA performance
   exist, here we focus on a specific one, namely the ratio of the steady
   state fish densities inside and outside the MPA. Several 2 patch models
   are proposed and analyzed mathematically. One patch represents the MPA,
   whereas the second patch represents the fishing ground. Fish move freely
   between both regions in a diffusive manner. Our main objective is to
   understand how fish mobility affects MPA performance. We show that MPA
   effectiveness decreases with fish mobility for single species models
   with logistic growth, and that densities inside and outside the MPA tend
   to equalize. This suggests that MPA performance is highest for the least
   mobile species. We then consider a 2 patch Lotka-Volterra predator-prey
   system. When one of the species moves, and the other does not, the ratio
   of the moving species first remains constant, and ultimately decreases
   with increased fish mobility, again with a tendency of equalization of
   the density in both regions. This suggests that MPA performance is not
   only highest for slow, but also for moderately mobile species. The
   discrepancy in MPA performance for single species models and for
   predator-prey models, confirms that MPA design requires an integrated,
   ecosystem-based approach. The mathematical approaches advocated here
   complement and enhance the numerical and theoretical approaches that are
   commonly applied to more complex models in the context of MPA design.

Title = {Gene drive through a landscape: Reaction-diffusion models of population
   suppression and elimination by a sex ratio distorter},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {108},
Pages = {51-69},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Some genes or gene complexes are transmitted from parents to offsprihg
   at a greater-than-Mendelian rate, and can spread and persist in
   populations even if they cause some harm to the individuals carrying
   them. Such genes may be useful for controlling populations or species
   that are harmful. Driving-Y chromosomes may be particularly potent in
   this regard, as they produce a male-biased sex ratio that, if
   sufficiently extreme, can lead to population elimination. To better
   understand the potential of such genes to spread over a landscape, we
   have developed a series of reaction-diffusion models of a driving-Y
   chromosome in 1-D and radially-symmetric 2-D unbounded domains. The
   wild-type system at carrying capacity is found to be unstable to the
   introduction of driving-Y males for all models investigated. Numerical
   solutions exhibit travelling wave pulses and fronts, and analytical and
   semi-analytical solutions for the asymptotic wave speed under bounded
   initial conditions are derived. The driving-Y male invades the wild-type
   equilibrium state at the front of the wave and completely replaces the
   wild-type males, leaving behind, at the tail of the wave, a reduced- or
   zero-population state of females and driving-Y males only. In our
   simplest model of a population with one life stage and density-dependent
   mortality, wave speed depends on the strength of drive and the diffusion
   rate of Y-drive males, and is independent of the population dynamic
   consequences (suppression or elimination). Incorporating an immobile
   juvenile stage of fixed duration into the model reduces wave speed
   approximately in proportion to the relative time spent as a juvenile. If
   females mate just once in their life, storing sperm for subsequent
   reproduction, then wave speed depends on the movement of mated females
   as well as Y-drive males, and may be faster or slower than in the
   multiple-mating model, depending on the relative duration of juvenile
   and adult life stages. Numerical solutions are shown for parameter
   values that may in part be representative for Anopheles gambiae, the
   primary vector of malaria in sub-Saharan Africa. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Title = {Single generation cycles and delayed feedback cycles are not separate
   phenomena},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {98},
Pages = {38-47},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {We study a simple model for generation cycles, which are oscillations
   with a period of one or a few generation times of the species. The model
   is formulated in terms of a single delay-differential equation for the
   population density of an adult stage, with recruitment to the adult
   stage depending on the intensity of competition during the juvenile
   phase. This model is a simplified version of a group of models proposed
   by Gurney and Nisbet, who were the first to distinguish between
   single-generation cycles and delayed-feedback cycles. According to these
   authors, the two oscillation types are caused by different mechanisms
   and have periods in different intervals, which are one to two generation
   times for single-generation cycles and two to four generation times for
   delayed-feedback cycles. By abolishing the strict coupling between the
   maturation time and the time delay between competition and its effect on
   the population dynamics, we find that single-generation cycles and
   delayed-feedback cycles occur in the same model version, with a gradual
   transition between the two as the model parameters are varied over a
   sufficiently large range. Furthermore, cycle periods are not bounded to
   lie within single octaves. This implies that a clear distinction between
   different types of generation cycles is not possible. Cycles of all
   periods and even chaos can be generated by varying the parameters that
   determine the time during which individuals from different cohorts
   compete with each other. This suggests that life-cycle features in the
   juvenile stage and during the transition to the adult stage are
   important determinants of the dynamics of density limited populations.

Title = {Competing islands limit the rate of adaptation in structured populations},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {90},
Pages = {1-11},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Beneficial mutations can co-occur when population structure slows down
   adaptation. Here, we consider the process of adaptation in asexual
   populations distributed over several locations ({''}islands{''}). New
   beneficial mutations arise at constant rate u(b), and each mutation has
   the same selective advantage s > 0. We assume that populations evolve
   within islands according to the successional mutations regime of Desai
   and Fisher (2007), that is, the time to local fixation of a mutation is
   short compared to the expected waiting time until the next mutation
   occurs. To study the rate of adaptation, we introduce an approximate
   model, the successional mutations (SM) model, which can be simulated
   efficiently and yields accurate results for a wide range of parameters.
   In the SM model, mutations fix instantly within islands, and migrants
   can take over the destination island if they are fitter than the
   residents. For the special case of a population distributed equally
   across two islands with population size N, we approximate the model
   further for small and large migration rates in comparison to the
   mutation rate. These approximations lead to explicit formulas for the
   rate of adaptation which fit the original model for a large range of
   parameter values. For the d island case we provide some heuristics on
   how to extend the explicit formulas and check these with computer
   simulations. We conclude that the SM model is a good approximation of
   the adaptation process in a structured population, at least if mutation
   or migration is limited. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {When can environmental variability benefit population growth?
   Counterintuitive effects of nonlinearities in vital rates},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {89},
Pages = {1-11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Using models for unstructured populations, we investigate the effect of
   environmental variability on population growth when the environment
   affects vital rates through nonlinear functions. We focus here
   especially on interannual variation in food resources availability, for
   which sigmoid functions are relevant. Considering first unregulated
   populations in stochastic environments, we show that classic sigmoid
   annual growth rates cannot lead to positive effects of increased
   environmental variability on population growth. This is true even when
   the temporal average of food availability is low, and Jensen's
   inequality predicts an increased arithmetic mean of the annual growth
   rate. The result is due to the log-concavity of many sigmoid (and other
   accelerating) functions, as convexity of the logarithm of the annual
   growth rate is needed for positive effects of variability to appear.
   Then, separating the effects of a food availability variable on
   reproduction and survival rates, we show that populations with less
   sensitive survival rate to food are more likely to benefit from food
   variability-as opposed to populations that have survival rates
   accelerating with food availability, which is rather counterintuitive
   given Jensen's inequality. Again, this is explained by log-convexity
   properties of nonlinear functions. We further extend these results to
   regulated populations, in which similar positive effects of food
   variability can affect average population size. Positive variability
   effects seem however more likely to occur in regulated populations.
   Finally, we extend our results to stage-structured populations. We
   connect to the previous work showing positive effects of environmental
   variability with matrix models, and show that these effects are well
   captured by simpler unstructured models. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All

Title = {Genetic hitchhiking in spatially extended populations},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {87},
Pages = {75-89},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {When a mutation with selective advantage s spreads through a panmictic
   population, it may cause two lineages at a linked locus to coalesce; the
   probability of coalescence is exp(-2rT), where T similar to log(2Ns)/s
   is the time to fixation, N is the number of haploid individuals, and r
   is the recombination rate. Population structure delays fixation, and so
   weakens the effect of a selective sweep. However, favourable alleles
   spread through a spatially continuous population behind a narrow
   wavefront; ancestral lineages are confined at the tip of this front, and
   so coalesce rapidly. In extremely dense populations, coalescence is
   dominated by rare fluctuations ahead of the front. However, we show that
   for moderate densities, a simple quasi-deterministic approximation
   applies: the rate of coalescence within the front is lambda similar to
   2g(eta)/(rho l), where rho is the population density and l = sigma root
   2/s is the characteristic scale of the wavefront; g(eta) depends only on
   the strength of random drift, eta = rho sigma root 2/s. The net effect
   of a sweep on coalescence also depends crucially on whether two lineages
   are ever both within the wavefront at the same time: even in the extreme
   case when coalescence within the front is instantaneous, the net rate of
   coalescence may be lower than in a single panmictic population. Sweeps
   can also have a substantial impact on the rate of gene flow. A single
   lineage will jump to a new location when it is hit by a sweep, with mean
   square displacement sigma(2)(eff)/sigma(2) = (8/3)(L/l)(Lambda/R); this
   can be substantial if the species' range, L, is large, even if the
   species-wide rate of sweeps per map length, Lambda/R, is small. This
   effect is half as strong in two dimensions. In contrast, the rate of
   coalescence between lineages, at random locations in space and on the
   genetic map, is proportional to (c/L)(Lambda/R), where c is the
   wavespeed: thus, on average, one-dimensional structure is likely to
   reduce coalescence due to sweeps, relative to panmixis. In two
   dimensions, genes must move along the front before they can coalesce;
   this process is rapid, being dominated by rare fluctuations. This leads
   to a dramatically higher rate of coalescence within the wavefront than
   if lineages simply diffused along the front. Nevertheless, the net rate
   of coalescence due to a sweep through a two-dimensional population is
   likely to be lower than it would be with panmixis. (c) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {The fixation index F-ST and the coefficient of gene differentiation
   G(ST) are analyzed for the finite island model under short time spans,
   ignoring mutations. Dividing the reproduction cycle into the three steps
   - gamete formation, fertilization, and migration - we develop a new
   approach for computing quasi equilibrium formulas for F-ST (and G(ST)).
   Our formulas generalize earlier ones and reveal that the equilibrium
   value of F-ST is influenced not only by the migration rate and local
   effective population size, N-e, but also by the local census size N,
   particularly so when the migration rate is high. The order of migration
   and fertilization is found to have a smaller effect on F-ST. A major
   advantage compared to previous approaches is that stochastic allele
   frequency of migrants is easily accommodated, thereby avoiding
   underestimation of F-ST for large migration rates. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {A fast algorithm for computing multi-locus recombination is extended to
   include a recombination-modifier locus. This algorithm and a linear
   stability analysis is used to investigate the evolution of recombination
   rates in a multi-locus, haploid-selection, symmetric-viability model for
   which stable equilibria have recently been determined. When the starting
   equilibrium is symmetric with two selected loci, we show analytically
   that modifier alleles that reduce recombination always invade. When the
   starting equilibrium is monomorphic, and there is a fixed nonzero
   recombination rate between the modifier locus and the selected loci, we
   determine analytical conditions for which a modifier allele can invade.
   In particular, we show that a gap exists between the recombination rates
   of modifiers that can invade and the recombination rate that specifies
   the lower stability boundary of the monomorphic equilibrium. A numerical
   investigation shows that a similar gap exists in a weakened form when
   the starting equilibrium is fully polymorphic but asymmetric. (C) 2012

Title = {Evolutionary entropy predicts the outcome of selection: Competition for
   resources that vary in abundance and diversity},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {83},
Pages = {39-54},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Competition between individuals for resources which are limited and
   diverse in composition is the ultimate driving force of evolution.
   Classical studies of this event contend that the outcome is a
   deterministic process predicted by the growth rate of the competing
   types a tenet called the Malthusian selection principle. Recent studies
   of competition indicate that the dynamics of selection is a stochastic
   process, regulated by the population size, the abundance and diversity
   of the resource, and predicted by evolutionary entropy a statistical
   parameter which characterizes the rate at which the population returns
   to the steady state condition after a random endogenous or exogenous
   perturbation. This tenet, which we will call the entropic selection
   principle entails the following relations:
   (a) When resources are constant, limited and diverse, variants with
   higher entropy will have a selective advantage and increase in
   frequency.
   (b) When resources undergo large variations in abundance and are
   singular, variants with lower entropy will have a selective advantage
   and increase in frequency.
   This article delineates the analytic, computational and empirical
   support for this tenet. We show moreover that the Malthusian selection
   principle, a cornerstone of classical evolutionary genetics, is the
   limit, as population size and resource abundance tends to infinity of
   the entropic selection principle. The Malthusian tenet is an
   approximation to the entropic selection principle an approximation whose
   validity increases with increasing population size and increasing
   resource abundance. Evolutionary entropy is a generic concept that
   characterizes the interaction dynamics of metabolic entities at several
   levels of biological organization: cellular, organismic and ecological.
   Accordingly, the entropic selection principle represents a general rule
   for explaining the processes of adaptation and evolution at each of
   these levels. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Consider the diffusion process defined by the forward equation u(t)(t,

   -infinity < alpha < infinity, with an initial condition u(0, x) =

   model the growth of a population of independently reproducing
   individuals. We explore important coalescent processes related to
   Feller's solution. For any alpha and x(0) > 0 we calculate the
   distribution of the random variable A(n)(s;t), defined as the finite
   number of ancestors at a time s in the past of a sample of size n taken
   from the infinite population of a Feller diffusion at a time t since its
   initiation. In a subcritical diffusion we find the distribution of
   population and sample coalescent trees from time t back, conditional on
   non-extinction as t -> infinity. In a supercritical diffusion we
   construct a coalescent tree which has a single founder and derive the
   distribution of coalescent times.},

Abstract = {Many traits in populations are well understood as being Mendelian
   effects at single loci or additive polygenic effects across numerous
   loci. However, there are important phenomena and traits that are
   intermediate between these two extremes and are known as oligogenic
   traits. Here we investigate digenic, or two-locus, traits and how their
   frequencies in populations are affected by non-random mating,
   specifically inbreeding, linkage disequilibrium, and selection. These
   effects are examined both separately and in combination to demonstrate
   how many digenic traits, especially double homozygous ones, can show
   significant, sometimes unexpected, changes in population frequency with
   inbreeding, linkage, and linkage disequilibrium. The effects of
   selection on deleterious digenic traits are also detailed. These results
   are applied to both digenic traits of medical significance as well as
   measuring inbreeding in natural populations.(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc. All

Title = {A hidden Markov model to estimate homozygous-by-descent probabilities
   associated with nested layers of ancestors},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {145},
Pages = {38-51},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Inbreeding results from the mating of related individuals and has
   negative consequences because it brings together deleterious variants in
   one individual. Genomic estimates of the inbreeding coefficients are
   preferred to pedigree-based estimators as they measure the realized
   inbreeding levels and they are more robust to pedigree errors. Several
   methods identifying homozygous-by-descent (HBD) segments with hidden
   Markov models (HMM) have been recently developed and are particularly
   valuable when the information is degraded or heterogeneous (e.g.,
   low-fold sequencing, low marker density, heterogeneous genotype quality
   or variable marker spacing). We previously developed a multiple HBD
   class HMM where HBD segments are classified in different groups based on
   their length (e.g., recent versus old HBD segments) but we recently
   observed that for high inbreeding levels with many HBD segments, the
   estimated contributions might be biased towards more recent classes
   (i.e., associated with large HBD segments) although the overall
   estimated level of inbreeding remained unbiased. We herein propose a new
   model in which the HBD classification is modelled in successive nested
   levels with decreasing expected HBD segment lengths, the underlying
   exponential rates being directly related to the number of generations to
   the common ancestor. The non-HBD classes are now modelled as a mixture
   of HBD segments from later generations and shorter non-HBD segments
   (i.e., both with higher rates). The new model has improved statistical
   properties and performs better on simulated data compared to our
   previous version. We also show that the parameters of the model are
   easier to interpret and that the model is more robust to the choice of
   the number of classes. Overall, the new model results in an improved
   partitioning of inbreeding in different HBD classes and should be
   preferred. (C)\& nbsp;2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {In this paper we develop a class of models to study a population and
   resource dynamical system in which the decision to give birth is based
   on a rational far-sighted cost-benefit analysis on what the future of
   the resource level will be. This leads to consider a system in which a
   time forward population/resource dynamical system is coupled with a time
   backward Bellman's equation (which models the choice of having a child).
   We construct, from a population model with food consumption, an example,
   to study the change in time of the fertility rate when a catastrophic
   change in resource is announced at a given moment, when a birth control
   policy is announced and we compare these two announcements in case
   nothing happens. Moreover, we provide, mathematical tools to
   theoretically and numerically study this complex coupling of time
   forward and time backward equations. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {Invasion implies substitution in ecological communities with
   class-structured populations},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {134},
Pages = {36-52},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Long-term evolution of quantitative traits is classically and usefully
   described as the directional change in phenotype due to the recurrent
   fixation of new mutations. A formal justification for such continual
   evolution ultimately relies on the ``invasion implies
   substitution{''}-principle. Here, whenever a mutant allele causing a
   small phenotypic change can successfully invade a population, the
   ancestral (or wild-type) allele will be replaced, whereby fostering
   gradual phenotypic change if the process is repeated. It has been argued
   that this principle holds in a broad range of situations, including
   spatially and demographically structured populations experiencing
   frequency- and density-dependent selection under demographic and
   environmental fluctuations. However, prior studies have not been able to
   account for all aspects of population structure, leaving unsettled the
   conditions under which the ``invasion implies substitution{''}-principle
   really holds. In this paper, we start by laying out a program to explore
   and clarify the generality of the ``invasion implies
   substitution{''}-principle. Particular focus is given on finding an
   explicit and functionally constant representation of the selection
   gradient on a quantitative trait. Using geometric singular perturbation
   methods, we then show that the ``invasion implies
   substitution{''}-principle generalizes to well-mixed and scalar-valued
   polymorphic multispecies ecological communities that are structured into
   finitely many demographic (or physiological) classes. The selection
   gradient is shown to be constant over the evolutionary timescale and
   that it depends only on the resident phenotype, individual growth-rates,
   population steady states and reproductive values, all of which are
   calculated from the resident dynamics. Our work contributes to the
   theoretical foundations of evolutionary ecology. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Title = {Maximum likelihood estimators for scaled mutation rates in an
   equilibrium mutation-drift model},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {134},
Pages = {106-118},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The stationary sampling distribution of a neutral decoupled Moran or
   Wright-Fisher diffusion with neutral mutations is known to first order
   for a general rate matrix with small but otherwise unconstrained
   mutation rates. Using this distribution as a starting point we derive
   results for maximum likelihood estimates of scaled mutation rates from
   site frequency data under three model assumptions: a twelve-parameter
   general rate matrix, a nine-parameter reversible rate matrix, and a
   six-parameter strand-symmetric rate matrix. The site frequency spectrum
   is assumed to be sampled from a fixed size population in equilibrium,
   and to consist of allele frequency data at a large number of unlinked
   sites evolving with a common mutation rate matrix without selective
   bias. We correct an error in a previous treatment of the same problem
   (Burden and Tang, 2017) affecting the estimators for the general and
   strand-symmetric rate matrices. The method is applied to a biological
   dataset consisting of a site frequency spectrum extracted from short
   autosomal introns in a sample of Drosophila melanogaster individuals.

Title = {Quantifying the forces that maintain prophages in bacterial genomes},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {133},
Pages = {168-179},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Genome sequencing has revealed that prophages, viral sequences
   integrated in a bacterial chromosome, are abundant, accounting for as
   much as 20\% of the bacterial genome. These sequences can confer fitness
   benefits to the bacterial host, but may also instigate cell death
   through induction. Several recent investigations have revealed that the
   distribution of prophage lengths is bimodal, with a clear distinction
   between small and large prophages. Here we develop a mathematical model
   of the evolutionary forces affecting the prophage size distribution, and
   fit this model to three recent data sets. This approach offers
   quantitative estimates for the relative rates of lysogeny, induction,
   mutational degradation and selection acting on a wide class of prophage
   sequences. The model predicts that large prophages are predominantly
   maintained by the introduction of new prophage sequences through
   lysogeny, whereas shorter prophages can be enriched when they no longer
   encode the genes necessary for induction, but still offer selective
   benefits to their hosts. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Genetic exchange in microbes and other facultative sexuals can be rare
   enough that evolution is almost entirely asexual and populations almost
   clonal. But the benefits of genetic exchange depend crucially on the
   diversity of genotypes in a population. How very rare recombination
   together with the accumulation of new mutations shapes the diversity of
   large populations and gives rise to faster adaptation is still poorly
   understood. This paper analyzes a particularly simple model: organisms
   with two asexual chromosomes that can reassort during rare matings that
   occur at a rate r. The speed of adaptation for large population sizes,
   N, is found to depend on the ratio similar to log(Nr)/log(N). For larger
   populations, the r needed to yield the same speed decreases as a power
   of N. Remarkably, the population undergoes spontaneous oscillations
   alternating between phases when the fittest individuals are created by
   mutation and when they are created by reassortment, which - in contrast
   to conventional regimes - decreases the diversity. Between the two
   phases, the mean fitness jumps rapidly. The oscillatory dynamics and the
   strong fluctuations this induces have implications for the diversity and
   coalescent statistics. The results are potentially applicable to large
   microbial populations, especially viruses that have a small number of
   chromosomes. Some of the key features may be more broadly applicable for
   large populations with other types of rare genetic exchange. (C) 2017

Title = {Adult sex ratio as an index for male strategy in primates},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {126},
Pages = {40-50},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The adult sex ratio (ASR) is defined as the number of fertile males
   divided by the number of fertile females in a population. We build an
   ODE model with minimal age structure, in which males compete for
   paternities using either a multiple-mating or searching-then-guarding
   strategy, to investigate the value of ASR as an index for predicting
   which strategy males will adopt, with a focus in our investigation on
   the differences of strategy choice between chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes)
   and human hunter-gatherers (Homo sapiens). Parameters in the model
   characterise aspects of life history and behaviour, and determine both
   dominant strategy and the ASR when the population is at or near
   equilibrium. Sensitivity analysis on the model parameters informs us
   that ASR is strongly influenced by parameters characterising life
   history, while dominant strategy is affected most strongly by the
   effectiveness of guarding (average length of time a guarded pair
   persists, and resistance to paternity theft) and moderately by some life
   history traits. For fixed effectiveness of guarding and other
   parameters, dominant strategy tends to change from multiple mating to
   guarding along a curve that aligns well with a contour of constant ASR,
   under variation of parameters such as longevity and age female fertility
   ends. This confirms the hypothesis that ASR may be a useful index for
   predicting the optimal male mating strategy, provided we have some
   limited information about ecology and behaviour. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Title = {Energetic constraints and the paradox of a diffusing population in a
   heterogeneous environment},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {125},
Pages = {30-37},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Previous mathematical analyses have shown that, for certain parameter
   ranges, a population, described by logistic equations on a set of
   connected patches, and diffusing among them, can reach a higher
   equilibrium total population when the local carrying capacities are
   heterogeneously distributed across patches, than when carrying
   capacities having the same total sum are homogeneously distributed
   across the patches. It is shown here that this apparently paradoxical
   result is explained when the resultant differences in energy inputs to
   the whole multi-patch system are taken into account. We examine both
   Pearl-Verhulst and Original Verhulst logistic models and show that, when
   total input of energy or limiting resource, is constrained to be the
   same in the homogeneous and heterogeneous cases, the total population in
   the heterogeneous patches can never reach an asymptotic equilibrium that
   is greater than the sum of the carrying capacities over the homogeneous
   patches. We further show that, when the dynamics of the limiting
   resources are explicitly modeled, as in a chemostat model, the
   paradoxical result of the logistic models does not occur. These results
   have implications concerning the use of some ubiquitous equations of
   population ecology in modeling populations in space. (C) 2018 Elsevier

Abstract = {Seed banks are common characteristics to many plant species, which allow
   storage of genetic diversity in the soil as dormant seeds for various
   periods of time. We investigate an above-ground population following a
   Fisher-Wright model with selection coupled with a deterministic seed
   bank assuming the length of the seed bank is kept constant and the
   number of seeds is large. To assess the combined impact of seed banks
   and selection on genetic diversity, we derive a general diffusion model.
   The applied techniques outline a path of approximating a stochastic
   delay differential equation by an appropriately rescaled stochastic
   differential equation. We compute the equilibrium solution of the
   site-frequency spectrum and derive the times to fixation of an allele
   with and without selection. Finally, it is demonstrated that seed banks
   enhance the effect of selection onto the site-frequency spectrum while
   slowing down the time until the mutation-selection equilibrium is
   reached. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {On the transition of genetic differentiation from isolation to panmixia:
   What we can learn from <i>G<sub>ST</sub></i> and <i>D</i>},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {93},
Pages = {75-84},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Population genetic differentiation characterizes the repartition of
   alleles among populations. It is commonly thought that genetic
   differentiation measures, such as G(ST) and D, should be near zero when
   allele frequencies are close to their expected value in panmictic
   populations, and close to one when they are close to their expected
   value in isolated populations. To analyse those properties, we first
   derive analytically a reference function f of known parameters that
   describes how important features of genetic differentiation (e.g. gene
   diversity, proportion of private alleles, frequency of the most common
   allele) are close to their expected panmictic and isolation value. We
   find that the behaviour of function f differs according to three
   distinct mutation regimes defined by the scaled mutation rate and the
   number of populations. Then, we compare G(ST) and D to f, and
   demonstrate that their signal of differentiation strongly depends on the
   mutation regime. In particular, we show that D captures well the
   variations of genetic diversity when mutation is weak, otherwise it
   overestimates it when panmixia is not met. G(ST) detects population
   differentiation when mutation is intermediate but has a low sensitivity
   to the variations of genetic diversity when mutation is weak. When
   mutation is strong the domain of sensitivity of both measures are
   altered. Finally, we also point out the importance of the number of
   populations on genetic differentiation measures, and provide
   recommendations for the use of G(ST) and D. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All

Title = {Fixed point sensitivity analysis of interacting structured populations},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {92},
Pages = {97-106},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Sensitivity analysis of structured populations is a useful tool in
   population ecology. Historically, methodological development of
   sensitivity analysis has focused on the sensitivity of eigenvalues in
   linear matrix models, and on single populations. More recently there
   have been extensions to the sensitivity of nonlinear models, and to
   communities of interacting populations. Here we derive a fully general
   mathematical expression for the sensitivity of equilibrium abundances in
   communities of interacting structured populations. Our method yields the
   response of an arbitrary function of the stage class abundances to
   perturbations of any model parameters. As a demonstration, we apply this
   sensitivity analysis to a two-species model of ontogenetic niche shift
   where each species has two stage classes, juveniles and adults. In the
   context of this model, we demonstrate that our theory is quite robust to
   violating two of its technical assumptions: the assumption that the
   community is at a point equilibrium and the assumption of
   infinitesimally small parameter perturbations. Our results on the
   sensitivity of a community are also interpreted in a niche theoretical
   context: we determine how the niche of a structured population is
   composed of the niches of the individual states, and how the sensitivity
   of the community depends on niche segregation. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Title = {The local enhancement conundrum: In search of the adaptive value of a
   social learning mechanism},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {91},
Pages = {50-57},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Social learning mechanisms are widely thought to vary in their degree of
   complexity as well as in their prevalence in the natural world. While
   learning the properties of a stimulus that generalize to similar stimuli
   at other locations (stimulus enhancement) prima fade appears more useful
   to an animal than learning about a specific stimulus at a specific
   location (local enhancement), empirical evidence suggests that the
   latter is much more widespread in nature. Simulating populations engaged
   in a producer scrounger game, we sought to deploy mathematical models to
   identify the adaptive benefits of reliance on local enhancement and/or
   stimulus enhancement, and the alternative conditions favoring their
   evolution. Surprisingly, we found that while stimulus enhancement
   readily evolves, local enhancement is advantageous only under highly
   restricted conditions: when generalization of information was made
   unreliable or when error in social learning was high. Our results
   generate a conundrum over how seemingly conflicting empirical and
   theoretical findings can be reconciled. Perhaps the prevalence of local
   enhancement in nature is due to stimulus enhancement costs independent
   of the learning task itself (e.g. predation risk), perhaps natural
   habitats are often characterized by unreliable yet highly rewarding
   payoffs, or perhaps local enhancement occurs less frequently, and
   stimulus enhancement more frequently, than widely believed. (C) 2013

Abstract = {A dynamic, two-sex, age-structured marriage model is presented. Part 1
   focused on first marriage only and described a marriage market matching
   algorithm. In Part 2 the model is extended to include divorce, widowing,
   and remarriage. The model Produces a self-consistent set of marital
   states distributed by age and sex in a stable population by means of a
   gender-symmetric numerical method. The model is compared with empirical
   data for the case of Zambia. Furthermore, a dynamic marriage function
   for a changing population is demonstrated in simulations of three
   hypothetical scenarios of elevated mortality in young to middle
   adulthood. The marriage model has its primary application to simulation
   of HIV-AIDS epidemics in African countries. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All

Title = {Aggregation unveiled: A sequential modelling approach to bark beetle
   outbreaks},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {160},
Pages = {62-69},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Tree-killing bark beetle infestations area cause of massive coniferous
   forest mortality impacting forest ecosystems and the ecosystem services
   they provide. Models predicting bark beetle outbreaks are crucial for
   forest management and conservation, necessitating studies of the effect
   of epidemiological traits on the probability and severity of outbreaks.
   Due to the aggregation behaviour of beetles and host tree defence, this
   epidemiological interaction is highly non-linear and outbreak behaviour
   remains poorly understood, motivating questions about when an outbreak
   can occur, what determines outbreak severity, and how aggregation
   behaviour modulates these quantities. Here, we apply the principle of
   distributed delays to create a novel and mathematically tractable model
   for beetle aggregation in an epidemiological framework. We derive the
   critical outbreak threshold for the beetle emergence rate, which is a
   quantity analogous to the basic reproductive ratio, R 0 , for epidemics.
   Beetle aggregation qualitatively impacts outbreak potential from
   depending on the emergence rate alone in the absence of aggregation to
   depending on both emergence rate and initial beetle density when
   aggregation is required. Finally, we use a stochastic model to confirm
   that our deterministic model predictions are robust in finite
   populations.},

Title = {The shirker's dilemma and the prospect of cooperation in large groups},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {155},
Pages = {10-23},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Cooperation usually becomes harder to sustain as groups become larger
   because incentives to shirk increase with the number of potential
   contributors to collective action. But is this always the case? Here we
   study a binary-action cooperative dilemma where a public good is
   provided as long as not more than a given number of players shirk from a
   costly cooperative task. We find that at the stable polymorphic
   equilibrium, which exists when the cost of cooperation is low enough,
   the probability of cooperating increases with group size and reaches a
   limit of one when the group size tends to infinity. Nevertheless,
   increasing the group size may increase or decrease the probability that
   the public good is provided at such an equilibrium, depending on the
   cost value. We also prove that the expected payoff to individuals at the
   stable polymorphic equilibrium (i.e., their fitness) decreases with
   group size. For low enough costs of cooperation, both the probability of
   provision of the public good and the expected payoff converge to
   positive values in the limit of large group sizes. However, we also find
   that the basin of attraction of the stable polymorphic equilibrium is a
   decreasing function of group size and shrinks to zero in the limit of
   very large groups. Overall, we demonstrate non-trivial comparative
   statics with respect to group size in an otherwise simple collective
   action problem.},

Title = {Limits to evolutionary rescue by conjugative plasmids},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {154},
Pages = {102-117},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Plasmids may carry genes coding for beneficial traits and thus
   contribute to adaptation of bacterial populations to environmental
   stress. Conjugative plasmids can horizontally transfer between cells,
   which a priori facilitates the spread of adaptive alleles. However, if
   the potential recipient cell is already colonized by another
   incompatible plasmid, successful transfer may be prevented. Competition
   between plasmids can thus limit horizontal transfer. Previous modeling
   has indeed shown that evolutionary rescue by a conjugative plasmid is
   hampered by incompatible resident plasmids in the population. If the
   rescue plasmid is a mutant variant of the resident plasmid, both
   plasmids transfer at the same rates. A high conjugation rate then has
   two, potentially opposing, effects - a direct positive effect on spread
   of the rescue plasmid and an increase in the fraction of resident
   plasmid cells. This raises the question whether a high conjugation rate
   always benefits evolutionary rescue. In this article, we systematically
   analyze three models of increasing complexity to disentangle the
   benefits and limits of increasing horizontal gene transfer in the
   presence of plasmid competition and plasmid costs. We find that the net
   effect can be positive or negative and that the optimal transfer rate is
   thus not always the highest one. These results can contribute to our
   understanding of the many facets of plasmid-driven adaptation and the
   wide range of transfer rates observed in nature.},

Title = {Disbandment rules that most facilitate the evolution of cooperation},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {154},
Pages = {79-93},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Cooperation is considered a mysterious phenomenon from the perspective
   of adaptive evolution. However, if an individual can separate from an
   unsatisfactory group and join another, then this can facilitate positive
   assortment between cooperative types and promote the evolution of
   cooperation. What kind of disbandment rule most facilitates the
   evolution of cooperation? A previous study investigated exogenous
   disbandment rules and showed that, when games are played between two
   players, a rule where heterogeneous groups disband facilitates the
   evolution of cooperation. However, in groups of more than two
   individuals, a rule strictly requiring homogeneity applied if and only
   if the expected number of rounds played in a group was greater than some
   critical value. How large is the critical value? In this study, we make
   a mathematical analysis using evolutionary game theory. Our results show
   that the critical number of rounds increases greatly as the group size
   increases. Consequently, for species with large group sizes, e.g., Homo
   sapiens, under plausible parameter values, the strict homogeneity rule
   is unlikely to facilitate the evolution of cooperation. We find instead
   that a disbandment rule that requires a threshold level of homogeneity
   outperformed the strict homogeneity rule. Furthermore, we calculate the
   position of internal equilibria at which cooperators and defectors
   coexist and show that the initial evolution of cooperation is most
   encouraged when cooperators are tolerant (intolerant) of defectors if
   the benefit-to-cost ratio is large (small).(c) 2023 The Author(s).

Title = {The nonlinear structure of linkage disequilibrium},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {134},
Pages = {160-170},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The allele frequency dependence of the ranges of all measures of linkage
   disequilibrium is well-known. The maximum values of commonly used
   parameters such as r(2) and D vary depending on the allele frequencies
   at each locus. However, though this phenomenon is recognized and
   accounted for in many studies, the comprehensive mathematical framework
   underlying the limits of linkage disequilibrium measures at various
   frequency combinations is often heuristic or empirical. Here, it is
   demonstrated that underlying this behavior is the fundamental shift
   between linear and nonlinear dependence in the linkage disequilibrium
   structure between loci. The proportion of linear and nonlinear
   dependence can be estimated and it demonstrates how even the same values
   of r(2) can have different implications for the nature of the overall
   dependence. One result of this is the value of D', when defined as only
   a positive number, has a minimum value of vertical bar r vertical bar.
   Understanding this dependence is crucial to making correct inferences
   about the relationships between two loci in linkage disequilibrium. (C)

Title = {Local fluctuations of genetic processes defined on two time scales, with
   applications to effective size estimation},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {131},
Pages = {79-99},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In this paper we develop a general framework for how the genetic
   composition of a structured population with strong migration between its
   subunits, evolves over time. The dynamics is described in terms of a
   vector-valued Markov process of allele, genotype or haplotype
   frequencies that varies on two time scales. The more rapid changes are
   random fluctuations in terms of a multivariate autoregressive process,
   around a quasi equilibrium fix point, whereas the fix point itself
   varies more slowly according to a diffusion process, along a
   lower-dimensional subspace. Under mild regularity conditions, the
   fluctuations have a magnitude inversely proportional to the square root
   of the population size N, and hence can be used to estimate a broad
   class of genetically effective population sizes N-e, with genetic data
   from one time point only. In this way we are able to unify a number of
   existing notions of effective size, as well as proposing new ones, for
   instance one that quantifies the extent to which genotype frequencies
   fluctuate around Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All

Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {130},
Pages = {132-142},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Indirect effects, both density- and trait-mediated, have been known to
   act in tandem with direct effects in the interactions of numerous
   species. They have been shown to affect populations embedded in
   competitive and mutualistic networks alike. In this work, we introduce a
   four-dimensional system of ordinary differential equations and
   investigate the interplay between direct density-effects and density-
   and trait-mediated indirect effects that take place in a yeast
   parasite-zooplankton host-incompetent competitor system embedded in a
   food web which also includes resources and predators. Among our main
   findings is the demonstration that indirect effects cause qualitative
   and quantitative changes almost indistinguishable from direct effects
   and the corroboration through our analysis of the fact that the effects
   of direct and indirect mechanisms cannot be disentangled. Our results
   underpin the conclusions of past studies calling for comprehensive
   models that incorporate both direct and indirect effects to better
   describe field data. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Modelling high pathogenic avian influenza outbreaks in the commercial
   poultry industry},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {126},
Pages = {59-71},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) outbreaks are devastating to
   poultry industries and pose a risk to human health. There is concern
   that demand for free-range poultry products could increase the number of
   HPAI outbreaks by increasing the potential for low pathogenic avian
   influenza (LPAI) introduction to commercial flocks. We formulate
   stochastic mathematical models to understand how poultry-housing (barn,
   free-range and caged) within the meat and layer sectors interacts with a
   continuous low-level risk of introduction from wild birds, heterogeneity
   in virus transmission rates and virus mutation probabilities, to affect
   the risk of HPAI emergence - at both the shed and industry scales. For
   H5 and H7 viruses, restricted mixing in caged systems, free-range
   outdoor access and, particularly, production cycle length significantly
   influence HPAI risk between sectors of the chicken production industry.
   Results demonstrate how delay between virus mutation and detection,
   ensuing from the short production cycle, large shed sizes and industry
   reporting requirements, could mean that HPAI emerges in meat-production
   sheds but is undetected with few birds affected. We also find that the
   Australian HPAI outbreak history appears to be better explained by low
   LPAI introduction rates and low mutation probabilities, rather than
   extremely rare introduction and relatively high mutation probabilities.

Title = {Selecting among three basic fitness landscape models: Additive,

Abstract = {Fitness landscapes map genotypes to organismal fitness. Their
   topographies depend on how mutational effects interact - epistasis - and
   are important for understanding evolutionary processes such as
   speciation, the rate of adaptation, the advantage of recombination, and
   the predictability versus stochasticity of evolution. The growing amount
   of data has made it possible to better test landscape models
   empirically. We argue that this endeavor will benefit from the
   development and use of meaningful basic models against which to compare
   more complex models. Here we develop statistical and computational
   methods for fitting fitness data from mutation combinatorial networks to
   three simple models: additive, multiplicative and stickbreaking. We
   employ a Bayesian framework for doing model selection. Using
   simulations, we demonstrate that our methods work and we explore their
   statistical performance: bias, error, and the power to discriminate
   among models. We then illustrate our approach and its flexibility by
   analyzing several previously published datasets. An R-package that
   implements our methods is available in the CRAN repository under the
   name Stickbreaker. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {New Zealand has one of the highest (per capita) incidences of human
   leptospirosis in the world. It is the highest occurring occupational
   disease in New Zealand, often transmitted from livestock such as deer,
   sheep and cattle to humans. A cyclical model, showing the dynamics of
   infection of leptospirosis in farmed livestock in New Zealand, is
   presented. The limit cycle, bifurcation diagram and quasi-R-0 value of
   the system are determined. Leptospire death rate is used as a control
   parameter. Previously published parameter values are used in a case
   study to produce figures demonstrating analytical results. The model is
   used to predict conditions under which the infection will persist in the
   population. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {The infinitesimal model: Definition, derivation, and implications},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {118},
Pages = {50-73},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Our focus here is on the infinitesimal model. In this model, one or
   several quantitative traits are described as the sum of a genetic and a
   non-genetic component, the first being distributed within families as a
   normal random variable centred at the average of the parental genetic
   components, and with a variance independent of the parental traits.
   Thus, the variance that segregates within families is not perturbed by
   selection, and can be predicted from the variance components. This does
   not necessarily imply that the trait distribution across the whole
   population should be Gaussian, and indeed selection or population
   structure may have a substantial effect on the overall trait
   distribution. One of our main aims is to identify some general
   conditions on the allelic effects for the infinitesimal model to be
   accurate. We first review the long history of the infinitesimal model in
   quantitative genetics. Then we formulate the model at the phenotypic
   level in terms of individual trait values and relationships between
   individuals, but including different evolutionary processes: genetic
   drift, recombination, selection, mutation, population structure,....We
   give a range of examples of its application to evolutionary questions
   related to stabilising selection, assortative mating, effective
   population size and response to selection, habitat preference and
   speciation. We provide a mathematical justification of the model as the
   limit as the number M of underlying loci tends to infinity of a model
   with Mendelian inheritance, mutation and environmental noise, when the
   genetic component of the trait is purely additive. We also show how the
   model generalises to include epistatic effects. We prove in particular
   that, within each family, the genetic components of the individual trait
   values in the current generation are indeed normally distributed with a
   variance independent of ancestral traits, up to an error of order 1/root
   M. Simulations suggest that in some cases the convergence may be as fast
   as 1/M. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.},

Title = {The genealogical decomposition of a matrix population model with
   applications to the aggregation of stages},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {115},
Pages = {69-80},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Matrix projection models are a central tool in many areas of population
   biology. In most applications, one starts from the projection matrix to
   quantify the asymptotic growth rate of the population (the dominant
   eigenvalue), the stable stage distribution, and the reproductive values
   (the dominant right and left eigenvectors, respectively). Any primitive
   projection matrix also has an associated ergodic Markov chain that
   contains information about the genealogy of the population. In this
   paper, we show that these facts can be used to specify any matrix
   population model as a triple consisting of the ergodic Markov matrix,
   the dominant eigenvalue and one of the corresponding eigenvectors. This
   decomposition of the projection matrix separates properties associated
   with lineages from those associated with individuals. It also clarifies
   the relationships between many quantities commonly used to describe such
   models, including the relationship between eigenvalue sensitivities and
   elasticities. We illustrate the utility of such a decomposition by
   introducing a new method for aggregating classes in a matrix population
   model to produce a simpler model with a smaller number of classes.
   Unlike the standard method, our method has the advantage of preserving
   reproductive values and elasticities. It also has conceptually
   satisfying properties such as commuting with changes of units. (C) 2017

Title = {Exploring the dynamics of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) transmission
   in children},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {110},
Pages = {78-85},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the main cause of lower respiratory
   tract infections in children. Whilst highly seasonal, RSV dynamics can
   have either one-year (annual) or two-year (biennial) cycles.
   Furthermore, some countries show a `delayed biennial' pattern, where the
   epidemic peak in low incidence years is delayed. We develop a
   compartmental model for RSV infection, driven by a seasonal forcing
   function, and conduct parameter space and bifurcation analyses to
   document parameter ranges that give rise to these different seasonal
   patterns. The model is sensitive to the birth rate, transmission rate,
   and seasonality parameters, and can replicate RSV dynamics observed in
   different countries. The seasonality parameter must exceed a threshold
   for the model to produce biennial cycles. Intermediate values of the
   birth rate produce the greatest delay in these biennial cycles, while
   the model reverts to annual cycles if the duration of immunity is too
   short. Finally, the existence of period doubling and period halving
   bifurcations suggests robust model dynamics, in agreement with the known
   regularity of RSV outbreaks. These findings help explain observed RSV
   data, such as regular biennial dynamics in Western Australia, and
   delayed biennial dynamics in Finland. From a public health perspective,
   our findings provide insight into the drivers of RSV transmission, and a
   foundation for exploring RSV interventions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All

Title = {Functional response and body size in consumer-resource interactions:
   Unimodality favors facilitation},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {110},
Pages = {25-35},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Theoretical models suggest that competitive coexistence of consumers
   over shared resources can occur only under very restrictive conditions.
   Yet, in apparent defiance of the competitive exclusion principle, large
   numbers of species form natural communities while sharing a small number
   of limiting resources. Consumers not only coexist, but also show
   positive facilitative interactions among themselves. Since body size and
   functional responses may play important roles in these interactions, we
   investigate their joint effects on two consumers over a single resource.
   We find that two consumers with unimodal Type IV functional response can
   facilitate each other by increasing each other's intake rates. But, this
   facilitation does not necessarily impact their co-existence. When the
   consumers differ in their body sizes, the larger consumer receives
   greater absolute benefits, and the smaller consumer gains more relative
   benefits. These results are consistent with empirical observations, and
   do not require any additional assumptions over the parameters governing
   dynamics of resources to explain net positive interactions between
   consumers. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Bayesian pedigree inference with small numbers of single nucleotide
   polymorphisms via a factor-graph representation},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {107},

Pages = {39-51},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {We develop a computational framework for addressing pedigree inference
   problems using small numbers (80-400) of single nucleotide polymorphisms
   (SNPs). Our approach relaxes the assumptions, which are commonly made,
   that sampling is complete with respect to the pedigree and that there is
   no genotyping error. It relies on representing the inferred pedigree as
   a factor graph and invoking the Sum-Product algorithm to compute and
   store quantities that allow the joint probability of the data to be
   rapidly computed under a large class of rearrangements of the pedigree
   structure. This allows efficient MCMC sampling over the space of
   pedigrees, and, hence, Bayesian inference of pedigree structure. In this
   paper we restrict ourselves to inference of pedigrees without loops
   using SNPs assumed to be unlinked. We present the methodology in general
   for multigenerational inference, and we illustrate the method by
   applying it to the inference of full sibling groups in a large sample (n
   = 1157) of Chinook salmon typed at 95 SNPs. The results show that our
   method provides a better point estimate and estimate of uncertainty than
   the currently best-available maximum-likelihood sibling reconstruction
   method. Extensions of this work to more complex scenarios are briefly
   discussed. Published by Elsevier Inc.},

Title = {Is dispersal always beneficial to carrying capacity? New insights from
   the multi-patch logistic equation},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {106},
Pages = {45-59},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The standard model for the dynamics of a fragmented density-dependent
   population is built from several local logistic models coupled by
   migrations. First introduced in the 1970s and used in innumerable
   articles, this standard model applied to a two-patch situation has never
   been completely analysed. Here, we complete this analysis and we
   delineate the conditions under which fragmentation associated to
   dispersal is either beneficial or detrimental to total population
   abundance. Therefore, this is a contribution to the SLOSS question.
   Importantly, we also show that, depending on the underlying mechanism,
   there is no unique way to generalize the logistic model to a patchy
   situation. In many cases, the standard model is not the correct
   generalization. We analyse several alternative models and compare their
   predictions. Finally, we emphasize the shortcomings of the logistic
   model when written in the r-K parameterization and we explain why
   Verhulst's original polynomial expression is to be preferred. (C) 2015

Title = {The entropy of the life table: A reappraisal},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {104},
Pages = {26-45},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The life table entropy provides useful information for understanding
   improvements in mortality and survival in a population. In this paper we
   take a closer look at the life table entropy and use advanced
   mathematical methods to provide additional insights for understanding
   how it relates to changes in mortality and survival. By studying the
   entropy (H) as a functional, we show that changes in the entropy depend
   on both the relative change in life expectancy lost due to death
   (e(dagger)) and in life expectancy at birth (e(0)). We also show that
   changes in the entropy can be further linked to improvements in
   premature and older deaths. We illustrate our methods with empirical
   data from Latin American countries, which suggests that at high
   mortality levels declines in H (which are associated with survival
   increases) linked with larger improvements in e(0), whereas at low
   mortality levels e(dagger) made larger contributions to H. We
   additionally show that among countries with low mortality level,
   contributions of e(dagger) to changes in the life table entropy resulted
   from averting early deaths. These findings indicate that future
   increases in overall survival in low mortality countries will likely
   result from improvements in e(dagger). (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {Cyclical succession in grazed ecosystems: The importance of interactions
   between different-sized herbivores and different-sized predators},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {101},
Pages = {31-39},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Body size of vertebrate herbivores is strongly linked to other life
   history traits, most notably (1) tolerance of low quality forage and (2)
   vulnerability to predation, which both impact the composition and
   dynamics of natural communities. However, no study has thus far explored
   how the combination of these two body-size related traits affects the
   long-term composition and dynamics of the herbivore and plant
   communities. We made a simple model of ordinary differential equations
   and simulated a grassland system with three herbivore species (small,
   medium, large) and two predator species (small, large) to investigate
   how the combination of low-quality tolerance and predation-vulnerability
   structure the herbivore and plant community. We found that facilitation
   and competition between different-sized herbivores and predation by
   especially small predators stimulate coexistence among herbivore
   species. Furthermore, the interaction between different-sized herbivores
   and predators generated cyclical succession in the plant community, i.e.
   alternating periods of short vegetation dominated by high-quality
   plants, with periods of tall vegetation dominated by low-quality plants.
   Our results suggest that cyclical succession in plant communities is
   more likely to occur when a predator predominantly preys on small
   herbivore species. Large predators also play an important role, as their
   addition relaxed the set of conditions under which cyclical succession
   occurred. Consequently, our model predictions suggest that a diverse
   predator community plays an important role in the long-term dynamics and
   maintenance of diversity in both the herbivore and plant community. (C)

Title = {Condition-dependent mate choice: A stochastic dynamic programming
   approach},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {96},
Pages = {1-7},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {We study how changing female condition during the mating season and
   condition-dependent search costs impact female mate choice, and what
   strategies a female could employ in choosing mates to maximize her own
   fitness. We address this problem via a stochastic dynamic programming
   model of mate choice. In the model, a female encounters males
   sequentially and must choose whether to mate or continue searching. As
   the female searches, her own condition changes stochastically, and she
   incurs condition-dependent search costs. The female attempts to maximize
   the quality of the offspring, which is a function of the female's
   condition at mating and the quality of the male with whom she mates. The
   mating strategy that maximizes the female's net expected reward is a
   quality threshold. We compare the optimal policy with other well-known
   mate choice strategies, and we use simulations to examine how well the
   optimal policy fares under imperfect information. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Title = {Consequences of asymmetric competition between resident and invasive
   defoliators: A novel empirically based modelling approach},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {92},
Pages = {107-117},

Abstract = {Invasive species can have profound effects on a resident community via
   indirect interactions among community members. While long periodic
   cycles in population dynamics can make the experimental observation of
   the indirect effects difficult, modelling the possible effects on an
   evolutionary tithe scale may provide the much needed information on the
   potential threats of the invasive species on the ecosystem. Using
   empirical data from a recent invasion in northernmost Fennoscandia, we
   applied adaptive dynamics theory and modelled the long term consequences
   of the invasion by the winter moth into the resident community.
   Specifically, we investigated the outcome of the observed short-term
   asymmetric preferences of generalist predators and specialist
   parasitoids on the long term population dynamics of the invasive winter
   moth and resident autumnal moth sharing these natural enemies. Our
   results indicate that coexistence after the invasion is possible.
   However, the outcome of the indirect interaction on the population
   dynamics of the moth species was variable and the dynamics might not be
   persistent on an evolutionary time scale. In addition, the indirect
   interactions between the two moth species via shared natural enemies
   were able to cause asynchrony in the population cycles corresponding to
   field observations from previous sympatric outbreak areas. Therefore,
   the invasion may cause drastic changes in the resident community, for
   example by prolonging outbreak periods of birch-feeding moths,
   increasing the average population densities of the moths or,
   alternatively, leading to extinction of the resident moth species or to
   equilibrium densities of the two, formerly cyclic, herbivores. (c) 2014

Title = {Within a sample from a population, the distribution of the number of
   descendants of a subsample's most recent common ancestor},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {92},
Pages = {51-54},

Abstract = {Sample n individuals uniformly at random from a population, and then
   sample m individuals uniformly at random from the sample. Consider the
   most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of the subsample of m individuals.
   Let the subsample MRCA have j descendants in the sample (m <= j <= n).
   Under a Moran or coalescent model (and therefore under many other
   models), the probability that j = n is known. In this case, the
   subsample MRCA is an ancestor of every sampled individual, and the
   subsample and sample MRCAs are identical. The probability that j = m is
   also known. In this case, the subsample MRCA is an ancestor of no
   sampled individual outside the subsample. This article derives the
   complete distribution off, enabling inferences from the corresponding
   p-value. The text presents hypothetical statistical applications
   pertinent to taxonomy (the gene flow between Neanderthals and
   anatomically modern humans) and medicine (the association of genetic
   markers with disease). (C) 2013 The Author. Published by Elsevier Inc.},

Title = {Trade-off between learning and exploitation: The Pareto-optimal versus
   evolutionarily stable learning schedule in cumulative cultural evolution},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {91},
Pages = {37-43},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Inheritance of culture is achieved by social learning and improvement is
   achieved by individual learning. To realize cumulative cultural
   evolution, social and individual learning should be performed in this
   order in one's life. However, it is not clear whether such a learning
   schedule can evolve by the maximization of individual fitness. Here we
   study optimal allocation of lifetime to learning and exploitation in a
   two-stage life history model under a constant environment. We show that
   the learning schedule by which high cultural level is achieved through
   cumulative cultural evolution is unlikely to evolve as a result of the
   maximization of individual fitness, if there exists a trade-off between
   the time spent in learning and the time spent in exploiting the
   knowledge that has been learned in earlier stages of one's life.
   Collapse of a fully developed culture is predicted by a game-theoretical
   analysis where individuals behave selfishly, e.g., less learning and
   more exploiting. The present study suggests that such factors as group
   selection, the ability of learning-while-working ({''}on the job
   training{''}), or environmental fluctuation might be important in the
   realization of rapid and cumulative cultural evolution that is observed
   in humans. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Spatial heterogeneity promotes coexistence of rock-paper-scissors
   metacommunities},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {86},
Pages = {1-11},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The rock-paper-scissors game - which is characterized by three
   strategies R, P, S, satisfying the non-transitive relations S excludes
   P, P excludes R, and R excludes S - serves as a simple prototype for
   studying more complex non-transitive systems. For well-mixed systems
   where interactions result in fitness reductions of the losers exceeding
   fitness gains of the winners, classical theory predicts that two
   strategies go extinct. The effects of spatial heterogeneity and
   dispersal rates on this outcome are analyzed using a general framework
   for evolutionary games in patchy landscapes. The analysis reveals that
   coexistence is determined by the rates at which dominant strategies
   invade a landscape occupied by the subordinate strategy (e.g. rock
   invades a landscape occupied by scissors) and the rates at which
   subordinate strategies get excluded in a landscape occupied by the
   dominant strategy (e.g. scissors gets excluded in a landscape occupied
   by rock). These invasion and exclusion rates correspond to eigenvalues
   of the linearized dynamics near single strategy equilibria. Coexistence
   occurs when the product of the invasion rates exceeds the product of the
   exclusion rates. Provided there is sufficient spatial variation in
   payoffs, the analysis identifies a critical dispersal rate d{*} required
   for regional persistence. For dispersal rates below d{*}, the product of
   the invasion rates exceeds the product of the exclusion rates and the
   rock-paper-scissors metacommunities persist regionally despite being
   extinction prone locally. For dispersal rates above d{*}, the product of
   the exclusion rates exceeds the product of the invasion rates and the
   strategies are extinction prone. These results highlight the delicate
   interplay between spatial heterogeneity and dispersal in mediating
   long-term outcomes for evolutionary games. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All

Title = {Stage and age structured <i>Aedes vexans</i> and <i>Culex pipiens</i>
   (Diptera: Culicidae) climate-dependent matrix population model},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {83},
Pages = {82-94},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Aedes vexans and Culex pipiens mosquitoes are potential vectors of many
   arbovirial diseases. Due to the ongoing climate changes and reappearance
   of some zoonoses that were considered eradicated, there is a growing
   concern about potential disease outbreaks. Therefore, the prediction of
   increased adult population abundances becomes an essential tool for the
   appropriate implementation of mosquito control strategies. In order to
   describe the population dynamics of A. vexans and C pipiens mosquitoes
   in temperate climate regions, a 3-year period (2008-2010)
   climate-dependent model was constructed. The models represent a
   combination of mathematical modeling and computer simulations, and
   include temperature, rainfall, photoperiods, and the flooding dynamics
   of A. vexans breeding sites. Both models are structured according to the
   developmental stages, and by individuals' ``age{''} (i.e., time spent in
   each developmental stage), as we wanted to enable a time delay between
   the appearances of different developmental stages of mosquitoes. The
   time delay length is temperature dependent, with temperature being the
   most important factor influencing morphogenesis rates in immatures and
   gonotrophic cycle durations in adult mosquitoes. To determine which
   developmental stages are the most sensitive and are those at which
   control measures should be aimed, transient elasticities were
   calculated. The analysis showed that both mosquito species reacted to
   perturbation of the same matrix elements; however, in the C pipiens
   model, the stage with greatest proportional sensitivity (i.e.,
   elasticity) during most of the three-year reproduction season contained
   adults, while in the A. vexans model it contained larvae. The models
   were validated by comparing 7-day model outputs with data on human bait
   collection (HBC) obtained from the Public Health Institute of
   Osijek-Baranja, with both model outputs showing valid compatibility with
   field data over the three-year period. The proposed models can easily be
   modified to describe population dynamics of other mosquito species in
   different geographical areas, as well as for assessing the efficiency
   and optimization of different mosquito control strategies. (C) 2012

Title = {Joint identity among loci under mutation and regular inbreeding},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {159},
Pages = {74-90},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This study describes a compact method for determining joint
   probabilities of identity-by-state (IBS) within and between loci in
   populations evolving under genetic drift, crossing-over, mutation, and
   regular inbreeding (partial self-fertilization). Analogues of classical
   indices of associations among loci arise as functions of these joint
   identities. This coalescence-based analysis indicates that multi-locus
   associations reflect simultaneous coalescence events across loci.
   Measures of association depend on genetic diversity rather than allelic
   frequencies, as do linkage disequilibrium and its relatives. Scaled
   indices designed to show monotonic dependence on rates of crossing-over,
   inbreeding, and mutation may prove useful for interpreting patterns of
   genome-scale variation.},

Title = {On the connections between the spatial Lambda-Fleming-Viot model and

Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {158},
Pages = {139-149},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The introduction of the spatial Lambda-Fleming-Viot model (AV) in
   population genetics was mainly driven by the pioneering work of Alison
   Etheridge, in collaboration with Nick Barton and Amandine V \&
   eacute;ber about ten years ago (Barton et al., 2010; Barton et al.,
   2013). The AV model provides a sound mathematical framework for
   describing the evolution of a population of related individuals along a
   spatial continuum. It alleviates the ``pain in the torus{''}issue with
   Wright and Mal \& eacute;cot's isolation by distance model and is
   sampling consistent, making it a tool of choice for statistical
   inference. Yet, little is known about the potential connections between
   the AV and other stochastic processes generating trees and the spatial
   coordinates along the corresponding lineages. This work focuses on a
   version of the AV whereby lineages move rapidly over small distances.
   Using simulations, we show that the induced AV tree-generating process
   is well approximated by a birth-death model. Our results also indicate
   that Brownian motions modelling the movements of lines of descent along
   birth-death trees do not generally provide a good approximation of the
   AV due to habitat boundaries effects that play an increasingly important
   role in the long run. Accounting for habitat boundaries through
   reflected Brownian motions considerably increases the similarity to the
   AV model however. Finally, we describe efficient algorithms for fast
   simulation of the backward and forward in time versions of the AV model.},

Title = {Copuling population dynamics and diel migration patterns},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {151},
Pages = {19-27},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The diel vertical migration is one of the main drivers of population
   dynamics in the ocean. Population dynamical models of the ocean
   typically do not incorporate the behavioral aspects of the migration. We
   demonstrate a model with coupled population dynamics and behavior with
   the diel vertical migration emerging. We study the population dynamics
   and behavioral dynamics of a predator-prey system. We impose a cost of
   motion for both consumers and prey, and model each individual as
   following an Ito stochastic differential equation. We study the
   fixed-points of the ecosystem. Our modeling shows that as we increase
   the basal resource load, the strength of the diel vertical migration
   increases, as well as maximal velocity. In addition, a bimodal pattern
   emerges both for predators and consumers. The increase in the magnitude
   of the diel vertical migration causes a change in the allocation of
   copepod resources. (c) 2023 The Author. Published by Elsevier Inc. This

Title = {Male mating choices: The drive behind menopause?},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {145},
Pages = {126-135},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {When we examine the life history of humans against our closest primate
   relatives, the other great apes, there is notably a greater longevity in
   humans which includes a distinctive postmenopausal life stage, leading
   to the question, ``How did human females evolve to have old-age
   infertility?{''}In their paper ``Mate choice and the origin of
   menopause{''}(Morton et al., 2013), Morton et al. developed an
   agentbased model (ABM) to investigate the novel hypothesis that
   ancestral male mating choices, particularly forgoing mating with older
   females, were the driving force behind the evolution of menopause. From
   their model, they concluded that indeed male preference for young female
   mates could have driven females to lose fertility at older ages through
   deleterious mutations, leading to menopause. In this work, we revisit
   their male-mate-choice hypothesis by formulating an analogous
   mathematical model using a system of ordinary differential equations
   (ODEs). We first show that our ODE model recreates the qualitative
   behaviour and hence conclusions of key scenarios in Morton et al.
   (2013). However, since our ODE system is less computationally demanding
   than their ABM, we also conduct a broader sensitivity analysis over a
   range of parameters and differing initial conditions to analyse the
   dependence on their conclusions to underlying assumptions. Our results
   challenge those of Morton et al. as we find that even the slightest
   deviation from an exclusive mating preference for younger females would
   counteract the evolution of menopause. Consequently, we propose that
   their male-mate-choice hypothesis is incomplete and needs further
   explanation of how a male strategy to exclusively mate with young
   females could have arisen in our common ancestors and remained
   evolutionarily stable for long enough to drive the evolution of old-age
   female infertility. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Ecological dynamics and large scale phenotypic differentiation in
   density-dependent populations},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {127},
Pages = {133-143},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Spatial differentiation of phenotypes is assumed to be determined by a
   combination of fluctuating selection producing adaptations to the local
   environment and a homogenizing effect of migration. We present a model
   with density regulation and a density-dependent fitness function
   affected by spatiotemporal variability in population size driven by
   spatially correlated fluctuations in the environment causing fluctuating
   r- and K-selection on a set of traits. We derive the variance in local
   mean phenotypes and show how the spatial scales of the correlations
   between the components of the mean phenotype depend on ecological
   parameters. The degree of spatial differentiation of phenotypes is
   strongly influenced by parameters affecting ecological dynamics. In the
   case of a one-dimensional character the geographical scale of variation
   in the mean phenotype has simply an additive term corresponding to the
   Moran effect in population dynamics as well as a term determined by
   dispersal and strength of local selection. The degree of phenotypic
   differentiation increases with decreasing strength of local density
   dependence and decreasing strength of local selection. These results
   imply that the form of the spatial autocorrelation function can reveal
   important information about ecological and evolutionary processes
   causing phenotypic differentiation in space. (C) 2019 The Authors.

   environments},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {127},
Pages = {102-119},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Traveling fronts describe the transition between two alternative states
   in a great number of physical and biological systems. Examples include
   the spread of beneficial mutations, chemical reactions, and the
   invasions by foreign species. In homogeneous environments, the
   alternative states are separated by a smooth front moving at a constant
   velocity. This simple picture can break down in structured environments
   such as tissues, patchy landscapes, and microfluidic devices. Habitat
   fragmentation can pin the front at a particular location or lock
   invasion velocities into specific values. Locked velocities are not
   sensitive to moderate changes in dispersal or growth and are determined
   by the spatial and temporal periodicity of the environment. The
   synchronization with the environment results in discontinuous fronts
   that propagate as periodic pulses. We characterize the transition from
   continuous to locked invasions and show that it is controlled by
   positive density-dependence in dispersal or growth. We also demonstrate
   that velocity locking is robust to demographic and environmental
   fluctuations and examine stochastic dynamics and evolution in locked
   invasions. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Effects of population- and seed bank size fluctuations on neutral
   evolution and efficacy of natural selection},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {123},
Pages = {45-69},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Population genetics models typically consider a fixed population size
   and a unique selection coefficient. However, population dynamics
   inherently generate fluctuations in numbers of individuals and selection
   acts on various components of the individuals' fitness. In plant species
   with seed banks, the size of both the above- and below-ground
   compartments induce fluctuations depending on seed production and the
   state of the seed bank. We investigate if this fluctuation has
   consequences on (1) the rate of genetic drift, and (2) the efficacy of
   selection. We consider four variants of two-allele Moran-type models
   defined by combinations of presence and absence of fluctuations in the
   population size in above-ground and seed bank compartments. Time scale
   analysis and dimension reduction methods allow us to reduce the
   corresponding Fokker-Planck equations to one-dimensional diffusion
   approximations of a Moran model. We first show that if the fluctuations
   of above-ground population size classically affect the rate of genetic
   drift, fluctuations of below-ground population size reduce the diversity
   storage effect of the seed bank. Second, we consider that selection can
   act on four different components of the plant fitness: plant or seed
   death rate, seed production or seed germination. Our striking result is
   that the efficacy of selection for seed death rate or germination rate
   is reduced by fluctuations in the seed bank size, whereas selection
   occurring on plant death rate or seed production is not affected. We
   derive the expected site-frequency spectrum reflecting this
   heterogeneity in selection efficacy between genes underpinning different
   plant fitness components. Our results highlight the importance to
   consider the effect of ecological noise to predict the impact of seed
   banks on neutral and selective evolution. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All

Title = {Determining the distribution of fitness effects using a generalized
   Beta-Burr distribution},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {122},
Number = {SI},
Pages = {88-96},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {In Beisel et al. (2007), a likelihood framework, based on extreme value
   theory (EVT), was developed for determining the distribution of fitness
   effects for adaptive mutations. In this paper we extend this framework
   beyond the extreme distributions and develop a likelihood framework for
   testing whether or not extreme value theory applies. By making two
   simple adjustments to the Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD) we
   introduce a new simple five parameter probability density function that
   incorporates nearly every common (continuous) probability model ever
   used. This means that all of the common models are nested. This has
   important implications in model selection beyond determining the
   distribution of fitness effects. However, we demonstrate the use of this
   distribution utilizing likelihood ratio testing to evaluate alternative
   distributions to the Gumbel and Weibull domains of attraction of fitness
   effects. We use a bootstrap strategy, utilizing importance sampling, to
   determine where in the parameter space will the test be most powerful in
   detecting deviations from these domains and at what sample size, with
   focus on small sample sizes (n < 20). Our results indicate that the
   likelihood ratio test is most powerful in detecting deviation from the
   Gumbel domain when the shape parameters of the model are small while the
   test is more powerful in detecting deviations from the Weibull domain
   when these parameters are large. As expected, an increase in sample size
   improves the power of the test. This improvement is observed to occur
   quickly with sample size n >= 10 in tests related to the Gumbel domain
   and n >= 15 in the case of the Weibull domain.
   This manuscript is in tribute to the contributions of Dr. Paul Joyce to
   the areas of Population Genetics, Probability Theory and Mathematical
   Statistics. A Tribute section is provided at the end that includes
   Paul's original writing in the first iterations of this manuscript. The
   Introduction and Alternatives to the GPD sections were obtained from the
   last iteration that Paul and I have worked on, with some adjustments. I
   hope that the rest gives justice to his thoughts and possible
   conclusions that he might have wanted to portray. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {A population genetics model based on a multitype branching process, or
   equivalently a Galton-Watson branching process for multiple alleles, is
   presented. The diffusion limit forward Kolmogorov equation is derived
   for the case of neutral mutations. The asymptotic stationary solution is
   obtained and has the property that the extant population partitions into
   subpopulations whose relative sizes are determined by mutation rates. An
   approximate time-dependent solution is obtained in the limit of low
   mutation rates. This solution has the property that the system undergoes
   a rapid transition from a drift-dominated phase to a mutation-dominated
   phase in which the distribution collapses onto the asymptotic stationary
   distribution. The changeover point of the transition is determined by
   the per-generation growth factor and mutation rate. The approximate
   solution is confirmed using numerical simulations. (C) 2017 Elsevier

Abstract = {We study a variant of Hanski's incidence function model that allows
   habitat patch characteristics to vary over time following a Markov
   process. The widely studied case where patches are classified as either
   suitable or unsuitable is included as a special case. For large
   metapopulations, we determine a recursion for the probability that a
   given habitat patch is occupied. This recursion enables us to clarify
   the role of landscape dynamics in the survival of a metapopulation. In
   particular, we show that landscape dynamics affects the persistence and

   the distribution of a local population's life span. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {A new probabilistic model of aging that can be applied to organisms is

Title = {On the use of dense SNP marker data for the identification of distant
   relative pairs},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {107},
Number = {SI},
Pages = {14-25},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {There has been recent interest in the exploitation of readily available
   dense genome scan marker data for the identification of relatives.
   However, there are conflicting findings on how informative these data
   are in practical situations and, in particular, sets of thinned markers
   are often used with no concrete justification for the chosen spacing. We
   explore the potential usefulness of dense single nucleotide polymorphism
   (SNP) arrays for this application with a focus on inferring distant
   relative pairs. We distinguish between relationship estimation, as
   defined by a pedigree connecting the two individuals of interest, and
   estimation of general relatedness as would be provided by a kinship
   coefficient or a coefficient of relatedness. Since our primary interest
   is in the former case, we adopt a pedigree likelihood approach. We
   consider the effect of additional SNPs and data on an additional typed
   relative, together with choice of that relative, on relationship
   inference. We also consider the effect of linkage disequilibrium. When
   overall relatedness, rather than the specific relationship, would
   suffice, we propose an approximate approach that is easy to implement
   and appears to compete well with a popular moment-based estimator and a
   recent maximum likelihood approach based on chromosomal sharing. We
   conclude that denser marker data are more informative for distant
   relatives. However, linkage disequilibrium cannot be ignored and will be
   the main limiting factor for applications to real data. (C) 2015

Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {105},
Pages = {17-23},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Species trees represent the historical divergences of populations or
   species, while gene trees trace the ancestry of individual gene copies
   sampled within those populations. In cases involving rapid speciation,
   gene trees with topologies that differ from that of the species tree can
   be most probable under the standard multispecies coalescent model,
   making species tree inference more difficult. Such anomalous gene trees
   are not well understood except for some small cases. In this work, we
   establish one constraint that applies to trees of any size: gene trees
   with ``caterpillar{''} topologies cannot be anomalous. The proof of this
   involves. a new combinatorial object, called a population history, which
   keeps track of the number of coalescent events in each ancestral
   population. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {The genetic signature of rapid range expansions: How dispersal, growth
   and invasion speed impact heterozygosity and allele surfing},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {98},
Pages = {1-10},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {As researchers collect spatiotemporal population and genetic data in
   tandem, models that connect demography and dispersal to genetics are
   increasingly relevant. The dominant spatiotemporal model of invasion
   genetics is the stepping-stone model which represents a gradual range
   expansion in which individuals jump to uncolonized locations one step at
   a time. However, many range expansions occur quickly as individuals
   disperse far from currently colonized regions. For these types of
   expansion, stepping-stone models are inappropriate. To more accurately
   reflect wider dispersal in many organisms, we created kernel-based
   models of invasion genetics based on integrodifference equations.
   Classic theory relating to integrodifference equations suggests that the
   speed of range expansions is a function of population growth and
   dispersal. In our simulations, populations that expanded at the same
   speed but with spread rates driven by dispersal retained more
   heterozygosity along axes of expansion than range expansions with rates
   of spread that were driven primarily by population growth. To
   investigate surfing we introduced mutant alleles in wave fronts of
   simulated range expansions. In our models based on random mating,
   surfing alleles remained at relatively low frequencies and surfed less
   often compared to previous results based on stepping-stone simulations
   with asexual reproduction. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {A renewal theory approach to IBD sharing},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {97},
Pages = {35-48},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {A long genomic segment inherited by a pair of individuals from a single,
   recent common ancestor is said to be identical-by-descent (IBD). Shared
   IBD segments have numerous applications in genetics, from demographic
   inference to phasing, imputation, pedigree reconstruction, and disease
   mapping. Here, we provide a theoretical analysis of IBD sharing under
   Markovian approximations of the coalescent with recombination. We
   describe a general framework for the IBD process along the chromosome
   under the Markovian models (SMC/SMC'), as well as introduce and justify
   a new model, which we term the renewal approximation, under which
   lengths of successive segments are independent. Then, considering the
   infinite-chromosome limit of the IBD process, we recover previous
   results (for SMC) and derive new results (for SMC') for the mean number
   of shared segments longer than a cutoff and the fraction of the
   chromosome found in such segments. We then use renewal theory to derive
   an expression (in Laplace space) for the distribution of the number of
   shared segments and demonstrate implications for demographic inference.
   We also compute (again, in Laplace space) the distribution of the
   fraction of the chromosome in shared segments, from which we obtain
   explicit expressions for the first two moments. Finally, we generalize
   all results to populations with a variable effective size. (C) 2014

Title = {Stochastic stability and the evolution of coordination in spatially
   structured populations},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {89},
Pages = {75-87},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Animals can often coordinate their actions to achieve mutually
   beneficial outcomes. However, this can result in a social dilemma when
   uncertainty about the behavior of partners creates multiple fitness
   peaks. Strategies that minimize risk ({''}risk dominant{''}) instead of
   maximizing reward ({''}payoff dominant{''}) are favored in economic
   models when individuals learn behaviors that increase their payoffs.
   Specifically, such strategies are shown to be ``stochastically
   stable{''} (a refinement of evolutionary stability).
   Here, we extend the notion of stochastic stability to biological models
   of continuous phenotypes at a mutation-selection-drift balance. This
   allows us to make a unique prediction for long-term evolution in games
   with multiple equilibria. We show how genetic relatedness due to limited
   dispersal and scaled to account for local competition can crucially
   affect the stochastically-stable outcome of coordination games. We find
   that positive relatedness (weak local competition) increases the chance
   the payoff dominant strategy is stochastically stable, even when it is
   not risk dominant. Conversely, negative relatedness (strong local
   competition) increases the chance that strategies evolve that are
   neither payoff nor risk dominant. Extending our results to large
   multiplayer coordination games we find that negative relatedness can
   create competition so extreme that the game effectively changes to a
   hawk-dove game and a stochastically stable polymorphism between the
   alternative strategies evolves. These results demonstrate the usefulness
   of stochastic stability in characterizing long-term evolution of
   continuous phenotypes: the outcomes of multiplayer games can be reduced
   to the generic equilibria of two-player games and the effect of spatial
   structure can be analyzed readily. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {Modeling the effect of changing selective pressures on polymorphism and
   divergence},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {85},
Pages = {73-85},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The most common models of sequence evolution used to make inferences
   about adaptation rely on the assumption that selective pressures at a
   site remain constant through time. Instead, one might plausibly imagine
   that a change in the environment renders an allele beneficial and that
   when it fixes, the site is now constrained-until another change in the
   environment occurs that affects the selective pressures at that site.
   With this view in mind, we introduce a simple dynamic model for the
   evolution of coding regions, in which non-synonymous sites alternate
   between being fixed for the favored allele and being neutral with
   respect to other alleles. We use the pruning algorithm to derive closed
   forms for observable patterns of polymorphism and divergence in terms of
   the model parameters. Using our model, estimates of the fraction of
   beneficial substitutions alpha would remain similar to those obtained
   from existing approaches. In this framework, however, it becomes natural
   to ask how often adaptive substitutions originate from previously
   constrained or previously neutral sites, i.e., about the source of
   adaptive substitutions. We show that counts of coding sites that are
   both polymorphic in a sample from one species and divergent between two
   others carry information about this parameter. We also extend the basic
   model to include the effects of weakly deleterious mutations and discuss
   the importance of assumptions about the distribution of deleterious
   mutations among constrained non-synonymous sites. Finally, we derive a
   likelihood function for the parameters and apply it to a toy example,
   variation data for coding regions from chromosome 2 of the Drosophila
   melanogaster subgroup. This modeling work underscores how restrictive
   assumptions about adaptation have been to date, and how further work in
   this area will help to reveal unexplored and yet basic characteristics
   of adaptation. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

   the transition density of a skew diffusion which appears as a scaling

Volume = {159},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {We introduce a multi-allele Wright-Fisher model with mutation and
   selection such that allele frequencies at a single locus are traced by
   the path of a hybrid jump-diffusion process. The state space of the
   process is given by the vertices and edges of a topological graph, i.e.
   edges are unit intervals. Vertices represent monomorphic population
   states and positions on the edges mark the biallelic proportions of
   ancestral and derived alleles during polymorphic segments. In this
   setting, mutations can only occur at monomorphic loci. We derive the
   stationary distribution in mutation-selection-drift equilibrium and
   obtain the expected allele frequency spectrum under large population
   size scaling. For the extended model with multiple independent loci we
   derive rigorous upper bounds for a wide class of associated measures of
   genetic variation. Within this framework we present mathematically
   precise arguments to conclude that the presence of directional selection
   reduces the magnitude of genetic variation, as constrained by the bounds
   for neutral evolution.},

Title = {The coalescent in finite populations with arbitrary, fixed structure},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {158},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The coalescent is a stochastic process representing ancestral lineages
   in a population undergoing neutral genetic drift. Originally defined for
   a well-mixed population, the coalescent has been adapted in various ways
   to accommodate spatial, age, and class structure, along with other
   features of real-world populations. To further extend the range of
   population structures to which coalescent theory applies, we formulate a
   coalescent process for a broad class of neutral drift models with
   arbitrary - but fixed - spatial, age, sex, and class structure, haploid
   or diploid genetics, and any fixed mating pattern. Here, the coalescent
   is represented as a random sequence of mappings C = (C-t)(t =
   0)(infinity) from a finite set G to itself. The set G represents the
   ``sites{''}(in individuals, in particular locations and/or classes) at
   which these alleles can live. The state of the coalescent, C-t : G -> G
   maps each site g is an element of G to the site containing g's ancestor,
   t time-steps into the past. Using this representation, we define and
   analyze coalescence time, coalescence branch length, mutations prior to
   coalescence, and stationary probabilities of identity-by-descent and
   identity-by-state. For low mutation, we provide a recipe for computing
   identity-by-descent and identity-by-state probabilities via the
   coalescent. Applying our results to a diploid population with arbitrary
   sex ratio r , we find that measures of genetic dissimilarity, among any
   set of sites, are scaled by 4r(1 - r) relative to the even sex ratio
   case.},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {We study the response of a quantitative trait to exponential directional
   selection in a finite haploid population, both at the genetic and the
   phenotypic level. We assume an infinite sites model, in which the number
   of new mutations per generation in the population follows a Poisson
   distribution (with mean Theta) and each mutation occurs at a new,
   previously monomorphic site. Mutation effects are beneficial and drawn
   from a distribution. Sites are unlinked and contribute additively to the
   trait. Assuming that selection is stronger than random genetic drift, we
   model the initial phase of the dynamics by a supercritical Galton-Watson
   process. This enables us to obtain time-dependent results. We show that
   the copy-number distribution of the mutant in generation n, conditioned
   on non-extinction until n, is described accurately by the deterministic
   increase from an initial distribution with mean 1. This distribution is
   related to the absolutely continuous part W+ of the random variable,
   typically denoted W, that characterizes the stochasticity accumulating
   during the mutant's sweep. A suitable transformation yields the
   approximate dynamics of the mutant frequency distribution in a
   Wright-Fisher population of size N. Our expression provides a very
   accurate approximation except when mutant frequencies are close to 1. On
   this basis, we derive explicitly the (approximate) time dependence of
   the expected mean and variance of the trait and of the expected number
   of segregating sites. Unexpectedly, we obtain highly accurate
   approximations for all times, even for the quasi-stationary phase when
   the expected per-generation response and the trait variance have
   equilibrated. The latter refine classical results. In addition, we find
   that Theta is the main determinant of the pattern of adaptation at the
   genetic level, i.e., whether the initial allele-frequency dynamics are
   best described by sweep-like patterns at few loci or small
   allele-frequency shifts at many. The number of segregating sites is an
   appropriate indicator for these patterns. The selection strength
   determines primarily the rate of adaptation. The accuracy of our results
   is tested by comprehensive simulations in a Wright-Fisher framework. We
   argue that our results apply to more complex forms of directional
   selection.},

Title = {A mathematical framework for evo-devo dynamics},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {155},
Pages = {24-50},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Natural selection acts on phenotypes constructed over development, which
   raises the question of how development affects evolution. Classic
   evolutionary theory indicates that development affects evolution by
   modulating the genetic covariation upon which selection acts, thus
   affecting genetic constraints. However, whether genetic constraints are
   relative, thus diverting adaptation from the direction of steepest
   fitness ascent, or absolute, thus blocking adaptation in certain
   directions, remains uncertain. This limits understanding of long-term
   evolution of developmentally constructed phenotypes. Here we formulate a
   general, tractable mathematical framework that integrates age
   progression, explicit development (i.e., the construction of the
   phenotype across life subject to developmental constraints), and
   evolutionary dynamics, thus describing the evolutionary and
   developmental (evo-devo) dynamics. The framework yields simple equations
   that can be arranged in a layered structure that we call the evo-devo
   process, whereby five core elementary components generate all equations
   including those mechanistically describing genetic covariation and the
   evo-devo dynamics. The framework recovers evolutionary dynamic equations
   in gradient form and describes the evolution of genetic covariation from
   the evolution of genotype, phenotype, environment, and mutational
   covariation. This shows that genotypic and phenotypic evolution must be
   followed simultaneously to yield a dynamically sufficient description of
   long-term phenotypic evolution in gradient form, such that evolution
   described as the climbing of a fitness landscape occurs in
   ``geno-phenotype{''}space. Genetic constraints in geno-phenotype space
   are necessarily absolute because the phenotype is related to the
   genotype by development. Thus, the long-term evolutionary dynamics of
   developed phenotypes is strongly non-standard: (1) evolutionary
   equilibria are either absent or infinite in number and depend on genetic
   covariation and hence on development; (2) developmental constraints
   determine the admissible evolutionary path and hence which evolutionary
   equilibria are admissible; and (3) evolutionary outcomes occur at
   admissible evolutionary equilibria, which do not generally occur at
   fitness landscape peaks in geno-phenotype space, but at peaks in the
   admissible evolutionary path where ``total genotypic
   selection{''}vanishes if exogenous plastic response vanishes and
   mutational variation exists in all directions of genotype space. Hence,
   selection and development jointly define the evolutionary outcomes if
   absolute mutational constraints and exogenous plastic response are
   absent, rather than the outcomes being defined only by selection.
   Moreover, our framework provides formulas for the sensitivities of a
   recurrence and an alternative method to dynamic optimization (i.e.,
   dynamic programming or optimal control) to identify evolutionary
   outcomes in models with developmentally dynamic traits. These results
   show that development has major evolutionary effects.},

Title = {Theoretical analysis of principal components in an umbrella model of
   intraspecific evolution},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {148},
Pages = {11-21},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Principal component analysis (PCA) is one of the most frequently-used
   approach to describe population structure from multilocus genotype data.
   Regarding geographic range expansions of modern humans, interpretations
   of PCA have, however, been questioned, as there is uncertainty about the
   wave-like patterns that have been observed in principal components. It
   has indeed been argued that wave-like patterns are mathematical
   artifacts that arise generally when PCA is applied to data in which
   genetic differentiation increases with geographic distance. Here, we
   present an alternative theory for the observation of wave-like patterns
   in PCA. We study a coalescent model - the umbrella model - for the
   diffusion of genetic variants. The model is based on genetic drift
   without any particular geographical structure. In the umbrella model,
   splits from an ancestral population occur almost continuously in time,
   giving birth to small daughter populations at a regular pace. Our
   results provide detailed mathematical descriptions of eigenvalues and
   eigenvectors for the PCA of sampled genomic sequences under the model.
   When variants uniquely represented in the sample are removed, the PCA
   eigenvectors are defined as cosine functions of increasing periodicity,
   reproducing wave-like patterns observed in equilibrium
   isolation-by-distance models. Including singleton variants in the
   analysis, the eigenvectors corresponding to the largest eigenvalues
   exhibit complex wave shapes. The accuracy of our predictions is further
   investigated with coalescent simulations. Our analysis supports the
   hypothesis that highly structured wave-like patterns could arise from
   genetic drift only, and may not always be artificial outcomes of
   spatially structured data. Genomic data related to the peopling of the
   Americas are reanalyzed in the light of our new theory. (c) 2022 The

Title = {Population abundance in predator-prey systems with predator's dispersal

Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {135},
Pages = {1-8},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This paper considers predator-prey systems in which the predator moves
   between two patches. One patch is a source, where the predator and prey
   can persist, while the other is a sink where the predator cannot
   survive. Our aim is to show whether or not the dispersal is beneficial
   to the predator's total abundance at equilibrium. Using dynamical
   systems theory, we demonstrate conditions under which a dispersing
   predator can persist. Our analysis shows that the predator equilibrium
   abundance at intermediate dispersal rates can be higher than that
   without dispersal, while extremely large or small dispersal rates could
   result in predator's extinction. Moreover, we find an explicit
   expression for the total abundance, which clearly shows the role of
   dispersal rates and asymmetry on the predator's abundance. Numerical
   simulations confirm and extend our results. (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All

   points},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {130},
Pages = {143-159},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Quantitative fishery harvest strategies in many countries throughout the
   world are based on maximum sustainable yield (MSY) reference points
   (RPs); in particular, the fishing mortality rate that produces MSY (i.e.
   F-msy) and the population biomass (B-msy) that results from fishing at
   F-msy. There is often great interest in the sensitivity of MSY RPs to
   their inputs and underlying assumptions. We perturb (i.e. omega) inputs
   to generate influence curves which we denote as F-msy(omega) and
   By(omega) as functions of omega. We derive diagnostic equations for the
   slopes of F-msy(omega) and B-msy(omega) at the origin (i.e. no
   perturbation). These equations provide a conceptual understanding of how
   F-msy and B-msy will change in response to changes in inputs, which one
   does not get from a simple computational sensitivity analysis. We show
   that a leading factor determining the sensitivity of F-msy is the amount
   of curvature in the equilibrium yield curve near F-msy. Another leading
   factor affecting the sensitivity of B-msy is if the stock recruitment
   function indicates low density-dependence in recruitment productivity.
   With some exceptions, we find that F-msy will increase if the body
   growth rate or asymptotic size increases, 2) proportions mature increase
   at younger ages, and 3) natural mortality rates decrease and the Ricker
   stock recruitment function is used. If the fishery selectivity function
   of age is monotone increasing then F-msy will also usually increase if
   peak selectivity is shifted to an older age. Usually the signs of the
   slopes for B-msy and F-msy are the same. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {Species exhibit large diversity in their seasonal metabolic patterns
   which are traditionally explained by habitat specific seasonal
   temperature changes and various thermoregulatory adaptations. However,
   due to seasonal changes in resource abundances, density-dependent,
   ecological processes can also be important selective forces shaping the
   evolution of metabolic patterns. In the present theoretical study, the
   combined effect of environmental temperature and resource availability
   on the evolutionarily stable metabolic strategies is investigated in a
   consumer-resource model. Our results suggest that, under a broad range
   of circumstances, density-dependent mechanisms favor the selection of
   active metabolic regulation, where the metabolic rate differs from the
   thermally optimal value. This effect may be temporary, limited only to a
   brief period at seasonal changes, or permanent depending on the implied
   energetic cost and the relative timescale of environmental changes as
   compared to the generation time. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights

   population becomes extinct. Survival of the population may depend on
   which strategy prevails in the game dynamics. Studying cooperative
   dilemmas, it is a natural feature of such a model that cooperators
   enable survival, while defectors drive extinction. Although defectors
   are favored for any mixed population, random drift could lead to their
   elimination and the resulting pure-cooperator population could survive.
   On the other hand, if the defectors remain, then the population will
   quickly go extinct because the frequency of cooperators steadily
   declines and defectors alone cannot survive. In a mutation-selection
   model, we find that (i) a steady supply of cooperators can enable
   long-term population survival, provided selection is sufficiently
   strong, and (ii) selection can increase the abundance of cooperators but
   reduce their relative frequency. Thus, evolutionary game dynamics in
   populations with variable size generate a multifaceted notion of what
   constitutes a trait's long-term success. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {The question as to why most complex organisms reproduce sexually remains
   a very active research area in evolutionary biology. Theories dating
   back to Weismann have suggested that the key may lie in the creation of
   increased variability in offspring, causing enhanced response to
   selection. Under appropriate conditions, selection is known to result in
   the generation of negative linkage disequilibrium, with the effect of
   recombination then being to increase genetic variance by reducing these
   negative associations between alleles. It has therefore been a matter of
   significant interest to understand precisely those conditions resulting
   in negative linkage disequilibrium, and to recognise also the conditions
   in which the corresponding increase in genetic variation will be
   advantageous. Here, we prove rigorous results for the multi-locus case,
   detailing the build up of negative linkage disequilibrium, and
   describing the long term effect on population fitness for models with
   and without bounds on fitness contributions from individual alleles.
   Under the assumption of large but finite bounds on fitness contributions
   from alleles, the non-linear nature of the effect of recombination on a
   population presents serious obstacles in finding the genetic composition
   of populations at equilibrium, and in establishing convergence to those
   equilibria. We describe techniques for analysing the long term behaviour
   of sexual and asexual populations for such models, and use these
   techniques to establish conditions resulting in higher fitnesses for
   sexually reproducing populations. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {113},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Briggs et al. (1993) introduced a host-parasitoid model for the dynamics
   of a system with two parasitoids that attack different juvenile stages
   of a common host. Their main result was that coexistence of the
   parasitoids is only possible when there is sufficient variability in the
   maturation delays of the host juvenile stages. Here, we analyze the
   phenomenon of coexistence in that model more deeply. We show that with
   some distribution families for the maturation delays, the coexistence
   equilibrium is unique, while with other distributions multiple
   coexistence equilibria can be found. In particular, we find that stable
   coexistence does not necessarily require mutual invasibility. (C) 2016

   approach and applications},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {112},
Pages = {70-79},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {An epidemic model with births and deaths is considered on a
   two-dimensional L xL lattice. Each individual can have global infective
   contacts according to the standard susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR)
   model rules or local infective contacts with their nearest neighbors. We
   propose a deterministic approach to this model and, for the parameters
   corresponding to pertussis and rubella in the prevaccine era, verify
   that there is a close agreement with the stochastic simulations when
   epidemic spread or endemic stationarity is considered. We also find that
   our approach captures the characteristic features of the dynamic
   behavior of the system after a sudden decrease in global contacts that
   may arise as a consequence of health care measures. By using the
   deterministic approach, we are able to characterize the exponential
   growth of the epidemic behavior and analyze the stability of the system
   at the stationary values. Since the deterministic approximation captures
   the essential features of the disease transmission dynamics of the
   stochastic model, it provides a useful tool for performing systematic
   studies as a function of the model parameters. We give an example of
   this potentiality by analyzing the likelihood of the endemic state to
   become extinct when the weight of the global contacts is drastically
   reduced. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},

Abstract = {The paper by Ewens and Lessard (2015) adds to the progress that has been
   made in exploring the discrete generation analytical version of Fisher's
   Fundamental Theorem of Natural Selection introduced by Ewens (1989).
   Fisher's continuous-time theorem differs from the version described by
   Ewens and Lessard by using a different concept of fitness. Ewens and
   Lessard use the conventional `viability' concept whereas for Fisher the
   fitness of a genotype was its relative rate of increase or decrease in
   the population. The sole purpose of the present paper is to emphasize
   the alternative inductive nature of Fisher's theorem, as presented by
   him in 1930, by placing it in the context of his contemporary
   development of the analysis of variance in agricultural experiments. It
   is not a general discussion of the theorem itself. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Title = {Estimation of the variance effective population size in age structured
   populations},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {101},
Pages = {9-23},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The variance effective population size for age structured populations is
   generally hard to estimate and the temporal method often gives biased
   estimates. Here, we give an explicit expression for a correction factor
   which, combined with estimates from the temporal method, yield
   approximately unbiased estimates. The calculation of the correction
   factor requires knowledge of the age specific offspring distribution and
   survival probabilities as well as possible correlation between survival
   and reproductive success. In order to relax these requirements, we show
   that only first order moments of these distributions need to be known if
   the time between samples is large, or individuals from all age classes
   which reproduce are sampled. A very explicit approximate expression for
   the asymptotic coefficient of standard deviation of the estimator is
   derived, and it can be used to construct confidence intervals and
   optimal ways of weighting information from different markers. The
   asymptotic coefficient of standard deviation can also be used to design
   studies and we show that in order to maximize the precision for a given
   sample size, individuals from older age classes should be sampled since
   their expected variance of allele frequency change is higher and easier
   to estimate. However, for populations with fluctuating age class sizes,
   the accuracy of the method is reduced when samples are taken from older
   age classes with high demographic variation. We also present a method
   for simultaneous estimation of the variance effective and census
   population size. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.},

Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {99},
Pages = {31-42},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) methods perform inference on
   model-specific parameters of mechanistically motivated parametric models
   when evaluating likelihoods is difficult. Central to the success of ABC
   methods, which have been used frequently in biology, is computationally
   inexpensive simulation of data sets from the parametric model of
   interest. However, when simulating data sets from a model is so
   computationally expensive that the posterior distribution of parameters
   cannot be adequately sampled by ABC, inference is not straightforward.
   We present ``approximate approximate Bayesian computation{''} (AABC), a
   class of computationally fast inference methods that extends ABC to
   models in which simulating data is expensive. In AABC, we first simulate
   a number of data sets small enough to be computationally feasible to
   simulate from the parametric model. Conditional on these data sets, we
   use a statistical model that approximates the correct parametric model
   and enables efficient simulation of a large number of data sets. We show
   that under mild assumptions, the posterior distribution obtained by AABC
   converges to the posterior distribution obtained by ABC, as the number
   of data sets simulated from the parametric model and the sample size of
   the observed data set increase. We demonstrate the performance of AABC
   on a population-genetic model of natural selection, as well as on a
   model of the admixture history of hybrid populations. This latter
   example illustrates how, in population genetics, AABC is of particular
   utility in scenarios that rely on conceptually straightforward but
   potentially slow forward-in-time simulations. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All

Title = {Coalescent simulation in continuous space: Algorithms for large
   neighbourhood size},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {95},
Pages = {13-23},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Many species have an essentially continuous distribution in space, in
   which there are no natural divisions between randomly mating
   subpopulations. Yet, the standard approach to modelling these
   populations is to impose an arbitrary grid of demes, adjusting deme
   sizes and migration rates in an attempt to capture the important
   features of the population. Such indirect methods are required because
   of the failure of the classical models of isolation by distance, which
   have been shown to have major technical flaws. A recently introduced
   model of extinction and recolonisation in two dimensions solves these
   technical problems, and provides a rigorous technical foundation for the
   study of populations evolving in a spatial continuum. The coalescent
   process for this model is simply stated, but direct simulation is very
   inefficient for large neighbourhood sizes. We present efficient and

Title = {A method for estimating the effective number of loci affecting a
   quantitative character},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {89},
Pages = {44-54},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {A likelihood method is introduced that jointly estimates the number of
   loci and the additive effect of alleles that account for the genetic
   variance of a normally distributed quantitative character in a randomly
   mating population. The method assumes that measurements of the character
   are available from one or both parents and an arbitrary number of full
   siblings. The method uses the fact, first recognized by Karl Pearson in
   1904, that the variance of a character among offspring depends on both
   the parental phenotypes and on the number of loci. Simulations show that
   the method performs well provided that data from a sufficient number of
   families (on the order of thousands) are available. This method assumes
   that the loci are in Hardy-Weinberg and linkage equilibrium but does not
   assume anything about the linkage relationships. It performs equally
   well if all loci are on the same non-recombining chromosome provided
   they are in linkage equilibrium. The method can be adapted to take
   account of loci already identified as being associated with the
   ``character of interest. In that case, the method estimates the number
   of loci not already known to affect the character. The method applied to
   measurements of crown-rump length in 281 family trios in a captive
   colony of African green monkeys (Chlorocebus aethiopus sabaeus)
   estimates the number of loci to be 112 and the additive effect to be
   0.26 cm. A parametric bootstrap analysis shows that a rough confidence
   interval has a lower bound of 14 loci. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {Fluctuations in fitness distributions and the effects of weak linked
   selection on sequence evolution},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {85},
Pages = {86-102},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Evolutionary dynamics and patterns of molecular evolution are strongly
   influenced by selection on linked regions of the genome, but our
   quantitative understanding of these effects remains incomplete. Recent
   work has focused on predicting the distribution of fitness within an
   evolving population, and this forms the basis for several methods that
   leverage the fitness distribution to predict the patterns of genetic
   diversity when selection is strong. However, in weakly selected
   populations random fluctuations due to genetic drift are more severe,
   and neither the distribution of fitness nor the sequence diversity
   within the population are well understood. Here, we briefly review the
   motivations behind the fitness-distribution picture, and summarize the
   general approaches that have been used to analyze this distribution in
   the strong-selection regime. We then extend these approaches to the case
   of weak selection, by outlining a perturbative treatment of selection at
   a large number of linked sites. This allows us to quantify the
   stochastic behavior of the fitness distribution and yields exact
   analytical predictions for the sequence diversity and substitution rate
   in the limit that selection is weak. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {Ecological advantages of partial migration as a conditional strategy},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {85},
Pages = {1-11},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Partial migration is a widespread phenomenon characterized by migrant
   and resident forms from the same population. In phenotypically plastic
   taxa with indeterminate growth, resident and migrant ecophenotypes can
   differ in size and life history traits in ways expected to maximize
   fitness in the different habitats they exploit. Studies of partial
   migration in different taxa have advocated either density-dependence or
   environmental stochasticity as explanations for partial migration. We
   used a demographic approach for a virtual Brook Trout population to
   demonstrate the ecological consequences of partial migration under
   interacting density dependence and environmental stochasticity. The
   maintenance of partial migration as a conditional strategy in
   species/populations where resident and migrant forms exhibit life
   history asymmetries provides ecological advantages. We show that
   density-dependent migration is expected to increase population fitness
   under constant environmental conditions or low environmental variation,
   but decreases population fitness under high environmental variation.
   These conditions favor intermediate levels of migration a an
   advantageous tactic. However, there are threshold rates of return
   migration below which partial migration is no longer a viable tactic.
   Our modeling approach also allowed the exploration of the distribution
   of the population by life stage and habitat in response to the strength
   of density dependence, costs of migration, and return rates, and
   demonstrated the importance of the conservation of ecophenotypes in
   partially migratory populations. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {One hundred years of influenza A evolution},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {159},
Pages = {25-34},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Leveraging the simplicity of nucleotide mismatch distributions, we
   provide an intuitive window into the evolution of the human influenza A
   `nonstructural' (NS) gene segment. In an analysis suggested by the
   eminent Danish biologist Freddy B. Christiansen, we illustrate the
   existence of a continuous genetic ``backbone{''}of influenza A NS
   sequences, steadily increasing in nucleotide distance to the 1918 root
   over more than a century. The 2009 influenza A/H1N1 pandemic represents
   a clear departure from this enduring genetic backbone. Utilizing
   nucleotide distance maps and phylogenetic analyses, we illustrate
   remaining uncertainties regarding the origin of the 2009 pandemic,
   highlighting the complexity of influenza evolution. The NS segment is
   interesting precisely because it experiences less pervasive positive
   selection, and departs less strongly from neutral evolution than e.g.
   the HA antigen. Consequently, sudden deviations from neutral
   diversification can indicate changes in other genes via the hitchhiking
   effect. Our approach employs two measures based on nucleotide mismatch
   counts to analyze the evolutionary dynamics of the NS gene segment. The
   rooted Hamming map of distances between a reference sequence and all
   other sequences over time, and the unrooted temporal Hamming
   distribution which captures the distribution of genotypic distances
   between simultaneously circulating viruses, thereby revealing patterns
   of nucleotide diversity and epi-evolutionary dynamics.},

Title = {Amitosis as a strategy of cell division-Insight from the proliferation
   of Tetrahymena thermophila macronuclei},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {145},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Cell division is a necessity of life which can be either mitotic or
   amitotic. While both are fundamental, amitosis is sometimes considered a
   relic of little importance in biology. Nevertheless, eukaryotes often
   have polyploid cells, including cancer cells, which may divide
   amitotically. To understand how amitosis ensures the completion of cell
   division, we turn to the macronuclei of ciliates. The grand scheme
   governing the proliferation of the macronuclei of ciliate cells, which
   involves chromosomal replication and amitosis, is currently unknown,
   which is crucial for developing population genetics model of ciliate
   populations. Using a novel model that encompasses a wide range of
   mechanisms together with experimental data of the composition of mating
   types at different stages derived from a single karyonide of Tetrahymena
   thermophila , we show that the chromosomal replication of the
   macronucleus has a strong head-start effect, with only about five copies
   of chromosomes replicated at a time and persistent reuse of the
   chromosomes involved in the early replication. Furthermore the fission
   of a fully grown macronucleus is non-random with regard to chromosome
   composition, with a strong tendency to push chromosomes and their
   replications to the same daughter cell.(c) 2022 The Author(s). Published

Title = {Survival in branching cellular populations},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {144},
Pages = {13-23},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {We analyze evolutionary dynamics in a confluent, branching cellular
   population, such as in a growing duct, vasculature, or in a branching
   microbial colony. We focus on the coarse-grained features of the
   evolution and build a statistical model that captures the essential
   features of the dynamics. Using simulations and analytic approaches, we
   show that the survival probability of strains within the growing
   population is sensitive to the branching geometry: Branch bifurcations
   enhance survival probability due to an overall population growth (i.e.,
   ``inflation ``), while branch termination and the small effective
   population size at the growing branch tips increase the probability of
   strain extinction. We show that the evolutionary dynamics may be
   captured on a wide range of branch geometries parameterized just by the
   branch diameter N0 and branching rate b. We find that the survival
   probability of neutral cell strains is largest at an ``optimal ``
   branching rate, which balances the effects of inflation and branch
   termination. We find that increasing the selective advantage s of the
   cell strain mitigates the inflationary effect by decreasing the average
   time at which the mutant cell fate is determined. For sufficiently large
   selective advantages, the survival probability of the advantageous
   mutant decreases monotonically with the branching rate. (c) 2022

Title = {Exploring artificial habitat fragmentation to control invasion by
   infectious wildlife diseases},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {141},
Pages = {14-23},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {One way to reduce the impacts of invading wildlife diseases is setting
   up fences that would reduce the spread of pathogens by limiting
   connectivity, similarly to exclusion fences that are commonly used to
   conserve threatened species against invasive predators. One of the
   problems with fences is that, while they may have the short-term benefit
   of impeding the spread of disease, this benefit may be offset by
   potential long-term ecological costs of fragmentation by fencing.
   However, managers facing situations where a pathogen has been detected
   near the habitat of a (highly) vulnerable species may be willing to
   explore such a trade-off. To aid such exploration quantitatively, we
   present a series of models trading off the benefits of fragmentation
   (potential reduction of disease impacts on susceptible individuals)
   against its costs (both financial and ecological, i.e. reduced viability
   in the patches created by fragmentation), and exploring the effects of
   fragmentation on non-target species richness. For all model variants we
   derive the optimal number of artificial patches. We show that
   pre-emptive disease fences may have benefits when the risk of disease
   exceeds the impacts of fragmentation, when fence failure rates are lower
   than a specific threshold, and when sufficient resources are available
   to implement optimal solutions. A useful step to initiate planning is to
   obtain information about the expected number of initial infection events
   and on the host's extinction threshold with respect to the focal habitat
   and management duration. Our approach can assist managers to identify
   whether the trade-offs support the decision to fence and how intensive
   fragmentation should be. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {The distribution of waiting distances in ancestral recombination graphs},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {141},
Pages = {34-43},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The ancestral recombination graph (ARG) contains the full genealogical
   information of the sample, and many population genetic inference
   problems can be solved using inferred or sampled ARGs. In particular,
   the waiting distance between tree changes along the genome can be used
   to make inference about the distribution and evolution of recombination
   rates. To this end, we here derive an analytic expression for the
   distribution of waiting distances between tree changes under the
   sequentially Markovian coalescent model and obtain an accurate
   approximation to the distribution of waiting distances for topology
   changes. We use these results to show that some of the recently proposed
   methods for inferring sequences of trees along the genome provide
   strongly biased distributions of waiting distances. In addition, we
   provide a correction to an undercounting problem facing all available
   ARG inference methods, thereby facilitating the use of ARG inference
   methods to estimate temporal changes in the recombination rate. (C) 2021

Title = {Establishment process of a magic trait allele subject to both divergent
   selection and assortative mating},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {135},
Pages = {9-18},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Sexual selection and divergent selection are among the major driving
   forces of reproductive isolation, which could eventually result in
   speciation. A magic trait is defined such that a single trait is subject
   to both divergent selection and mate choice through phenotype-based
   assortative mating. We are here interested in the evolutionary behavior
   of alleles at a genetic locus responsible for a magic trait in a finite
   population. We assume that, in a pair of homogeneous subpopulations, a
   mutant allele arises at the magic trait locus, and theoretically obtain
   the probability that the new allele establishes in the population, or
   the establishment probability. We also show an analytical expression for
   the trajectory of allele frequency along the establishment, from which
   the time required for the establishment is obtained, or the
   establishment time. Under this model, divergent selection simply favors
   the new allele to fix where it is beneficial, whereas assortative mating
   works against rare alleles. It is theoretically demonstrated that the
   fate of the new allele is determined by the relative contributions of
   the two selective forces, divergent selection and assortative mating,
   when the allele is rare so that the two selective forces counteract. Our
   theoretical results for the establishment probability and time allow us
   to understand the relative role of random genetic drift in the
   establishment process of a magic trait allele in a finite population.

Title = {Adaptive walks on high-dimensional fitness landscapes and seascapes with
   distance-dependent statistics},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {130},
Pages = {13-49},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The dynamics of evolution is intimately shaped by epistasis interactions
   between genetic elements which cause the fitness-effect of combinations
   of mutations to be non-additive. Analyzing evolutionary dynamics that
   involves large numbers of epistatic mutations is intrinsically
   difficult. A crucial feature is that the fitness landscape in the
   vicinity of the current genome depends on the evolutionary history. A
   key step is thus developing models that enable study of the effects of
   past evolution on future evolution. In this work, we introduce a broad
   class of high-dimensional random fitness landscapes for which the
   correlations between fitnesses of genomes are a general function of
   genetic distance. Their Gaussian character allows for tractable
   computational as well as analytic understanding. We study the properties
   of these landscapes focusing on the simplest evolutionary process:
   random adaptive (uphill) walks. Conventional measures of
   ``ruggedness{''} are shown to not much affect such adaptive walks.
   Instead, the long-distance statistics of epistasis cause all properties
   to be highly conditional on past evolution, determining the statistics
   of the local landscape (the distribution of fitness-effects of available
   mutations and combinations of these), as well as the global geometry of
   evolutionary trajectories. In order to further explore the effects of
   conditioning on past evolution, we model the effects of slowly changing
   environments. At long times, such fitness ``seascapes{''} cause a
   statistical steady state with highly intermittent evolutionary dynamics:
   populations undergo bursts of rapid adaptation, interspersed with
   periods in which adaptive mutations are rare and the population waits
   for more new directions to be opened up by changes in the environment.
   Finally, we discuss prospects for studying more complex evolutionary
   dynamics and on broader classes of high-dimensional landscapes and
   seascapes. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {In this paper we study spatially clustered distribution of individuals

   extends previous works on Malecot theory of isolation by distance. We
   reformulate Shimatani model of replicated Neyman-Scott process to allow
   for a general dispersal kernel function and we show that the random
   migration hypothesis can be substituted by the long dispersal distance
   property of the kernel. Moreover, the extended framework presented here
   is fit to handle spatially explicit statistical estimators of genetic
   variability like Moran autocorrelation index or Sorensen similarity
   index. We discuss the pivotal role of the choice of dispersal kernel for
   the above estimators in a toy model of dynamic population genetics
   theory. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

   destruction. We use a family of models to probe the causes of the
   contrasting responses of these two types of species to habitat
   destruction. Our approach allows a number of mechanisms to be switched
   on and off, thereby making it possible to study their marginal and joint
   effects. Unlike many previous models, we do not assume any intrinsic
   competitive asymmetry between the species, and we assume pre-emptive
   rather than displacement competition. Under these assumptions, in the
   mean-field model the prevalences of all species decrease monotonically
   with decreasing habitat availability, independently of the degree of
   specialization. However, in the stochastic and spatial individual-based
   simulations of the same model, the specialists dominate in landscapes of
   high quality, whereas generalists thrive in landscapes of intermediate
   quality; no species persist in very poor landscapes. The same pattern
   also occurs in a non-spatial stochastic model but not in a deterministic
   spatial model, showing that demographic stochasticity plays a key role
   in shaping the outcome of competitive interactions. (C) 2018 Published

Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},

Abstract = {Because the Lotka-Volterra competitive equations posit no specific
   competitive mechanisms, they are exceedingly general, and can
   theoretically approximate any underlying mechanism of competition near
   equilibrium. In practice, however, these models rarely generate accurate
   predictions in diverse communities. We propose that this difference
   between theory and practice may be caused by how uncertainty propagates
   through Lotka-Volterra systems. In approximating mechanistic
   relationships with Lotka-Volterra models, associations among parameters
   are lost, and small variation can correspond to large and unrealistic
   changes in predictions. We demonstrate that constraining Lotka-Volterra
   models using correlations among parameters expected from hypothesized
   underlying mechanisms can reintroduce some of the underlying structure
   imposed by those mechanisms, thereby improving model predictions by both
   reducing bias and increasing precision. Our results suggest that this
   hybrid approach may combine some of the generality of phenomenological
   models with the broader applicability and meaningful interpretability of
   mechanistic approaches. These methods could be useful in poorly
   understood systems for identifying important coexistence mechanisms, or
   for making more accurate predictions. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {Interplay between habitat subdivision and minimum resource requirement
   in two-species competition},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {120},
Pages = {90-102},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This paper explores the effects of increasing spatial subdivision of
   habitat on competition between two species. An increase in the degree of
   subdivision without any increase in the total amount of resources in the
   environment leads to smaller patch sizes, and thus, fewer individuals
   supported per patch. This fact suggests that when the degree of
   subdivision is high, the minimum resources that an individual must
   obtain before reproduction become important. Competition equations
   derived from first-principles that incorporate the minimum resource
   requirement are employed to investigate the effects of spatial
   subdivision and how these effects depend on the minimum requirements of
   the two species, type of resource competition such as scramble or
   contest, and spatial aggregation level of individuals. The results show
   that increased subdivision leads to changes in ``effective
   fecundities{''} of the species, and consequently, affects their
   competitive superiority. Species coexistence is promoted at intermediate
   subdivision levels, especially if there is a trade-off between the
   minimum resource requirement and inherent fecundity. The range of
   subdivision in which coexistence occurs depends on the spatial
   aggregation of individuals and inequality in competitive ability between
   the species. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Estimating the basic reproductive number during the early stages of an
   emerging epidemic},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {119},
Pages = {26-36},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {A novel outbreak will generally not be detected until such a time that
   it has become established. When such an outbreak is detected, public
   health officials must determine the potential of the outbreak, for which
   the basic reproductive number R-0 is an important factor. However, it is
   often the case that the resulting estimate of R-0 is positively-biased
   for a number of reasons. One commonly overlooked reason is that the
   outbreak was not detected until such a time that it had become
   established, and therefore did not experience initial fade out. We
   propose a method which accounts for this bias by conditioning the
   underlying epidemic model on becoming established and demonstrate that
   this approach leads to a less biased estimate of R-0 during the early
   stages of an outbreak. We also present a computationally-efficient
   approximation scheme which is suitable for large data sets in which the
   number of notified cases is large. This methodology is applied to an
   outbreak of pandemic influenza in Western Australia, recorded in 2009.

Title = {Unlimited niche packing in a Lotka-Volterra competition game},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {116},
Pages = {1-17},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {A central question in the study of ecology and evolution is: ``Why are
   there so many species?{''} It has been shown that certain forms of the
   Lotka-Volterra (L-V) competition equations lead to an unlimited number
   of species. Furthermore, these authors note how any change in the nature
   of competition (the competition kernel) leads to a finite or small
   number of coexisting species. Here we build upon these works by further
   investigating the L-V model of unlimited niche packing as a reference
   model and evolutionary game for understanding the environmental factors
   restricting biodiversity. We also examine the combined eco-evolutionary
   dynamics leading up to the species diversity and traits of the ESS
   community in both unlimited and finite niche-pacldng versions of the
   model. As an L-V game with symmetric competition, we let the strategies
   of individuals determine the strength of the competitive interaction
   (like competes most with like) and also the carrying capacity of the
   population. We use a mixture of analytic proofs (for one and two species
   systems) and numerical simulations. For the model of unlimited niche
   packing, we show that a finite number of species will evolve to specific
   convergent stable minima of the adaptive landscape (also known as
   species archetypes). Starting with a single species, faunal buildup can
   proceed either through species doubling as each diversity-specific set
   of minima are reached, or through the addition of species one-by-one by
   randomly assigning a speciation event to one of the species. Either way
   it is possible for an unlimited number or species to evolve and coexist.
   We examine two simple and biologically likely ways for breaking the
   unlimited niche-packing: (1) some minimum level of competition among
   species, and (2) constrain the fundamental niche of the trait space to a
   finite interval. When examined under both ecological and evolutionary
   dynamics, both modifications result in convergent stable ESSs with a
   finite number of species. When the number of species is held below the
   number of species in an ESS coalition, we see a diverse array of
   convergent stable niche archetypes that consist of some species at
   maxima and some at minima of the adaptive landscape. Our results support
   those of others and suggest that instead of focusing on why there are so
   many species we might just as usefully ask, why are there so few
   species? (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {An alternative derivation of the stationary distribution of the
   multivariate neutral Wright-Fisher model for low mutation rates with a
   view to mutation rate estimation from site frequency data},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {114},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Recently, Burden and Tang (2016) provided an analytical expression for
   the stationary distribution of the multivariate neutral Wright-Fisher
   model with low mutation rates. In this paper we present a simple,
   alternative derivation that illustrates the approximation. Our proof is
   based on the discrete multivariate boundary mutation model which has
   three key ingredients. First, the decoupled Moran model is used to
   describe genetic drift. Second, low mutation rates are assumed by
   limiting mutations to monomorphic states. Third, the mutation rate
   matrix is separated into a time-reversible part and a flux part, as
   suggested by Burden and Tang (2016). An application of our result to
   data from several great apes reveals that the assumption of stationarity
   may be inadequate or that other evolutionary forces like selection or
   biased gene conversion are acting. Furthermore we find that the model
   with a reversible mutation rate matrix provides a reasonably good fit to
   the data compared to the one with a non-reversible mutation rate matrix.

Abstract = {Under the coalescent model, the random number n(t) of lineages ancestral
   to a sample is nearly deterministic as a function of time when n(t) is
   moderate to large in value, and it is well approximated by its
   expectation E{[}n(t)]. In turn, this expectation is well approximated by
   simple deterministic functions that are easy to compute. Such
   deterministic functions have been applied to estimate allele age,
   effective population size, and genetic diversity, and they have been
   used to study properties of models of infectious disease dynamics.
   Although a number of simple approximations of E{[}n(t)] have been
   derived and applied to problems of population-genetic inference, the
   theoretical accuracy of the resulting approximate formulas and the
   inferences obtained using these approximations is not known, and the
   range of problems to which they can be applied is not well understood.
   Here, we demonstrate general procedures by which the approximation n(t)
   approximate to E{[}n(t)] can be used to reduce the computational
   complexity of coalescent formulas, and we show that the resulting
   approximations converge to their true values under simple assumptions.
   Such approximations provide alternatives to exact formulas that are
   computationally intractable or numerically unstable when the number of
   sampled lineages is moderate or large. We also extend an existing class
   of approximations of E{[}n(t)] to the case of multiple populations of
   time-varying size with migration among them. Our results facilitate the
   use of the deterministic approximation n(t) approximate to E{[}n(t)] for
   deriving functionally simple, computationally efficient, and numerically
   stable approximations of coalescent formulas under complicated
   demographic scenarios. (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Correlation between relatives given complete genotypes: From identity by
   descent to identity by function},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {88},
Pages = {57-67},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {In classical quantitative genetics, the correlation between the
   phenotypes of individuals with unknown genotypes and a known pedigree
   relationship is expressed in terms of probabilities of IBD states. In
   existing approaches to the inverse problem where genotypes are observed
   but pedigree relationships are not, dependence between phenotypes is
   either modeled as Bayesian uncertainty or mapped to an IBD model via
   inferred relatedness parameters. Neither approach yields a relationship
   between genotypic similarity and phenotypic similarity with a
   probabilistic interpretation corresponding to a generative model. We
   introduce a generative model for diploid allele effect based on the
   classic infinite allele mutation process. This approach motivates the
   concept of IBF (Identity by Function). The phenotypic covariance between
   two individuals given their diploid genotypes is expressed in terms of
   functional identity states. The IBF parameters define a genetic
   architecture for a trait without reference to specific alleles or
   population. Given full genome sequences, we treat a gene-scale
   functional region, rather than a SNP, as a QTL, modeling patterns of
   dominance for multiple alleles. Applications demonstrated by simulation
   include phenotype and effect prediction and association, and estimation
   of heritability and classical variance components. A simulation case
   study of the Missing Heritability problem illustrates a decomposition of
   heritability under the IBF framework into Explained and Unexplained
   components. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {The ancestral selection graph under strong directional selection},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {87},
Pages = {25-33},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The ancestral selection graph (ASG) was introduced by Neuhauser and
   Krone (1997) in order to study populations of constant size which evolve
   under selection. Coalescence events, which occur at rate 1 for every
   pair of lines, lead to joint ancestry. In addition, splitting events in
   the ASG at rate alpha, the scaled selection coefficient, produce
   possible ancestors, such that the real ancestor depends on the ancestral
   alleles. Here, we use the ASG in the case without mutation in order to
   study fixation of a beneficial mutant. Using our main tool, a
   reversibility property of the ASG, we provide a new proof of the fact
   that a beneficial allele fixes roughly in time (2 log alpha)/alpha if
   alpha is large. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Impact of stochasticity in immigration and reintroduction on colonizing
   and extirpating populations},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {85},
Pages = {38-48},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {A thorough quantitative understanding of populations at the edge of
   extinction is needed to manage both invasive and extirpating
   populations. Immigration can govern the population dynamics when the
   population levels are low. It increases the probability of a population
   establishing (or reestablishing) before going extinct (EBE). However,
   the rate of immigration can be highly fluctuating. Here, we investigate
   how the stochasticity in immigration impacts the EBE probability for
   small populations in variable environments. We use a population model
   with an Allee effect described by a stochastic differential equation
   (SDE) and employ the Fokker-Planck diffusion approximation to quantify
   the EBE probability. We find that, the effect of the stochasticity in
   immigration on the EBE probability depends on both the intrinsic growth
   rate (r) and the mean rate of immigration (p). In general, if r is large
   and positive (e.g. invasive species introduced to favorable habitats),
   or if p is greater than the rate of population decline due to the
   demographic Allee effect (e.g., effective stocking of declining
   populations), then the stochasticity in immigration decreases the EBE
   probability. If r is large and negative (e.g. endangered populations in
   unfavorable habitats), or if the rate of decline due to the demographic
   Allee effect is much greater than p (e.g., weak stocking of declining
   populations), then the stochasticity in immigration increases the EBE
   probability. However, the mean time for EBE decreases with the
   increasing stochasticity in immigration with both positive and negative
   large r. Thus, results suggest that ecological management of populations
   involves a tradeoff as to whether to increase or decrease the
   stochasticity in immigration in order to optimize the desired outcome.
   Moreover, the control of invasive species spread through stochastic
   means, for example, by stochastic monitoring and treatment of vectors
   such as ship-ballast water, may be suitable strategies given the
   environmental and demographic uncertainties at introductions. Similarly,
   the recovery of declining and extirpated populations through stochastic
   stocking, translocation, and reintroduction, may also be suitable
   strategies. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Duality and the well-posedness of a martingale problem},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {159},
Pages = {59-73},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {For two Polish state spaces E-X and E-Y, and an operator G(X), we obtain
   existence and uniqueness of a G(X-) martingale problem provided there is
   a bounded continuous duality function E-X x E-Y together with a dual
   process Y on E-Y which is the unique solution of a G(Y)-martingale
   problem. For the corresponding solutions (X-t)(t >= 0) and (Y-t)(t >=
   0), duality with respect to a function H in its simplest form means that
   the relation E-x{[}H (X-t, y)] = E-y{[}H (x, Y-t)] holds for all (x, y)
   is an element of E-X x E-Y and t >= 0. While duality is well-known to
   imply uniqueness of the G(X)-martingale problem, we give here a set of
   conditions under which duality also implies existence without using
   approximating sequences of processes of a different kind (e.g. jump
   processes to approximate diffusions) which is a widespread strategy for
   proving existence of solutions of martingale problems. Given the process
   (Yt)(t >= 0) and a duality function H, to prove existence of (X-t)(t >=
   0) one has to show that the r.h.s. of the duality relation defines for
   each y a measure on E-X, i.e. there are transition kernels (mu(t))(t >=
   0) from E-X to E-X such that Ey{[}H(x, Yt)] = integral mu(t)(x, dx') H
   (x' y) for all (x, y) is an element of E-X x E-Y and all t >= 0.
   As examples, we treat resampling and branching models, such as the
   Fleming-Viot measure-valued diffusion and its spatial counterparts (with
   both, discrete and continuum space), as well as branching systems, such
   as Feller's branching diffusion. While our main result as well as all
   examples come with (locally) compact state spaces, we discuss the
   strategy to lift our results to genealogy-valued processes or historical
   processes, leading to non-compact (discrete and continuum) state spaces.
   Such applications will be tackled in forthcoming work based on the
   present article.},

Title = {Persistence in repeated games encourages the evolution of spite},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {158},
Pages = {109-120},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Social behavior is divided into four types: altruism, spite, mutualism,
   and selfishness. The former two are costly to the actor; therefore, from
   the perspective of natural selection, their existence can be regarded as
   mysterious. One potential setup which encourages the evolution of
   altruism and spite is repeated interaction. Players can behave
   conditionally based on their opponent's previous actions in the repeated
   interaction. On the one hand, the retaliatory strategy (who behaves
   altruistically when their opponent behaved altruistically and behaves
   nonaltruistically when the opponent player behaved non-altruistically)
   is likely to evolve when players choose altruistic or selfish behavior
   in each round. On the other hand, the anti-retaliatory strategy (who is
   spiteful when the opponent was not spiteful and is not spiteful when the
   opponent player was spiteful) is likely to evolve when players opt for
   spiteful or mutualistic behavior in each round. These successful
   conditional behaviors can be favored by natural selection. Here, we
   notice that information on opponent players' actions is not always
   available. When there is no such information, players cannot determine
   their behavior according to their opponent's action. By investigating
   the case of altruism, a previous study (Kurokawa, 2017, Mathematical
   Biosciences, 286, 94-103) found that persistent altruistic strategies,
   which choose the same action as the own previous action, are favored by
   natural selection. How, then, should a spiteful conditional strategy
   behave when the player does not know what their opponent did? By
   studying the repeated game, we find that persistent spiteful strategies,
   which choose the same action as the own previous action, are favored by
   natural selection. Altruism and spite differ concerning whether
   retaliatory or anti-retaliatory strategies are favored by natural
   selection; however, they are identical concerning whether persistent
   strategies are favored by natural selection.},

Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {157},
Pages = {55-85},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In this article, discrete and stochastic changes in (effective)
   population size are incorporated into the spectral representation of a
   biallelic diffusion process for drift and small mutation rates. A
   forward algorithm inspired by Hidden-Markov-Model (HMM) literature is
   used to compute exact sample allele frequency spectra for three
   demographic scenarios: single changes in (effective) population size,
   boom -bust dynamics, and stochastic fluctuations in (effective)
   population size. An approach for fully agnostic demographic inference
   from these sample allele spectra is explored, and sufficient statistics
   for stepwise changes in population size are found. Further, convergence
   behaviours of the polymorphic sample spectra for population size changes
   on different time scales are examined and discussed within the context
   of inference of the effective population size. Joint visual assessment
   of the sample spectra and the temporal coefficients of the spectral
   decomposition of the forward diffusion process is found to be important
   in determining departure from equilibrium. Stochastic changes in
   (effective) population size are shown to shape sample spectra
   particularly strongly.},

Title = {Conformity and content-biased cultural transmission in the evolution of
   altruism},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {143},
Pages = {52-61},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The evolution of altruism has been extensively modeled under the
   assumption of genetic transmission, whereas the dynamics under cultural
   transmission are less well understood. Previous research has shown that
   cultural transmission can facilitate the evolution of altruism by
   increasing (1) the probability of adopting the altruistic phenotype, and
   (2) assortment between altruists. We incorporate vertical and oblique
   transmission, which can be conformist or anti-conformist, into models of
   parental care, sibling altruism, and altruism between individuals that
   meet assortatively. If oblique transmission is conformist, it becomes
   easier for altruism to invade a population of non-altruists as the
   probability of vertical transmission increases. If oblique transmission
   is anti-conformist, decreasing vertical transmission facilitates
   invasion by altruism in the assortative meeting model, whereas in other
   models, there is a trade-off: greater vertical transmission produces
   greater assortment among genetically related altruists, but lowers the
   probability of adopting altruism via anti-conformity. Compared to
   conditions for invasion under genetic transmission, e.g., Hamilton's
   rule, we show that invasion can be easier with sufficiently strong
   anti-conformity, and in some models, with sufficiently high assortment
   even if oblique transmission is conformist. We also explore invasion by
   an allele A that increases individuals' content bias for altruism, in
   the absence of other forms of cultural transmission. If costs and
   benefits combine additively, A invades under previously known
   conditions. If costs and benefits combine multiplicatively, invasion by
   A and by altruism become more difficult than in the corresponding
   additive models. (C) 2021 The Author( s). Published by Elsevier Inc.},

Title = {Improving pest monitoring networks using a simulation-based approach to
   contribute to pesticide reduction},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {141},
Pages = {24-33},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Conventional pest management mainly relies on the use of pesticides.
   However, the negative externalities of pesticides are now well known.
   More sustainable practices, such as Integrated Pest Management, are
   necessary to limit crop damage from pathogens, pests and weeds in
   agroecosystems. Reducing pesticide use requires information to determine
   whether chemical treatments are really needed. Pest monitoring networks
   (PMNs) are key contributors to this information. However, the
   effectiveness of a PMN in delivering relevant information about pests
   depends on its spatial sampling resolution and its memory length. The
   trade-off between the monitoring efforts and the usefulness of the
   information provided is highly dependent on pest ecological traits, the
   damage they can cause (in terms of crop losses), and economic drivers
   (production costs, agriculture product prices and incentives). Due to
   the high complexity of optimising PMNs, we have developed a theoretical
   model that belongs to the family of Dynamic Bayesian Networks in order
   to compare several PMNs performances. This model links the
   characteristics of a PMN to treatment decisions and the resulting pest
   dynamics. Using simulation and inference tools for graphical models, we
   derived the proportion of impacted fields, the number of pesticide
   treatments and the overall gross margins for three types of pest with
   contrasting levels of endocyclism. The term ``endocyclic'' refers to an
   organism whose development is mostly restricted to a field and highly
   depends on the inoculum present in the considered field. The presence of
   purely endocyclic pests at a given time increases the probability of
   reoccurrence. Conversely, slightly endocyclic pests have a low
   persistence. The simulation analysis considered ten scenarios: an
   expected margin-based strategy with a spatial resolution of four PMNs
   and two memory lengths (one year or eight years), as well as two extreme
   crop protection strategies (systematic treatments on all fields and
   systematic no treatment). For purely and mainly endocyclic pests (e.g.
   soil-borne pathogens and most weeds, respectively), we found that
   increasing the spatial resolution of PMNs made it possible to
   significantly decrease the number of treatments required for pest
   control. Taking past observations into account was also effective, but
   to a lesser extent. PMN information had virtually no influence on the
   control of non-endocyclic pests (such as flying insects or airborne
   plant pathogens) which may be due to the spatial coverage addressed in
   our study. The next step is to extend the analysis of PMNs and to
   integrate the information generated by PMNs into sustainable pest
   management strategies, both at the field and the landscape level. (C)

Title = {Character displacement in the presence of multiple trait differences:
   Evolution of the storage effect in germination and growth},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {140},
Pages = {54-66},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Ecological character displacement is a prominent hypothesis for the
   maintenance of ecological differences between species that are critical
   to stable coexistence. Models of character displacement often ascribe
   interspecific competitive interactions to a single character, but
   multiple characters contribute to competition, and their effects on
   selection can be nonadditive. Focusing on one character, we ask if other
   characters that affect competition alter evolutionary outcomes for the
   focal character. We address this question using the variable environment
   seed bank model for two species with two traits. The focal trait is the
   temporal pattern of germination, which is evolutionary labile. The other
   trait is the temporal pattern of plant growth, which is assumed fixed.
   We ask whether evolutionary divergence of germination patterns between
   species depends on species differences in plant growth. Patterns of
   growth can affect selection on germination patterns in two ways. First,
   cues present at germination can provide information about future growth.
   Second, germination and growth jointly determine the biomass of plants,
   which determines demand for resources. Germination and growth contribute
   to the selection gradient in distinct components, one
   density-independent and the other density-dependent. Importantly, the
   relative strengths of the components are key. When the density-dependent
   component is stronger, displacement in germination patterns between
   species is larger. Stronger cues at germination strengthen the
   density-independent component by increasing the benefits of germinating
   in years of favorable growth. But cues also affect the density dependent
   component by boosting a species' biomass, and hence its competitive
   effect, in good years. Consequently, cues weaken character displacement
   when growth patterns are similar for two competitors, but favor
   displacement when growth patterns are species-specific. Understanding
   how these selection components change between contexts can help
   understand the origin and maintenance of species differences in
   germination patterns in temporally fluctuating environments. (C) 2021

Title = {A temporal model of territorial defence with antagonistic interactions},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {134},
Pages = {15-35},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Territorial behaviour is an important part of the lives of many animals.
   Once a territory has been acquired, an animal may spend its entire life
   on it, and may have to repeatedly defend it from conspecifics. Some
   species make great investments in the defence of a territory, and this
   defence can be costly, in terms of time, energy and risk of injury. Time
   costs in particular have rarely been explicitly factored into such
   models. In this paper we consider a model of territorial defence which
   includes both population dynamic and time delay elements, building upon
   recent advances in time constraint models. Populations may divide into
   two distinct types, where one type makes no effort to control
   territories. We shall call this type nomads, and the other type
   territorials. Here the territory owners must divide their time between
   patrolling and foraging, and this balance is their only strategic
   decision. We show how to find the evolutionarily stable patrolling
   strategy and the population composition of territorials and nomads, and
   consider some examples demonstrating key situations. We see that both
   time constraints and population density pressure are crucial to
   influencing behaviour. In particular we find cases with both territorial
   individuals and nomads where a mixed, either pure or both pure
   patrolling strategies are evolutionarily stable. In different conditions
   either nomads or territorials can be absent, and indeed for a
   significant range of parameter combinations the population can exhibit
   tristability, with three distinct ecologically stable population
   compositions: with both nomads and territorials, only nomads or only
   territorials. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {When do factors promoting genetic diversity also promote population
   persistence? A demographic perspective on Gillespie's SAS-CFF model},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {133},
Pages = {141-149},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Classical stochastic demography predicts that environmental
   stochasticity reduces population growth rates and, thereby, can increase
   extinction risk. In contrast, in a 1978 Theoretical Population Biology
   paper, Gillespie demonstrated with his stochastic additive scale and
   concave fitness function (SAS-CFF) model that environmental
   stochasticity can promote genetic diversity. Extending the SAS-CFF to
   account for demography, I examine the simultaneous effects of
   environmental stochasticity on genetic diversity and population
   persistence. Explicit expressions for the per-capita growth rates of
   rare alleles and the population at low-density are derived. Consistent
   with Gillespie's analysis, if the log-fitness function is concave and
   allelic responses to the environment are not perfectly correlated, then
   per-capita growth rates of rare alleles are positive and genetic
   diversity is maintained in the sense of stochastic persistence i.e.
   allelic frequencies tend to stay away from zero almost-surely and in
   probability. Alternatively, if the log-fitness function is convex, then
   per-capita growth rates of rare alleles are negative and an allele
   asymptotically fixates with probability one. If the population's
   low-density, per-capita growth rate is positive, then the population
   persists in the sense of stochastic persistence, else it goes
   asymptotically extinct with probability one. In contrast to per-capita
   growth rates of rare alleles, the population's per-capita growth rate is
   a decreasing function of the concavity of the log-fitness function.
   Moreover, when the log-fitness function is concave, allelic diversity
   increases the population's per-capita growth rate while decreasing the
   per-capita growth rate of rare alleles; when the log-fitness function is
   convex, environmental stochasticity decreases the per-capita growth rate
   of rare alleles, but increases the population's per-capita growth rate.
   Collectively, these results (i) highlight how mechanisms promoting
   population persistence may be at odds with mechanisms promoting genetic
   diversity, and (ii) provide conditions under which population
   persistence relies on existing standing genetic variation. (C) 2019

Title = {Enhancing population stability with combined adaptive limiter control
   and finding the optimal harvesting-restocking balance},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {130},
Pages = {1-12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Fluctuations in population size may have negative consequences (e.g., an
   increased risk of extinction or the occurrence of repeated outbreaks),
   and many management strategies are aimed at avoiding them by either only
   restocking or only harvesting the population. Two of these strategies
   are adaptive limiter control (ALC) and adaptive threshold harvesting
   (ATH). With ALC the population is controlled by only restocking and with
   ATH by only harvesting. We propose the strategy of combined adaptive
   limiter control (CALC) as the combination of ALC and ATH and study the
   potential advantages of CALC over ALC and ATH. We consider two different
   population models, namely a stochastic overcompensatory model and a
   host-pathogen-predator model. For the first model, our results show that
   the combination of restocking and harvesting under CALC improves the
   constancy stability of the managed populations when the harvesting and
   restocking intensities are high enough. Otherwise the effect is marginal
   or in rare cases negative. For the second model, we show that combining
   harvesting with restocking reduces the outbreak risk only if the
   harvesting intensity is low. For medium harvesting intensities the
   effect is marginal and for high harvesting intensities the risk of
   outbreaks is increased. In addition, we study the optimal
   harvesting-restocking balance by considering a proxy of the benefit
   obtained in terms of the reduction in the outbreak risk and the
   harvesting and restocking costs. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {Fitting Markovian binary trees using global and individual demographic
   data},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {128},
Pages = {39-50},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {We consider a class of continuous-time branching processes called
   Markovian binary trees (MBTs), in which the individuals lifetime and
   reproduction epochs are modelled using a transient Markovian arrival
   process (TMAP). We develop methods for estimating the parameters of the
   TMAP by using either age-specific averages of reproduction and mortality
   rates, or age-specific individual demographic data. Depending on the
   degree of detail of the available information, we follow a weighted
   non-linear regression or a maximum likelihood approach. We discuss
   several criteria to determine the optimal number of states in the
   underlying TMAP. Our results improve the fit of an existing MBT model
   for human demography, and provide insights for the future conservation
   management of the threatened Chatham Island black robin population. (C)

Title = {A generalization of the informational view of non-random mating: Models
   with variable population frequencies},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {125},
Pages = {67-74},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The mating distribution caused by mate choice can be expressed as a gain
   in information with respect to random mating. In that view, the
   population phenotype frequencies had been considered constant during the
   breeding season. Here, such restriction was relaxed to consider
   encounter-mating processes in which first, the encounter between
   partners depends on the phenotype distribution of the population, and
   second, the mating after the encounter depends on the mutual mating
   propensities. Under this setting, the population phenotype frequencies
   are no longer constant because the process of pair formation occurs in
   discrete intervals of time, called mating rounds where at least one
   mating pair is formed, and the frequency of phenotypes available for the
   next mating, changes. Provided that there are more than one mating round
   per breeding season, the population phenotype frequencies are no longer
   constant.
   Similarly to the constant case, we describe the change in the mating
   phenotypes by the flow of information with respect to random mating.
   This information can be partitioned into sexual selection, assortative
   mating (sexual isolation) and their mixed effect. Likewise, the pairwise
   statistics for total change, sexual selection and assortative mating are
   generalized for variable population phenotype frequencies.
   The new tests had more power to detect the effects of non-random mating
   when the phenotype frequencies varied during the breeding season. The
   differences in power were high for sexual selection but minor for
   assortative mating scenarios. However, the application of the new
   formulas requires the estimation of phenotype frequencies at each mating
   round. Therefore, choosing one or another type of statistics would
   depend on the biological scenario as well as the availability and
   easiness to split the sampling in more than one mating round. (C) 2018

   evolutionary game theory (Nowak et al., 2004) and effects of stochastic
   slowdown (Altrock and Traulsen, 2009). Since similar effects are of
   interest in other application areas, we formulate our results for

Title = {Ecological change points: The strength of density dependence and the
   loss of history},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {121},
Pages = {45-59},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Change points in the dynamics of animal abundances have extensively been
   recorded in historical time series records. Little attention has been
   paid to the theoretical dynamic consequences of such change points. Here
   we propose a change-point model of stochastic population dynamics. This
   investigation embodies a shift of attention from the problem of
   detecting when a change will occur, to another non-trivial puzzle: using
   ecological theory to understand and predict the post-breakpoint behavior
   of the population dynamics. The proposed model and the explicit
   expressions derived here predict and quantify how density dependence
   modulates the influence of the pre-breakpoint parameters into the
   post-breakpoint dynamics. Time series transitioning from one stationary
   distribution to another contain information about where the process was
   before the change-point, where is it heading and how long it will take
   to transition, and here this information is explicitly stated.
   Importantly, our results provide a direct connection of the strength of
   density dependence with theoretical properties of dynamic systems, such
   as the concept of resilience. Finally, we illustrate how to harness such
   information through maximum likelihood estimation for state-space
   models, and test the model robustness to widely different forms of
   compensatory dynamics. The model can be used to estimate important
   quantities in the theory and practice of population recovery. (C) 2018

Title = {Occupancy time in sets of states for demographic models},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {120},
Pages = {62-77},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {As an individual moves through its life cycle, it passes through a
   series of states (age classes, size classes, reproductive states,
   spatial locations, health statuses, etc.) before its eventual death. The
   occupancy time in a state is the time spent in that state over the
   individual's life. Depending on the life cycle description, the
   occupancy times describe different demographic variables, for example,
   lifetime breeding success, lifetime habitat utilisation, or healthy
   longevity.
   Models based on absorbing Markov chains provide a powerful framework for
   the analysis of occupancy times. Current theory, however, can completely
   analyse only the occupancy of single states, although the occupancy time
   in a set of states is often desired. For example, a range of sizes in a
   size-classified model, an age class in an age x stage model, and a group
   of locations in a spatial stage model are all sets of states.
   We present a new mathematical approach to absorbing Markov chains that
   extends the analysis of life histories by providing a comprehensive
   theory for the occupancy of arbitrary sets of states, and for other
   demographic variables related to these sets (e.g., reaching time, return
   time). We apply this approach to a matrix population model of the
   Southern Fulmar (Fulmarus glacialoides). The analysis of this model
   provides interesting insight into the lifetime number of breeding
   attempts of this species.
   Our new approach to absorbing Markov chains, and its implementation in
   matrix oriented software, makes the analysis of occupancy times more
   accessible to population ecologists, and directly applicable to any
   matrix population models. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Title = {A coalescent dual process for a Wright-Fisher diffusion with
   recombination and its application to haplotype partitioning},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},

Abstract = {Duality plays an important role in population genetics. It can relate
   results from forwards-in-time models of allele frequency evolution with
   those of backwards-in-time genealogical models; a well known example is
   the duality between the Wright-Fisher diffusion for genetic drift and
   its genealogical counterpart, the coalescent. There have been a number
   of articles extending this relationship to include other evolutionary
   processes such as mutation and selection, but little has been explored
   for models also incorporating crossover recombination. Here, we derive
   from first principles a new genealogical process which is dual to a
   Wright-Fisher diffusion model of drift, mutation, and recombination. The
   process is reminiscent of the ancestral recombination graph, a
   widely-used multilocus genealogical model, but here ancestral lineages
   are typed and transition rates are regarded as being conditioned on an
   observed configuration at the leaves of the genealogy. Our approach is
   based on expressing a putative duality relationship between two models
   via their infinitesimal generators, and then seeking an appropriate test
   function to ensure the validity of the duality equation. This approach
   is quite general, and we use it to find dualities for several important
   variants, including both a discrete L-locus model of a gene and a
   continuous model in which mutation and recombination events are
   scattered along the gene according to continuous distributions. As an
   application of our results, we derive a series expansion for the
   transition function of the diffusion. Finally, we study in further
   detail the case in which mutation is absent. Then the dual process
   describes the dispersal of ancestral genetic material across the
   ancestors of a sample. The stationary distribution of this process is of
   particular interest; we show how duality relates this distribution to
   haplotype fixation probabilities. We develop an efficient method for
   computing such probabilities in multilocus models. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Title = {Bias in estimators of archaic admixture},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {100},
Pages = {63-78},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This article evaluates bias in one class of methods used to estimate
   archaic admixture in modern humans. These methods study the pattern of
   allele sharing among modern and archaic genomes. They are sensitive to
   ``ghost{''} admixture, which occurs when a population receives archaic
   DNA from sources not acknowledged by the statistical model. The effect
   of ghost admixture depends on two factors: branch-length bias and
   population-size bias. Branch-length bias occurs because a given amount
   of admixture has a larger effect if the two populations have been
   separated for a long time. Population-size bias occurs because
   differences in population size distort branch lengths in the gene
   genealogy. In the absence of ghost admixture, these effects are small.
   They become important, however, in the presence of ghost admixture.
   Estimators differ in the pattern of response. Increasing a given
   parameter may inflate one estimator but deflate another. For this
   reason, comparisons among estimators are informative. Using such
   comparisons, this article supports previous findings that the archaic
   population was small and that Europeans received little gene flow from
   archaic populations other than Neanderthals. It also identifies an
   inconsistency in estimates of archaic admixture into Melanesia. (C) 2014

Title = {A simple model and rules for the evolution of microbial mutualistic
   symbiosis with positive fitness feedbacks},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {160},
Pages = {14-24},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The evolution of microbe-microbe mutualistic symbiosis is considered to
   be promoted by repeated exchanges of fitness benefits, which can
   generate positive fitness feedbacks ('partner fidelity feedback')
   between species. However, previous evolutionary models for mutualism
   have not captured feedback dynamics or coupling of fitness between
   species. Here, a simple population model is developed to understand the
   evolution of mutualistic symbiosis in which two microbial species (host
   and symbiont) continuously grow and exchange fitness benefits to
   generate feedback dynamics but do not strictly control each other. The
   assumption that individual microbes provide constant amounts of
   resources, which are equally divided among interacting partner
   individual, enables us to reveal a simple rule for the evolution of
   costly mutualism with positive fitness feedbacks: the product of the
   benefit-to-cost ratios for each species exceeds one. When this condition
   holds, high cooperative investment levels are favored in both species
   regardless of the amount invested by each partner. The model is then
   extended to examine how symbiont mutation, immigration, or switching
   affects the spread of selfish or cooperative symbionts, which decrease
   and increase their investment levels, respectively. In particular, when
   a host associates with numerous symbionts without enforcement, neither
   mutation nor immigration but rather random switching would allow the
   spread of cooperative symbionts. Examples using symbiont switching for
   evolution would include large ciliates hosting numerous intracellular
   endosymbionts. The simple model and rules would provide a basis for
   understanding the evolution of microbe-microbe mutualistic symbiosis
   with positive fitness feedbacks and without enforcement mechanisms.},

Title = {Limits to selection on standing variation in an asexual population},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {157},
Pages = {129-137},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {We consider how a population of.. haploid individuals responds to
   directional selection on standing variation, with no new variation from
   recombination or mutation. Individuals have trait values..1,.,....,
   which are drawn from a distribution..; the fitness of individual.. is
   proportional to....... For illustration, we consider the Laplace and
   Gaussian distributions, which are parametrised only by the variance..0,

   v.. 0 << 1), the variance decreases exponentially at rate 1/.., and the
   expected ultimate gain in log fitness (scaled by v..0), is just.. v..0,
   which is the same as Robertson's (1960) prediction for a sexual
   population. In contrast, when selection is strong relative to drift
   (..v.. 0 >> 1), the ultimate gain can be found by approximating the
   establishment of alleles by a branching process in which each allele
   competes independently with the population mean and the fittest allele
   to establish is certain to fix. Then, if the probability of survival to

   also predicts the variability of the process, and its dynamics; we show
   that in the strong selection regime, the expected genetic variance

   related to selection on standing variation that is spread along a linear

Title = {Pneumococcus and the stress-gradient hypothesis: A trade-off links
   R<sub>0</sub> and susceptibility to co-colonization across countries},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {156},
Pages = {77-92},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Modern molecular technologies have revolutionized our understanding of
   bacterial epidemiology, but reported data across studies and different
   geographic endemic settings remain under-integrated in common
   theoretical frameworks. Pneumococcus serotype co-colonization, caused by
   the polymorphic bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae, has been increasingly
   investigated and reported in recent years. While the global genomic
   diversity and serotype distribution of S. pneumoniae have been
   well-characterized, there is limited information on how co-colonization
   patterns vary globally, critical for understanding the evolution and
   transmission dynamics of the bacteria. Gathering a rich dataset of
   cross-sectional pneumococcal colonization studies in the literature, we
   quantified patterns of transmission intensity and co-colonization
   prevalence variation in children populations across 17 geographic
   locations. Linking these data to an SIS model with cocolonization under
   the assumption of quasi-neutrality among multiple interacting strains,
   our analysis reveals strong patterns of negative covariation between
   transmission intensity (R-0) and susceptibility to co-colonization (k).
   In line with expectations from the stress-gradient-hypothesis in ecology
   (SGH), pneumococcus serotypes appear to compete more in co-colonization
   in high-transmission settings and compete less in low-transmission
   settings, a trade-off which ultimately leads to a conserved ratio of
   single to co-colonization mu = 1/(R-0-1). From the mathematical model's
   behavior, such conservation suggests preservation of
   `stability-diversity-complexity' regimes in coexistence of similar
   co-colonizing strains. We find no major differences in serotype
   compositions across studies, pointing to adaptation of the same set of
   serotypes across variable environments as an explanation for their
   differential interaction in different transmission settings. Our work
   highlights that the understanding of transmission patterns of
   Streptococcus pneumoniae from global scale epidemiological data can
   benefit from simple analytical approaches that account for
   quasi-neutrality among strains, co-colonization, as well as variable
   environmental adaptation.},

Title = {Dynamics of SIR model with heterogeneous response to intervention policy},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {146},
Pages = {71-85},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {In classical epidemic theory, behavior is assumed to be stationary. In
   recent years, epidemic models have been extended to include behaviors
   that transition in response to the current state of the epidemic.
   However, it is widely known that human behavior can exhibit strong
   history-dependence as a consequence of learned experiences. This
   history-dependence is similar to hysteresis phenomena that have been
   well-studied in control theory. To illustrate the importance of
   history-dependence for epidemic theory, we study dynamics of a variant
   of the SIRS model where individuals exhibit lazy-switch responses to
   prevalence dynamics, based on the Preisach hysteresis operator. The
   resulting model can possess a continuum of endemic equilibrium states
   characterized by different proportions of susceptible, infected and
   recovered populations. We consider how the limit point of the epidemic
   trajectory and the infection peak along this trajectory depend on the
   degree of heterogeneity of the response. Our approach supports the
   argument that public health responses during the emergence of a new
   disease can have fundamental long-term consequences for subsequent
   management efforts. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

   space are given: one concerning when dispersal causes smaller or larger
   total biomass than no dispersal, and the other addressing how the total
   biomass changes with dispersal intensity and dispersal asymmetry. The
   dependencies of the population abundance of each individual patch on
   dispersal intensity and dispersal asymmetry are also fully
   characterized. In addition, the maximal and minimal total population
   sizes induced by dispersal are determined for the logistic model with an
   arbitrary number of patches, and a weak order-preserving result
   correlated the local population abundances with and without dispersal is
   established. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Loss of genetic variation in the two-locus multiallelic haploid model},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {136},
Pages = {12-21},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In the evolutionary biology literature, it is generally assumed that for
   deterministic frequency-independent haploid selection models, no
   polymorphic equilibrium can be stable in the absence of
   variation-generating mechanisms such as mutation. However, mathematical
   analyses that corroborate this claim are scarce and almost always depend
   upon additional assumptions. Using ideas from game theory, we show that
   a monomorphism is a global attractor if one of its alleles dominates all
   other alleles at its locus. Further, we show that no isolated
   equilibrium exists, at which an unequal number of alleles from two loci
   is present. Under the assumption of convergence of trajectories to
   equilibrium points, we resolve the two-locus three-allele case for a
   fitness scheme formally equivalent to the classical symmetric viability
   model. We also provide an alternative proof for the two-locus two-allele
   case. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.},

Abstract = {Biological control, the use of predators and pathogens to control target
   pests, is a promising alternative to chemical control. It is
   hypothesized that the introduced predators efficacy can be boosted by
   providing them with an additional food source. The current literature
   (Srinivasu, 2007; 2010; 2011) claims that if the additional food is of
   sufficiently large quantity and quality then pest eradication is
   possible in finite time. The purpose of the current manuscript is to
   show that to the contrary, pest eradication is not possible in finite
   time, for any quantity and quality of additional food. We show that pest
   eradication will occur only in infinite time, and derive decay rates to
   the extinction state. We posit a new modeling framework to yield finite
   time pest extinction. Our results have large scale implications for the
   effective design of biological control methods involving additional
   food. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Domesticated individuals are likely to be maladaptive in the wild due to
   adaptation to captivity. Escaped aquaculture fish can cause unintended
   fitness and demographic consequences for their wild conspecifics through
   interbreeding and competition. Escape events from different sources
   exhibit great heterogeneity in their frequencies and magnitudes, ranging
   from rare but large spillover during a storm, to continuous low-level
   leakage caused by operational errors. The timescale of escape events
   determines the distribution of gene flow from aquaculture to the wild.
   The evolutionary consequences of this variation in timescale will depend
   on the degree of generation overlap and the focal species' life history
   attributes, especially those under selection in aquaculture (e.g.,
   growth rate, which can influence additional demographically important
   traits such as age at maturity). To evaluate the effects of variable
   escape both within and across generations, we construct an
   age-structured model of coupled genetic and demographic dynamics and
   parameterize it for species with contrasting life history
   characteristics (Salmo solar and Gadus morhua). Our results are
   consistent with earlier discrete-generation models that constant,
   low-level spillover can have a greater impact than rare, large pulses of
   leakage, even after accounting for the averaging effects of overlapping
   generations. The age-structured model also allows detailed evaluation of
   the role of different life history traits, which reveals that species
   with longer generation times might experience greater fitness
   consequences of aquaculture spillover but are less sensitive to
   variability in spillover. Additionally, environment-induced earlier
   maturity of escapees can increase the fitness effects on wild fish,
   especially those with shorter generation times. Our results suggest that
   effective management to minimize the unintended fitness consequences of
   aquaculture releases might require extensive monitoring efforts on
   constant, low-level spillover and assessment of the focal species' life
   history characteristics. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Using a nonparametric Bayesian approach Palacios and Minin (2013)
   dramatically improved the accuracy, precision of Bayesian inference of
   population size trajectories from gene genealogies. These authors
   proposed an extension of a Gaussian Process (GP) nonparametric
   inferential method for the intensity function of non-homogeneous Poisson
   processes. They found that not only the statistical properties of the
   estimators were improved with their method, but also, that key aspects
   of the demographic histories were recovered. The authors' work
   represents the first Bayesian nonparametric solution to this inferential
   problem because they specify a convenient prior belief without a
   particular functional form on the population trajectory. Their approach
   works so well and provides such a profound understanding of the
   biological process, that the question arises as to how truly
   ``biology-free{''} their approach really is. Using well-known concepts
   of stochastic population dynamics, here I demonstrate that in fact,
   Palacios and Minin's GP model can be cast as a parametric population
   growth model with density dependence and environmental stochasticity.
   Making this link between population genetics and stochastic population
   dynamics modeling provides novel insights into eliciting biologically
   meaningful priors for the trajectory of the effective population size.
   The results presented here also bring novel understanding of GP as
   models for the evolution of a trait. Thus, the ecological principles
   foundation of Palacios and Minin (2013)'s prior adds to the conceptual
   and scientific value of these authors' inferential approach. I conclude
   this note by listing a series of insights brought about by this
   connection with Ecology. (C) 2017 The Author. Published by Elsevier Inc.},

Title = {Theory of partitioning of disease prevalence and mortality in
   observational data},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {114},
Pages = {117-127},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {In this study, we present a new theory of partitioning of disease
   prevalence and incidence-based mortality and demonstrate how this theory
   practically works for analyses of Medicare data. In the theory, the
   prevalence of a disease and incidence-based mortality are modeled in
   terms of disease incidence and survival after diagnosis supplemented by
   information on disease prevalence at the initial age and year available
   in a dataset. Partitioning of the trends of prevalence and mortality is
   calculated with minimal assumptions. The resulting expressions for the
   components of the trends are given by continuous functions of data. The
   estimator is consistent and stable. The developed methodology is applied
   for data on type 2 diabetes using individual records from a nationally
   representative 5\% sample of Medicare beneficiaries age 65+. Numerical
   estimates show excellent concordance between empirical estimates and
   theoretical predictions. Evaluated partitioning model showed that both
   prevalence and mortality increase with time. The primary driving factors
   of the observed prevalence increase are improved survival and increased
   prevalence at age 65. The increase in diabetes-related mortality is
   driven by increased prevalence and unobserved trends in time-periods and
   age-groups outside of the range of the data used in the study. Finally,
   the properties of the new estimator, possible statistical and
   systematical uncertainties, and future practical applications of this
   methodology in epidemiology, demography, public health and health
   forecasting are discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Differences in the effective population sizes of males and females do
   not require differences in their distribution of offspring number},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {114},
Pages = {19-28},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Difference in male and female effective population sizes has, at times,
   been attributed to both sexes having unequal variance in their number of
   offspring. Such difference is paralleled by the relative effective sizes
   of autosomes, sex chromosomes, and mitochondrial DNA. I develop a simple
   framework to calculate the inbreeding effective population sizes for
   loci with different modes of inheritance. In this framework, I separate
   the effects due to mating strategy and those due to genetic
   transmission. I then show that, in addition to differences in the
   variance in offspring number, skew in the male/female effective sizes
   can also be caused by family composition. This approach can be used to
   illustrate the effect of induced behaviors on the relative male and
   female effective population sizes. In particular, I show the impact of
   the one-child policy formerly implemented in the People's Republic of
   China on the relative male and female effective population sizes.
   Furthermore, I argue that, under some strong constraints on family
   structure, the concepts of male and female effective population sizes
   are invalid. (C) 2016 The Author. Published by Elsevier Inc.},

Title = {Rate matrix estimation from site frequency data},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {113},
Pages = {23-33},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {A procedure is described for estimating evolutionary rate matrices from
   observed site frequency data. The procedure assumes (1) that the data
   are obtained from a constant size population evolving according to a
   stationary Wright-Fisher or decoupled Moran model; (2) that the data
   consist of a multiple alignment of a moderate number of sequenced
   genomes drawn randomly from the population; and (3) that within the
   genome a large number of independent, neutral sites evolving with a
   common mutation rate matrix can be identified. No restrictions are
   imposed on the scaled rate matrix other than that the off-diagonal
   elements are positive, their sum is << 1, and that the rows of the
   matrix sum to zero. In particular the rate matrix is not assumed to be
   reversible. The key to the method is an approximate stationary solution
   to the diffusion limit, forward Kolmogorov equation for neutral
   evolution in the limit of low mutation rates. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All

Title = {Population size vs. social connectedness - A gene-culture coevolutionary
   approach to cumulative cultural evolution},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {111},
Pages = {87-95},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {It has long been debated if population size is a crucial determinant of
   the level of culture. While empirical results are mixed, recent
   theoretical studies suggest that social connectedness between people may
   be a more important factor than the size of the entire population. These
   models, however, do not take into account evolutionary responses of
   learning strategies determining the mode of transmission and innovation
   and are hence not suitable for predicting the long-term implications of
   parameters of interest. In the present paper, to address this issue, we
   provide a gene-culture coevolution model, in which the microscopic
   learning process of each individual is explicitly described as a
   continuous-time stochastic process and time allocation to social and
   individual learning is allowed to evolve. We have found that social
   connectedness has a larger impact on the equilibrium level of culture
   than population size especially when connectedness is weak and
   population size is large. This result, combined with those of previous
   culture-only models, points to the importance of studying separate
   effects of population size and internal social structure to better
   understand spatiotemporal variation in the level of culture. (C) 2016

Title = {On joint subtree distributions under two evolutionary models},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {108},
Pages = {13-23},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {In population and evolutionary biology, hypotheses about
   micro-evolutionary and macro-evolutionary processes are commonly tested
   by comparing the shape indices of empirical evolutionary trees with
   those predicted by neutral models. A key ingredient in this approach is
   the ability to compute and quantify distributions of various tree shape
   indices under random models of interest. As a step to meet this
   challenge, in this paper we investigate the joint distribution of
   cherries and pitchforks (that is, subtrees with two and three leaves)
   under two widely used null models: the Yule-Harding-Kingman (YHK) model
   and the proportional to distinguishable arrangements (PDA) model. Based
   on two novel recursive formulae, we propose a dynamic approach to
   numerically compute the exact joint distribution (and hence the marginal
   distributions) for trees of any size. We also obtained insights into the
   statistical properties of trees generated under these two models,
   including a constant correlation between the cherry and the pitchfork
   distributions under the YHK model, and the log-concavity and unimodality
   of the cherry distributions under both models. In addition, we show that
   there exists a unique change point for the cherry distributions between
   these two models. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {On the interpretation and relevance of the Fundamental Theorem of
   Natural Selection},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {104},
Pages = {59-67},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The attempt to understand the statement, and then to find the
   interpretation, of Fisher's ``Fundamental Theorem of Natural
   Selection{''} caused problems for generations of population geneticists.
   Price's (1972) paper was the first to lead to an understanding of the
   statement of the theorem. The theorem shows (in the discrete-time case)
   that the so-called ``partial change{''} in mean fitness of a population
   between a parental generation and an offspring generation is the
   parental generation additive genetic variance in fitness divided by the
   parental generation mean fitness. In the continuous-time case the
   partial rate of change in mean fitness is equal to the parental
   generation additive genetic variance in fitness with no division by the
   mean fitness. This ``partial change{''} has been interpreted by some as
   the change in mean fitness due to changes in gene frequency, and by
   others as the change in mean fitness due to natural selection. (Fisher
   variously used both interpretations.) In this paper we discuss these
   interpretations of the theorem. We indicate why we are unhappy with
   both. We also discuss the long-term relevance of the Fundamental Theorem
   of Natural Selection, again reaching a negative assessment. We introduce
   and discuss the concept of genic evolutionary potential. We finally
   review an optimizing theorem that involves changes in gene frequency,
   the additive genetic variance in fitness and the mean fitness itself,
   all of which are involved in the Fundamental Theorem of Natural
   Selection, and which is free of the difficulties in interpretation of
   the Fundamental Theorem of Natural Selection. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All

Title = {Alternative stable states in a stage-structured consumer-resource
   biomass model with niche shift and seasonal reproduction},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {103},
Pages = {60-70},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {We formulate and analyze a stage-structured consumer-resource biomass
   model, in which consumers reproduce in a pulsed event at the beginning
   of a growing season and furthermore go through a niche shift during
   their life history. We show that the resulting semi-discrete model can
   exhibit two stable states that can be characterized as a
   development-controlled state and a reproduction-controlled state.
   Varying resource availabilities and varying the extent of the niche
   shift determines whether juveniles or adults are more limited by their
   resource(s) and can lead to switches between the alternative stable
   states. Furthermore, we quantify the persistence of the consumer
   population and the occurrence of the two alternative stable states as a
   function of resource availabilities and extent of the niche shift. All
   the results show that irrespective of the type of reproduction of the
   consumers (continuous or seasonal), the stage-structured model will
   exhibit alternative stable states as long as development of the juvenile
   stage and reproduction of the adult stage are both resource-dependent.

Title = {Evolution of cooperation in a multidimensional phenotype space},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {102},
Pages = {60-75},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The emergence of cooperation in populations of selfish individuals is a
   fascinating topic that has inspired much theoretical work. An important
   model to study cooperation is the phenotypic model, where individuals
   are characterized by phenotypic properties that are visible to others.
   The phenotype of an individual can be represented for instance by a
   vector x = (x(1), ... ,x(n)), where x(1), ... ,x(n) are integers. The
   population can be well mixed in the sense that everyone is equally
   likely to interact with everyone else, but the behavioral strategies of
   the individuals can depend on their distance in the phenotype space. A
   cooperator can choose to help other individuals exhibiting the same
   phenotype and defects otherwise. Cooperation is said to be favored by
   selection if it is more abundant than defection in the stationary state.
   This means that the average frequency of cooperators in the stationary
   state strictly exceeds 1/2. Antal et al. (2009c) found conditions that
   ensure that cooperation is more abundant than defection in a
   one-dimensional (i.e. n = 1) and an infinite-dimensional (i.e. n =
   infinity) phenotype space in the case of the Prisoner's Dilemma under
   weak selection. However, reality lies between these two limit cases. In
   this paper, we derive the corresponding condition in the case of a
   phenotype space of any finite dimension. This is done by applying a
   perturbation method to study a mutation-selection equilibrium under weak
   selection. This condition is obtained in the limit of a large population
   size by using the ancestral process. The best scenario for cooperation
   to be more likely to evolve is found to be a high population-scaled
   phenotype mutation rate, a low population-scaled strategy mutation rate
   and a high phenotype space dimension. The biological intuition is that a
   high population-scaled phenotype mutation rate reduces the quantity of
   interactions between cooperators and defectors, while a high
   population-scaled strategy mutation rate introduces newly mutated
   defectors that invade groups of cooperators. Finally it is easier for
   cooperation to evolve in a phenotype space of higher dimension because

Title = {The demography of a metapopulation in an environment changing in time

Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {94},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The persistence of populations living in heterogeneous environments
   crucially depends on the interaction between changes of the environment
   in space and time, and the way individuals move between locations. Here
   an approximation for the multiplicative growth rate of a metapopulation
   is derived, as a function of the properties of the spatial heterogeneity
   and temporal change in local habitat quality, and the dispersal pattern.
   This analysis reveals that the growth rate depends on (i) the geometric
   mean of the average growth rate in the metapopulation, (ii) whether
   individuals tend to be more numerous in high quality demes and (iii)
   temporal fluctuations in the spatial distribution of individuals. The
   two latter effects had been previously identified but mostly in
   simulation studies. Here I identify them in a unified analytical
   framework which helps clarifying previous studies. This analysis reveals
   that the shape of temporal variability interacts with the dispersal rate
   to determine the growth of the metapopulation, and in particular that
   the effects of dispersal depend on the level of temporal correlation of
   the environment. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {The adaptive invasion of epialleles in a heterogeneous environment},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {88},
Pages = {1-8},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The evolution of transgenerational epigenetic adaptation is driven by
   the invasion and stable inheritance of epialleles. Here, we describe a
   population-genetic model subject to environmentally-induced epigenetic
   effects in order to investigate the conditions under which an
   epigenetically modifiable allele (epiallele) can invade a population
   insensitive to such cues. Here, epigenetically modifiable individuals
   have the potential to develop a phenotype that is suitable for their
   predicted future environment and, provided this prediction is correct,
   possess a biological advantage compared to their non-modifiable
   counterpart. However, when individuals experience an environment that
   `mismatches' their phenotype, an advantage over unmodifiable individuals
   may be precluded and instead they experience a decrease in fitness.
   These epigenetic modifications are then inherited by the next generation
   which are either epigenetically reset to match their environment or, by
   resisting environmental cues, maintain their epigenetic status. We found
   that when environmental cues were common, a severe fitness cost of
   mismatch between environment and phenotype meant that the disadvantage
   was too costly and epialleles were less likely to invade. Moreover, for
   a wide range of parameters, a higher rate of germline epigenetic
   resetting decreased the likelihood of epiallele invasion. Accordingly,
   we found that both the frequency of environmental influences and the
   rate of resetting were central parameters in this system. (C) 2013

Title = {The evolutionary potential of paramutation: A population-epigenetic
   model},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {88},
Pages = {9-19},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Paramutation involves an interaction between homologous alleles
   resulting in a heritable change in gene expression without altering the
   DNA sequence. Initially believed to be restricted to plants,
   paramutation has recently been observed in animal models, and a
   paramutation-like event has been noted in humans. Despite the
   accumulating evidence suggesting that trans-acting epigenetic effects
   can be inherited transgenerationally and therefore generate non-genomic
   phenotypic variation, these effects have been largely ignored in the
   context of evolutionary theory. The model presented here incorporates
   paramutation into the standard model of viability selection at one locus
   and demonstrates that paramutation can create long-term biological
   diversity in the absence of genetic change, and even in the absence of
   the original paramutagenic allele. Therefore, if paramutation is
   present, attributing evolution to only a traditional genetic model may
   fail to encompass the broad scope of phenotypic differences observed in
   nature. Moreover, we show also that an unusual mathematical behaviour,
   analogous to ``Ewens' gap{''} of the two-locus two-allele
   symmetric-selection model, occurs: when the rate of one parameter - for
   example, the rate of paramutation - is increased, a pair of equilibria
   may disappear only to reappear as this parameter increases further. In
   summary, by incorporating even the simplest epigenetic parameters into
   the standard population-genetic model of selection, we show how this
   type of inheritance system can profoundly alter the course of evolution.

Title = {Ecological and genetic effects of introduced species on their native
   competitors},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {84},
Pages = {25-35},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Species introductions to new habitats can cause a decline in the
   population size of competing native species and consequently also in
   their genetic diversity. We are interested in why these adverse effects
   are weak in some cases whereas in others the native species declines to
   the point of extinction. While the introduction rate and the growth rate
   of the introduced species in the new environment clearly have a positive
   relationship with invasion success and impact, the influence of
   competition is poorly understood. Here, we investigate how the intensity
   of interspecific competition influences the persistence time of a native
   species in the face of repeated and ongoing introductions of the
   nonnative species. We analyze two stochastic models: a model for the
   population dynamics of both species and a model that additionally
   includes the population genetics of the native species at a locus
   involved in its adaptation to a changing environment.
   Counterintuitively, both models predict that the persistence time of the
   native species is lowest for an intermediate intensity of competition.
   This phenomenon results from the opposing effects of competition at
   different stages of the invasion process: With increasing competition
   intensity more introduction events are needed until a new species can
   establish, but increasing competition also speeds up the exclusion of
   the native species by an established nonnative competitor. By comparing
   the ecological and the eco-genetic model, we detect and quantify a
   synergistic feedback between ecological and genetic effects. (C) 2012

Title = {Beyond fitness: The information imparted in population states by
   selection throughout lifecycles},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {157},
Pages = {86-117},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {We approach the questions, what part of evolutionary change results from
   selection, and what is the adaptive information flow into a population
   undergoing selection, as a problem of quantifying the divergence of
   typical trajectories realized under selection from the expected dynamics
   of their counterparts under a null stochastic -process model
   representing the absence of selection. This approach starts with a
   formulation of adaptation in terms of information and from that
   identifies selection from the genetic parameters that generate
   information flow; it is the reverse of a historical approach that
   defines selection in terms of fitness, and then identifies adaptive
   characters as those amplified in relative frequency by fitness. Adaptive
   information is a relative entropy on distributions of histories computed
   directly from the generators of stochastic evolutionary population
   processes, which in large population limits can be approximated by its
   leading exponential dependence as a large -deviation function. We study
   a particular class of generators that represent the genetic dependence
   of explicit transitions around reproductive cycles in terms of
   stoichiometry, familiar from chemical reaction networks. Following Smith
   (2023), which showed that partitioning evolutionary events among
   genetically distinct realizations of lifecycles yields a more consistent
   causal analysis through the Price equation than the construction from
   units of selection and fitness, here we show that it likewise yields
   more complete evolutionary information measures.},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {A multi -type neutral Cannings population model with migration and fixed
   subpopulation sizes is analyzed. Under appropriate conditions, as all
   subpopulation sizes tend to infinity, the ancestral process, properly
   time -scaled, converges to a multi -type coalescent sharing the
   exchangeability and consistency property. The proof gains from
   coalescent theory for single -type Cannings models and from
   decompositions of transition probabilities into parts concerning
   reproduction and migration respectively. The following section deals
   with a different but closely related multi -type Cannings model with
   mutation and fixed total population size but stochastically varying
   subpopulation sizes. The latter model is analyzed forward and backward
   in time with an emphasis on its behavior as the total population size
   tends to infinity. Forward in time, multi -type limiting branching
   processes arise for large population size. Its backward structure and
   related open problems are briefly discussed.},

Title = {Untangling the role of temporal and spatial variations in persistence of
   populations},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {154},
Pages = {1-26},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {We consider a population distributed between two habitats, in each of
   which it experiences a growth rate that switches periodically between
   two values, 1 - epsilon > 0 or -(1 +epsilon) < 0. We study the specific
   case where the growth rate is positive in one habitat and negative in
   the other one for the first half of the period, and conversely for the
   second half of the period, that we refer as the (+/- 1) model. In the
   absence of migration, the population goes to 0 exponentially fast in
   each environment. In this paper, we show that, when the period is
   sufficiently large, a small dispersal between the two patches is able to
   produce a very high positive exponential growth rate for the whole
   population, a phenomena called inflation. We prove in particular that
   the threshold of the dispersal rate at which the inflation appears is
   exponentially small with the period. We show that inflation is robust to
   random perturbation, by considering a model where the values of the
   growth rate in each patch are switched at random times: we prove that
   inflation occurs for low switching rate and small dispersal. We also
   consider another stochastic model, where after each period of time T,
   the values of the growth rates in each patch is chosen randomly,
   independently from the other patch and from the past. Finally, we
   provide some extensions to more complicated models, especially
   epidemiological and density dependent models. (c) 2023 Elsevier Inc. All

Title = {Gene drives and population persistence vs elimination: The impact of
   spatial structure and inbreeding at low density},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {145},
Pages = {109-125},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Synthetic gene drive constructs are being developed to control disease
   vectors, invasive species, and other pest species. In a well-mixed
   random mating population a sufficiently strong gene drive is expected to
   eliminate a target population, but it is not clear whether the same is
   true when spatial processes play a role. In species with an appropriate
   biology it is possible that drive-induced reductions in density might
   lead to increased inbreeding, reducing the efficacy of drive, eventually
   leading to suppression rather than elimination, regardless of how strong
   the drive is. To investigate this question we analyse a series of
   explicitly solvable stochastic models considering a range of scenarios
   for the relative timing of mating, reproduction, and dispersal and
   analyse the impact of two different types of gene drive, a Driving Y
   chromosome and a homing construct targeting an essential gene. We find
   in all cases a sufficiently strong Driving Y will go to fixation and the
   population will be eliminated, except in the one life history scenario
   (reproduction and mating in patches followed by dispersal) where low
   density leads to increased inbreeding, in which case the population
   persists indefinitely, tending to either a stable equilibrium or a limit
   cycle. These dynamics arise because Driving Y males have reduced mating
   success, particularly at low densities, due to having fewer sisters to
   mate with. Increased inbreeding at low densities can also prevent a
   homing construct from eliminating a population. For both types of drive,
   if there is strong inbreeding depression, then the population cannot be
   rescued by inbreeding and it is eliminated. These results highlight the
   potentially critical role that low-density-induced inbreeding and
   inbreeding depression (and, by extension, other sources of Allee
   effects) can have on the eventual impact of a gene drive on a target
   population. (c) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.},

Title = {Fitting stochastic predator-prey models using both population density
   and kill rate data},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {138},
Pages = {1-27},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Most mechanistic predator-prey modelling has involved either
   parameterization from process rate data or inverse modelling. Here, we
   take a median road: we aim at identifying the potential benefits of
   combining datasets, when both population growth and predation processes
   are viewed as stochastic. We fit a discrete-time, stochastic
   predator-prey model of the Leslie type to simulated time series of
   densities and kill rate data. Our model has both environmental
   stochasticity in the growth rates and interaction stochasticity, i.e., a
   stochastic functional response. We examine what the kill rate data
   brings to the quality of the estimates, and whether estimation is
   possible (for various time series lengths) solely with time series of
   population counts or biomass data. Both Bayesian and frequentist
   estimation are performed, providing multiple ways to check model
   identifiability. The Fisher Information Matrix suggests that models with
   and without kill rate data are all identifiable, although correlations
   remain between parameters that belong to the same functional form.
   However, our results show that if the attractor is a fixed point in the
   absence of stochasticity, identifying parameters in practice requires
   kill rate data as a complement to the time series of population
   densities, due to the relatively flat likelihood. Only noisy limit cycle
   attractors can be identified directly from population count data (as in
   inverse modelling), although even in this case, adding kill rate data
   including in small amounts - can make the estimates much more precise.
   Overall, we show that under process stochasticity in interaction rates,
   interaction data might be essential to obtain identifiable dynamical
   models for multiple species. These results may extend to other biotic
   interactions than predation, for which similar models combining
   interaction rates and population counts could be developed. (C) 2021

Title = {The effect of temporal fluctuations on the evolution of host tolerance
   to parasitism},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {130},
Pages = {182-190},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {There are many mechanisms that hosts can evolve to defend against
   parasites, two of which are resistance and tolerance. These defences
   often have different evolutionary behaviours, and it is important to
   consider how each individual mechanism may respond to changes in
   environment. In particular, host defence through tolerance is predicted
   to be unlikely to lead to variation, despite many observations of
   diversity in both animal and plant systems. Hence understanding the
   drivers of diversity in host defence and parasite virulence is vital for
   predicting future evolutionary changes in infectious disease dynamics.
   It has been suggested that heterogeneous environments might generally
   promote diversity, but the effect of temporal fluctuations has received
   little attention theoretically or empirically, and there has been no
   examination of how temporal fluctuations affects the evolution of host
   tolerance. In this study, we use a mathematical model to investigate the
   evolution of host tolerance in a temporally fluctuating environment. We
   show that investment in tolerance increases in more variable
   environments, giving qualitatively different evolutionary behaviours
   when compared to resistance. Once seasonality is introduced evolutionary
   branching though tolerance can occur and create diversity within the
   population, although potentially only temporarily. This branching
   behaviour arises due to the emergence of a negative feedback with the
   maximum infected density on a cycle, which is strongest when the
   infected population is large. This work reinforces the qualitative
   differences between tolerance and resistance evolution, but also
   provides theoretical evidence for the theory that heterogeneous
   environments promote host-parasite diversity, hence constant environment
   assumptions may omit important evolutionary outcomes. (C) 2019 Elsevier

Abstract = {Mate choice through direct assortment on heritable traits, assortative
   mating (AM), is predicted in theory to inflate the genetic variance in a
   population and the correlation between relatives. Here, we revisit the
   theory of AM, first established in the landmark 1918 paper from RA
   Fisher, and provide new theory and analytical results. In particular, we
   shed light on inconsistencies in the literature regarding the
   correlation between double first cousins under AM and provide a
   solution. We derive new theory for AM due to X-chromosome loci. We show
   in the latter case that the inflation of genetic variance induced under
   AM is twice as large in females compared to males. These two theoretical
   contributions are verified and illustrated through simulations. We also
   provide a more general unified framework for the correlation between
   relatives in a non-inbred population. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {The parent-offspring probability when sampling age-structured
   populations},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {118},
Pages = {20-26},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {We consider two individuals sampled from an age-structured population,
   and derive the probability that these have a parent-offspring
   relationship. Such probabilities play an important role in the recently
   proposed close-kin mark-recapture methods. The probability is decomposed
   into three terms. The first is the probability of the parent being
   alive, the second term involves the mechanism by which individuals are
   sampled, and the third term is a contribution from the observed age of
   the parent. A stable age distribution in the population is assumed, and
   we provide an expression for how this distribution is perturbed by the
   information that an individual has given birth at a particular time
   point in the past or in the future. Calculations are performed from the
   perspective of the offspring, but we also make comparison to the
   situation where the perspective is put on the parent. Although the
   resulting probabilities are the same, the actual calculations differ,
   due to the asymmetry of a parent-offspring relationship. (C) 2017

Title = {How environmental noise can contract and destroy a persistence zone in
   population models with Allee effect},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {115},
Pages = {61-68},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {A problem of the analysis of the noise-induced extinction in population
   models with Allee effect is considered. To clarify mechanisms of the
   extinction, we suggest a new technique combining an analysis of the
   geometry of attractors and their stochastic sensitivity. For the
   conceptual one-dimensional discrete Ricker-type model, on the base of
   the bifurcation analysis, deterministic persistence zones are
   constructed in the space of initial states and biological parameters. It
   is shown that the random environmental noise can contract, and even
   destroy these persistence zones. A parametric analysis of the
   probabilistic mechanism of the noise-induced extinction in regular and
   chaotic zones is carried out with the help of the unified approach based
   on the sensitivity functions technique and confidence domains method.

Title = {Inclusive fitness analysis of cumulative cultural evolution in an
   island-structured population},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {115},
Pages = {13-23},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The success of humans on the globe is largely supported by our cultural
   excellence. Our culture is cumulative, meaning that it is improved from
   generation to generation. Previous works have revealed that two modes of
   learning, individual learning and social learning, play pivotal roles in
   the accumulation of culture. However, under the trade-off between
   learning and reproduction, one's investment into learning is easily
   exploited by those who copy the knowledge of skillful individuals and
   selfishly invest more efforts in reproduction. It has been shown that in
   order to prevent such a breakdown, the rate of vertical transmission
   (i.e. transmission from parents to their offspring) of culture must be
   unrealistically close to one. Here we investigate what if the population
   is spatially structured. In particular, we hypothesize that spatial
   structure should favor highly cumulative culture through endogenously
   arising high kinship. We employ Wright's island model and assume that
   cultural transmission occurs within a local island. Our inclusive
   fitness analysis reveals combined effects of direct fitness of the
   actor, indirect fitness through relatives in the current generation, and
   indirect fitness through relatives in future generations. The magnitude
   of those indirect benefits is measured by intergenerational coefficients
   of genetic relatedness. Our result suggests that the introduction of
   spatial structure raises the stationary level of culture in the
   population, but that the extent of its improvement compared with a
   well-mixed population is marginal unless spatial localization is
   extreme. Overall, our model implies that we need an alternative
   mechanism to explain highly cumulative culture of modern humans. (C)

Title = {How optimally foraging predators promote prey coexistence in a variable
   environment},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {114},
Pages = {40-58},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Optimal foraging is one of the major predictive theories of predator
   foraging behavior. However, how an optimally foraging predator affects
   the coexistence of competing prey is not well understood either in a
   constant or variable environment, especially for multiple prey species.
   We study the impact of optimal foraging on prey coexistence using an
   annual plant model, with and without annual variation in seed
   germination. Seed predators are modeled using Charnov's model of
   adaptive diet choice. Our results reveal that multiple prey species can
   coexist because of this type of predator, and that their effect is not
   greatly modified by environmental variation. However, in diverse
   communities, the requirements for coexistence by optimal foraging alone
   are very restrictive. Optimally foraging predators can have a strong
   equalizing effect on their prey by creating a competition-predation
   trade-off. Thus, their main role in promoting diversity may be to reduce
   species-average fitness differences, making it easier for other
   mechanisms, such as the storage effect, to allow multiple species to
   coexist. Like previous models, our model showed that when germination
   rates vary, the storage effect from competition promotes coexistence.
   Our results also show that optimally foraging predators can generate a
   negative storage effect from predation, undermining coexistence, but
   that this effect will be minor whenever predators commonly differentiate
   their prey. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {The importance of being atomic: Ecological invasions as random walks
   instead of waves},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {112},
Pages = {157-169},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Invasions are one of the most easily identified spatial phenomena in
   ecology, and have inspired a rich variety of theories for ecologists'
   and naturalists' consideration. However, a number of arguments over the
   sensitivities of invasion rates to stochasticity, density-dependence,
   dimension, and discreteness persist in the literature.
   The standard mathematical approach to invasions is based on Fisher's
   analysis of traveling waves solutions for the spread of an advantageous
   allele. In this paper, we exploit an alternative theory based on
   Ellner's premise that species invasions are best interpreted not as
   waves, but as random walks, and that the discreteness of living
   organisms is fundamentally important. Using a density-dependent invasion
   model in a stationary environment with indivisible (atomic) individuals
   where reproduction and dispersal are stochastic and independent, we show
   4 key properties of Ellner's invasions previously suggested by
   simulation analysis: (1) greater spatial dispersal stochasticity
   quickens invasions, (2) greater demographic stochasticity slows
   invasions, (3) negative density-dependence slows invasions, and (4)
   greater temporal dispersal stochasticity quickens invasions. We prove
   the first three results by using generating functions and
   stochastic-dominance methods to rank furthest-forward dispersal
   distributions. The fourth result is proven in the special case of
   atomless theory, but remains an open conjecture in atomic theory. In
   addition, we explain why, unlike atomless invasions, an infinitely wide
   atomic invasion in two-dimensions can travel faster than a finite-width
   invasion and a one-dimensional invasion. The paper concludes with a
   classification of invasion dynamics based on dispersal kernel tails. (C)

Title = {Genetic demographic networks: Mathematical model and applications},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {111},
Pages = {75-86},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Recent improvement in the quality of genetic data obtained from extinct
   human populations and their ancestors encourages searching for answers
   to basic questions regarding human population history. The most common
   and successful are model-based approaches, in which genetic data are
   compared to the data obtained from the assumed demography model. Using
   such approach, it is possible to either validate or adjust assumed
   demography. Model fit to data can be obtained based on reverse-time
   coalescent simulations or forward-time simulations. In this paper we
   introduce a computational method based on mathematical equation that
   allows obtaining joint distributions of pairs of individuals under a
   specified demography model, each of them characterized by a genetic
   variant at a chosen locus. The two individuals are randomly sampled from
   either the same or two different populations. The model assumes three
   types of demographic events (split, merge and migration). Populations
   evolve according to the time continuous Moran model with drift and
   Markov-process mutation. This latter process is described by the
   Lyapunov-type equation introduced by O'Brien and generalized in our
   previous works. Application of this equation constitutes an original
   contribution. In the result section of the paper we present sample
   applications of our model to both simulated and literature-based
   demographies. Among other we include a study of the Slays-Baits-Finns
   genetic relationship, in which we model split and migrations between the
   Baits and Slays. We also include another example that involves the
   migration rates between farmers and hunters-gatherers, based on modern
   and ancient DNA samples. This latter process was previously studied
   using coalescent simulations. Our results are in general agreement with
   the previous method, which provides validation of our approach. Although
   our model is not an alternative to simulation methods in the practical
   sense, it provides an algorithm to compute pairwise distributions of
   alleles, in the case of haploid non-recombining loci such as
   mitochondrial and Y-chromosome loci in humans. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Title = {Genetic drift in populations governed by a Galton-Watson branching
   process},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {109},
Pages = {63-74},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Most population genetics studies have their origins in a Wright-Fisher
   or some closely related fixed population model in which each individual
   randomly chooses its ancestor. Populations which vary in size with time
   are typically modelled via a coalescent derived from Wright-Fisher, but
   use a nonlinear time-scaling driven by a deterministically imposed
   population growth. An alternate, arguably more realistic approach, and
   one which we take here, is to allow the population size to vary
   stochastically via a Galton-Watson branching process.
   We study genetic drift in a population consisting of a number of
   distinct allele types in which each allele type evolves as an
   independent Galton-Watson branching process. We find the dynamics of the
   population is determined by a single parameter kappa(0) =
   (2m(0)/sigma(2)) log lambda, where m(0) is the initial population size,
   lambda is the mean number of offspring per individual; and sigma(2) is
   the variance of the number of offspring. For 0 less than or similar to
   kappa(0) << 1, the dynamics are close to those of Wright-Fisher, with
   the added property that the population is prone to extinction. For
   kappa(0) >> 1 allele frequencies and ancestral lineages are stable and
   individual alleles do not fix throughout the population. The existence
   of a rapid changeover regime at kappa(0)approximate to 1 enables
   estimates to be made, together with confidence intervals, of the time
   and population size of the era of mitochondrial Eve. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Title = {<i>Wolbachia</i> spread dynamics in stochastic environments},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {106},
Pages = {32-44},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne viral disease with 100 million people
   infected annually. A novel strategy for dengue control uses the
   bacterium Wolbachia to invade dengue vector Aedes mosquitoes. As the
   impact of environmental heterogeneity on Wolbachia spread dynamics in
   natural areas has been rarely quantified, we develop a model of
   differential equations for which the environmental conditions switch
   randomly between two regimes. We find some striking phenomena that
   random regime transitions could drive Wolbachia to extinction from
   certain initial states confirmed Wolbachia fixation in homogeneous
   environments, and mosquito releasing facilitates Wolbachia invasion more
   effectively when the regimes transit frequently. By superimposing the
   phase spaces of the ODE systems defined in each regime, we identify the
   threshold curves below which Wolbachia invades the whole population,
   which extends the theory of threshold infection frequency to stochastic
   environments. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Sensitivity of quantitative traits to mutational effects and number of
   loci},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {102},
Pages = {85-93},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {When models of quantitative genetic variation are built from population
   genetic first principles, several assumptions are often made. One of the
   most important assumptions is that traits are controlled by many genes
   of small effect. This leads to a prediction of a Gaussian trait
   distribution in the population, via the Central Limit Theorem. Since
   these biological assumptions are often unknown or untrue, we
   characterized how finite numbers of loci or large mutational effects can
   impact the sampling distribution of a quantitative trait. To do so, we
   developed a neutral coalescent-based framework, allowing us to gain a
   detailed understanding of how number of loci and the underlying
   mutational model impacts the distribution of a quantitative trait.
   Through both analytical theory and simulation we found the normality
   assumption was highly sensitive to the details of the mutational
   process, with the greatest discrepancies arising when the number of loci
   was small or the mutational kernel was heavy-tailed. In particular,
   skewed mutational effects will produce skewed trait distributions and
   fat-tailed mutational kernels result in multimodal sampling
   distributions, even for traits controlled by a large number of loci.
   Since selection models and robust neutral models may produce
   qualitatively similar sampling distributions, we advise extra caution
   should be taken when interpreting model-based results for poorly
   understood systems of quantitative traits. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All

Title = {The influence of pleiotropy between viability and pollen fates on mating
   system evolution},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {99},
Pages = {7-17},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Floral displays are functionally and genetically integrated structures,
   so modifications to display will likely affect multiple fitness
   components (pleiotropy), including pollen export and self-pollination,
   and therefore selfing rate. Consequently, the great diversities of
   floral displays and of mating systems found among angiosperms have
   likely co-evolved. I extend previous models of mating system evolution
   to determine how pleiotropy that links viability (e.g., probability of
   survival to reproduction) and the allocation of pollen for export and
   selfing affects the evolution of selflng, outcrossing, and in
   particular, mixed mating. I show that the outcome depends on how pollen
   shifts from being exported, unused, or used for selfing. Furthermore,
   pleiotropy that affects viability can explain observations not addressed
   by previous theory, including the evolution of mixed mating despite high
   inbreeding depression in the absence of pollen-limitation. Therefore,
   pleiotropy may play a key role in explaining selfing rates for such
   species that exhibit otherwise enigmatic mating systems. (C) 2014

Title = {Improved maximum likelihood reconstruction of complex multi-generational
   pedigrees},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {97},
Pages = {11-19},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The reconstruction of pedigrees from genetic marker data is relevant to
   a wide range of applications. Likelihood-based approaches aim to find
   the pedigree structure that gives the highest probability to the
   observed data. Existing methods either entail an exhaustive search and
   are hence restricted to small numbers of individuals, or they take a
   more heuristic approach and deliver a solution that will probably have
   high likelihood but is not guaranteed to be optimal. By encoding the
   pedigree learning problem as an integer linear program we can exploit
   efficient optimisation algorithms to construct pedigrees guaranteed to
   have maximal likelihood for the standard situation where we have
   complete marker data at unlinked loci and segregation of genes from
   parents to offspring is Mendelian. Previous work demonstrated efficient
   reconstruction of pedigrees of up to about 100 individuals. The modified
   method that we present here is not so restricted: we demonstrate its
   applicability with simulated data on a real human pedigree structure of
   over 1600 individuals. It also compares well with a very competitive
   approximate approach in terms of solving time and accuracy. In addition
   to identifying a maximum likelihood pedigree, we can obtain any number
   of pedigrees in decreasing order of likelihood. This is useful for
   assessing the uncertainty of a maximum likelihood solution and permits
   model averaging over high likelihood pedigrees when this would be
   appropriate. More importantly, when the solution is not unique, as will
   often be the case for large pedigrees, it enables investigation into the
   properties of maximum likelihood pedigree estimates which has not been
   possible up to now. Crucially, we also have a means of assessing the
   behaviour of other approximate approaches which all aim to find a
   maximum likelihood solution. Our approach hence allows us to properly
   address the question of whether a reasonably high likelihood solution
   that is easy to obtain is practically as useful as a guaranteed maximum
   likelihood solution. The efficiency of our method on such large problems
   bodes well for extensions beyond the standard setting where some
   pedigree members may be latent, genotypes may be measured with error and
   markers may be linked. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Variation in moisture duration as a driver of coexistence by the storage
   effect in desert annual plants},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {92},
Pages = {36-50},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Temporal environmental variation is a leading hypothesis for the
   coexistence of desert annual plants. Environmental variation is
   hypothesized to cause species-specific patterns of variation in
   germination, which then generates the storage effect coexistence
   mechanism. However, it has never been shown how sufficient species
   differences in germination patterns for multispecies coexistence can
   arise from a shared fluctuating environment. Here we show that nonlinear
   germination responses to a single fluctuating physical environmental
   factor can lead to sufficient differences between species in germination
   pattern for the storage effect to yield coexistence of multiple species.
   We derive these nonlinear germination responses from experimental data
   on the effects of varying soil moisture duration. Although these
   nonlinearities lead to strong species asymmetries in germination
   patterns, the relative nonlinearity coexistence mechanism is minor
   compared with the storage effect. However, these asymmetries mean that
   the storage effect can be negative for some species, which then only
   persist in the face of interspecific competition through average fitness
   advantages. This work shows how a low dimensional physical environment
   can nevertheless stabilize multispecies coexistence when the species
   have different nonlinear responses to common conditions, as supported by
   our experimental data. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Economic epidemiology of avian influenza on smallholder poultry farms{*}},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {90},
Pages = {135-144},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) is often controlled through
   culling of poultry. Compensating farmers for culled chickens or ducks
   facilitates effective culling and control of HPAI. However, ensuing
   price shifts can create incentives that alter the disease dynamics of
   HPAI. Farmers control certain aspects of the dynamics by setting a farm
   size, implementing infection control measures, and determining the age
   at which poultry are sent to market. Their decisions can be influenced
   by the market price of poultry which can, in turn, be set by policy
   makers during an HPAI outbreak. Here, we integrate these economic
   considerations into an epidemiological model in which epidemiological
   parameters are determined by an outside agent (the farmer) to maximize
   profit from poultry sales. Our model exhibits a diversity of behaviors
   which are sensitive to (i) the ability to identify infected poultry,
   (ii) the average price of infected poultry, (iii) the basic reproductive
   number of avian influenza, (iv) the effect of culling on the market
   price of poultry, (v) the effect of market price on farm size, and (vi)
   the effect of poultry density on disease transmission. We find that
   under certain market and epidemiological conditions, culling can
   increase farm size and the total number of HPAI infections. Our model
   helps to inform the optimization of public health outcomes that best
   weigh the balance between public health risk and beneficial economic
   outcomes for farmers. (c) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Title = {Characteristics of the variance effective population size over time
   using an age structured model with variable size},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {90},
Pages = {91-103},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The variance effective population size (N-ev) is a key concept in
   population biology, because it quantifies the microevolutionary process
   of random genetic drift, and understanding the characteristics of N-ev
   is thus of central importance. Current formulas for Nev for populations
   with overlapping generations weight age classes according to their
   reproductive values (i.e. reflecting the contribution of genes from
   separate age classes to the population growth) to obtain a correct
   measure of genetic drift when computing the variance of the allele
   frequency change over time. In this paper, we examine the effect of
   applying different weights to the age classes using a novel analytical
   approach for exploring N-ev. We consider a haploid organism with
   overlapping generations and populations of increasing, declining, or
   constant expected size and stochastic variation with respect to the
   number of individuals in the separate age classes. We define Nov, as a
   function of how the age classes are weighted, and of the span between
   the two points in time, when measuring allele frequency change. With
   this model, time profiles for N-ev can be calculated for populations
   with various life histories and with fluctuations in life history
   composition, using different weighting schemes. We examine analytically
   and by simulations when Nei, using a weighting scheme with respect to
   reproductive contribution of separate age classes, accurately reflect
   the variance of the allele frequency change due to genetic drift over
   time. We show that the discrepancy of N-ev, calculated with reproductive
   values as weights, compared to when individuals are weighted equally,
   tends to a constant when the time span between the two measurements
   increases. This constant is zero only for a population with a constant
   expected population size. Our results confirm that the effect of
   ignoring overlapping generations, when empirically assessing Nell from
   allele frequency shifts, gets smaller as the time interval between
   samples increases. Our model has empirical applications including
   assessment of (i) time intervals necessary to permit ignoring the effect
   of overlapping generations for N-ev estimation by means of the temporal
   method, and (ii) effects of life table manipulation on N-ev over varying
   time periods. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Phase-type distributions in mathematical population genetics: An
   emerging framework},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {157},
Pages = {14-32},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {A phase -type distribution is the time to absorption in a continuous- or
   discrete -time Markov chain. Phasetype distributions can be used as a
   general framework to calculate key properties of the standard coalescent
   model and many of its extensions. Here, the `phases' in the phase -type
   distribution correspond to states in the ancestral process. For example,
   the time to the most recent common ancestor and the total branch length
   are phase -type distributed. Furthermore, the site frequency spectrum
   follows a multivariate discrete phase -type distribution and the joint
   distribution of total branch lengths in the two -locus coalescent
   -withrecombination model is multivariate phase -type distributed. In
   general, phase -type distributions provide a powerful mathematical
   framework for coalescent theory because they are analytically tractable
   using matrix manipulations. The purpose of this review is to explain the
   phase -type theory and demonstrate how the theory can be applied to
   derive basic properties of coalescent models. These properties can then
   be used to obtain insight into the ancestral process, or they can be
   applied for statistical inference. In particular, we show the relation
   between classical first -step analysis of coalescent models and phase
   -type calculations. We also show how reward transformations in phase
   -type theory lead to easy calculation of covariances and correlation
   coefficients between e.g. tree height, tree length, external branch
   length, and internal branch length. Furthermore, we discuss how these
   quantities can be used for statistical inference based on estimating
   equations. Providing an alternative to previous work based on the
   Laplace transform, we derive likelihoods for small -size coalescent
   trees based on phase -type theory. Overall, our main aim is to
   demonstrate that phasetype distributions provide a convenient general
   set of tools to understand aspects of coalescent models that are
   otherwise difficult to derive. Throughout the review, we emphasize the
   versatility of the phase -type framework, which is also illustrated by
   our accompanying R -code. All our analyses and figures can be reproduced
   from code available on GitHub.},

Title = {Bernoulli factories and duality in Wright-Fisher and Allen-Cahn models
   of population genetics},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {156},
Pages = {40-45},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Mathematical models of genetic evolution often come in pairs, connected
   by a so-called duality relation. The most seminal example are the
   Wright-Fisher diffusion and the Kingman coalescent, where the former
   describes the stochastic evolution of neutral allele frequencies in a
   large population forwards in time, and the latter describes the genetic
   ancestry of randomly sampled individuals from the population backwards
   in time. As well as providing a richer description than either model in
   isolation, duality often yields equations satisfied by quantities of
   interest. We employ the so-called Bernoulli factory - a celebrated tool
   in simulation-based computing - to derive duality relations for broad
   classes of genetics models. As concrete examples, we present
   Wright-Fisher diffusions with general drift functions, and Allen-Cahn
   equations with general, nonlinear forcing terms. The drift and forcing
   functions can be interpreted as the action of frequency-dependent
   selection. To our knowledge, this work is the first time a connection
   has been drawn between Bernoulli factories and duality in models of
   population genetics.},

   cooperative hunting},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {156},
Pages = {12-21},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Although cooperative hunting is widespread among animals, its benefits
   are unclear. At low frequencies, cooperative hunting may allow predators
   to escape competition and access bigger prey that could not be caught by
   a lone cooperative predator. Cooperative hunting is a more successful
   strategy when it is common, but its spread can result in overhunting big
   prey, which may have a lower per -capita growth rate than small prey. We
   construct a one -predator species, two -prey species model in which
   predators either learn to hunt small prey alone or learn to hunt big
   prey cooperatively. Predators first learn vertically from parents, then
   horizontally (i.e. socially) from random individuals or siblings. After
   horizontal transmission, they hunt with their learning partner if both
   are cooperative, and otherwise they hunt alone. Cooperative hunting
   cannot evolve when initially rare unless predators (a) interact with
   siblings, or (b) horizontally transmit the cooperative behavior to
   potential hunting partners. Whereas competition for small prey favors
   cooperative hunting when this cooperation is initially rare, the
   frequency of cooperative hunting cannot reach 100\% unless big prey is
   abundant. Furthermore, a mutant that increases horizontal learning can
   invade if cooperative hunting is present, but not at 100\%, because
   horizontal learning allows pairs of predators to have the same strategy.
   Our results reveal that the interactions between prey availability,
   social learning, and degree of cooperation among predators may have
   important effects on ecosystems.},

Title = {Parentage exclusion of close relatives in haplodiploid species},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {154},
Pages = {40-50},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Parentage exclusion probability is usually calculated to evaluate the
   informativeness of a set of markers for, and the statistical power of, a
   parentage analysis. Equations for parentage exclusion probability have
   been derived in various scenarios such as paternity exclusion when
   maternity is known or unknown or when candidate males are unrelated or
   loosely related (being from the same subpopulation) to the father. All
   previous work assumes a diploid species. Although marker-based parentage
   analyses have been conducted in haploidiploid species (such as ants,
   bees and wasps) for diploid offspring at the individual level or haploid
   offspring at the class level, rigorously derived formulations of
   parentage exclusion probability for haploid offspring at the individual
   level are lacking, which prevents the precise evaluation of the
   informativeness for and the statistical power of a parentage analysis.
   In this study we derive equations for the exclusion probability of
   maternity of a haploid male when multiple mother candidates (workers or
   queens) are unrelated or fullsibs to the mother. The usefulness of the
   equations is exemplified by numerical examples, and the results are
   discussed in the context of the study of worker reproductivity in
   eusocial haplodiploid species. The results are especially valuable for
   an optimal experimental design in determining sampling intensities (e.g.
   number of markers and number of individuals) to achieve satisfactory
   statistical power of a parentage analysis in investigating workers'
   reproductivity in eusocial haplodiploid species.Crown Copyright \& COPY;

Title = {Recoverability of ancestral recombination graph topologies},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Recombination is a powerful evolutionary process that shapes the genetic
   diversity observed in the populations of many species. Reconstructing
   genealogies in the presence of recombination from sequencing data is a
   very challenging problem, as this relies on mutations having occurred on
   the correct lineages in order to detect the recombination and resolve
   the ordering of coalescence events in the local trees. We investigate
   the probability of reconstructing the true topology of ancestral
   recombination graphs (ARGs) under the coalescent with recombination and
   gene conversion. We explore how sample size and mutation rate affect the
   inherent uncertainty in reconstructed ARGs, which sheds light on the
   theoretical limitations of ARG reconstruction methods. We illustrate our
   results using estimates of evolutionary rates for several organisms; in
   particular, we find that for parameter values that are realistic for
   SARS-CoV-2, the probability of reconstructing genealogies that are close
   to the truth is low. (c) 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

Title = {Evolutionary dynamics of dispersal and local adaptation in
   multi-resource landscapes},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {153},
Pages = {102-110},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Dispersal can enable access to resources in new locations. Consequently,
   traits that govern dispersal probability and dispersal distance may
   impact an individual's ability to acquire resources. However, spatial
   variation in the quality or quantity of resources may mediate potential
   adaptive benefits of novel dispersal traits. Ecological traits (i.e.,
   those that determine how an individual processes resources) will also,
   by definition, affect how an individual interacts with the resource
   landscape. In a spatially heterogeneous environment, this creates
   potential for evolutionary feedbacks between dispersal-related traits
   and ecological traits. For example, dispersal may introduce individuals
   to novel resources, at which point there may be selection for local
   adaptation of ecological traits. Conversely, an individual's ability to
   utilize different resource types may determine how dispersal impacts
   fitness. Here, we develop an individual-based model to investigate
   co-evolution of dispersal and ecological traits in a landscape where
   multiple resources vary independently across space. We find that: (1)
   resource specialists can emerge and tend to evolve dispersal strategies
   suited to the structure of their preferred resource type and (2)
   generalists, when they emerge, tend to possess intermediate dispersal
   strategies. Lastly, we note that the effect of dispersal on the
   evolution of the ecological trait is weaker than vice versa and, as a
   result, appreciable heterogeneity in the abundance of resources across a
   landscape will likely obscure a signal of co-evolution. \& COPY; 2023

Title = {Adaptation of a quantitative trait to a changing environment: New
   analytical insights on the asexual and infinitesimal sexual models},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {152},
Pages = {1-22},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Predicting the adaptation of populations to a changing environment is
   crucial to assess the impact of human activities on biodiversity. Many
   theoretical studies have tackled this issue by modeling the evolution of
   quantitative traits subject to stabilizing selection around an optimal
   phenotype, whose value is shifted continuously through time. In this
   context, the population fate results from the equilibrium distribution
   of the trait, relative to the moving optimum. Such a distribution may
   vary with the shape of selection, the system of reproduction, the number
   of loci, the mutation kernel or their interactions. Here, we develop a
   methodology that provides quantitative measures of population
   maladaptation and potential of survival directly from the entire profile
   of the phenotypic distribution, without any a priori on its shape. We
   investigate two different systems of reproduction (asexual and
   infinitesimal sexual models of inheritance), with various forms of
   selection. In particular, we recover that fitness functions such that
   selection weakens away from the optimum lead to evolutionary tipping
   points, with an abrupt collapse of the population when the speed of
   environmental change is too high. Our unified framework allows
   deciphering the mechanisms that lead to this phenomenon. More generally,
   it allows discussing similarities and discrepancies between the two
   systems of reproduction, which are ultimately explained by different
   constraints on the evolution of the phenotypic variance. We demonstrate
   that the mean fitness in the population crucially depends on the shape
   of the selection function in the infinitesimal sexual model, in contrast
   with the asexual model. In the asexual model, we also investigate the
   effect of the mutation kernel and we show that kernels with higher
   kurtosis tend to reduce maladaptation and improve fitness, especially in
   fast changing environments.(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {The curse of the plateau. Measuring confidence in human mortality
   estimates at extreme ages},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {144},
Pages = {24-36},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {In recent years, the importance of describing mortality at the limits of
   the life span has led to a number of relevant and controversial studies.
   Whereas considerable efforts have been devoted to collecting data and
   estimating models on the oldest-old individuals, the testing of
   statistical confidence about the conclusions of analyses at extreme ages
   has been largely neglected. How certain can we be in saying that the
   risk of dying increases, levels out, or, paradoxically, decreases over
   age 105? Can we recognize particular mortality age patterns at such high
   ages? In this paper, it is shown that very little can be confidently
   asserted about mortality at extreme ages. Instead of analyzing actual
   data, we perform a series of simulation studies mimicking actual
   scenarios from controlled mechanisms. Our findings are thus robust with
   respect to factors such as particular observation schemes,
   heterogeneity, and data quality issues. Given the sample sizes currently
   available and the levels of mortality experienced in present
   populations, we show that before age 110, only a Gompertzian increase of
   mortality may be detected. Afterwards a plateau will be regularly
   recognized as the most suitable pattern, regardless of the complexity of
   the true underlying mortality. (C) 2022 The Author(s). Published by

Volume = {143},
Pages = {92-104},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {We study a finite population of individuals evolving through mutation
   and selection. We generalize the Eigen quasispecies model to a finite
   population with the Moran model. This model also presents an asymptotic
   phase transition, and a proper definition of the critical parameter is
   discussed. We retrieve the same expression for the error threshold
   appearing in the Eigen model along with a correction term due to the
   finiteness of the population. To achieve this, we estimate the average
   lifetime of master sequences and find it grows like an exponential in
   the size of the population. Our technique consists in bounding from
   above and below the number of master sequences in the Moran model by two
   simpler birth and death chains. The expectation of this lifetime is then
   computed with the help of explicit formulas which are in turn expanded
   with Laplace method. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Bifurcations and hydra effects in Bazykin's predator-prey model},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {140},
Pages = {44-53},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {We consider Bazykin's model to address harvesting induced stability
   exchanges through bifurcation analysis. We examine the existence of
   hydra effects and analyze the stock pattern under predator harvesting.
   Prey harvesting cannot produce hydra effects in our model, whereas
   predator harvesting may cause multiple hydra effects. Our study reveals
   that type II response function and mutual interference among predators
   jointly induce multiple hydra effects and bistability. Bifurcations such
   as single Hopf-bifurcation, multiple Hopf-bifurcations and multiple
   saddle-node bifurcations appear for increasing harvesting rate on the
   predators. However, over-exploitation of the predators cannot generate
   any such bifurcation in our study. In simulations, the maximum
   sustainable yield (MSY) exists at a globally stable state. When predator
   is culled under increasing effort, basin of attraction of the
   equilibrium corresponding to the higher predator stock gets expanded,
   which alternatively is in favor of stock benefit for predators. The
   ecological theory developed in this study might be useful to understand
   conservation policy and fishery management. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {An early question in evolutionary theory asked why frequency
   distributions of taxonomic group sizes exhibit ``hollow curves{''} so
   frequently. An answer to this question was provided by G. Udny Yule's
   seminal contribution introducing a discrete model for those
   distributions. But Yule observed that the fit of his model to observed
   distributions was sometimes imperfect, in particular for the class of
   reptiles. The present study introduces a multi-epoch extension of the
   discrete Yule model that accounts for unobserved extinction of ancient
   lineages. The multi-epoch model is described as a Pelya urn embedded in
   a continuous-time branching process with an harmonic sequence of
   diversification rates. The main results include equivalent descriptions
   of multi-epoch models, their probability distributions, expected values,
   tail behavior and a self-similarity property. As an illustration of the
   theory, the multi-epoch model is applied to study the taxonomic
   diversity of reptile species, and provides a much better fit to the
   observed distribution of species than the original discrete Yule model.

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Spatiotemporal variations of natural selection may influence the
   evolution of various features of organisms such as local adaptation or
   specialisation. This article develops a method for inferring how
   selection varies between locations and between generations from
   phenotypic data. It is assumed that generations are non-overlapping and
   that individuals reproduce by selfing or asexually. A quantitative
   genetics model taking account of the effects of stabilising natural
   selection, the environment and mutation on phenotypic means and
   variances is developed. Explicit results on the evolution of populations
   are derived and used to develop a Bayesian inference method. The latter
   is applied to simulated data and to data from a wheat participatory
   plant breeding programme. It has some ability to infer evolutionary
   parameters, but estimates may be sensitive to prior distributions, for
   example when phenotypic time series are short and when environmental
   effects are large. In such cases, sensitivity to prior distributions may
   be reported or more data may be collected. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All

Title = {Asymmetric competition, ontogenetic growth and size inequality drive the
   difference in productivity between two-strata and one-stratum forest
   stands},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {130},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Size inequality has been considered a key feature of plant population
   structure with impacts on ecosystem functions. In forest ecosystems,
   studies examining the relationship between tree size inequality and
   stand productivity have produced mixed outcomes. These studies found
   positive, neutral or negative relationships and discussed how this could
   be influenced by competition for light between trees (e.g. light
   interception efficiency), but far less attention has been paid to the
   role played by tree ontogenetic growth. In this article, we present a
   simple mathematical model that predicts the basal area growth of a
   two-strata stand as a function of tree basal areas and asymmetric
   competition. Comparing the growth of this stand to the growth of a
   spatially homogeneous one-stratum stand and a spatially heterogeneous
   one-stratum stand, we show that higher growth of the two-strata stand is
   achieved for concave shape, increasing functions of ontogenetic growth
   and for low intensities of absolute size-asymmetric competition. We also
   demonstrate that the difference in growth between the two-strata stand
   and the one-stratum stands depends on tree size inequality, mean tree
   basal area and total basal area in the two-strata stand. We finally
   found that the relationships between tree size inequality and
   productivity can vary from positive to negative and even non-monotonous.
   However, we highlight that negative relationships may be more frequent.
   As a conclusion, our results indicate that ontogenetic growth can have a
   major impact on the form and the magnitude of the size inequality
   productivity relationship. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {We propose a stochastic model of cultural evolution in a hunter-gatherer
   population that is subdivided into demes (subpopulations) of variable
   size and distributed over a finite or infinite number of sites. We
   assume a skill acquirable by either social or individual learning, such
   as the know how for positive niche construction, which raises the
   carrying capacity of a site. We further assume a positive feedback
   between the number of individuals in a deme with the skill and the size
   of that deme, which entails that, for most of the time, a deme will
   either be small and include few skilled individuals or large and include
   many skilled individuals. Our principal goal is to examine the effect of
   the migration rate among sites, a measure of their connectedness, on the
   frequency and duration of shifts to the
   large-demeimany-skilled-individuals condition that simultaneously
   involve many demes. We find that the frequency of these concerted shifts
   is maximized at an intermediate migration rate, whereas their mean
   duration is monotone increasing in the migration rate. Finally, we use
   these theoretical predictions to interpret the Still Bay and Howiesons
   Poort industries, which are believed to have had spatially-synchronous
   and widespread distributions of relatively short duration in southern
   Africa. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Cultural and evolutionary dynamics with best-of-k learning when payoffs
   are uncertain},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {128},
Pages = {27-38},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Social learning not only takes the form of random copying of other
   individuals, but also involves learners' choice of what to learn or from
   whom to learn. Best-of-k learning refers to a kind of success-biased
   social learning strategy in which a learner randomly samples k exemplars
   from the population and imitates the most ``successful{''} one, or the
   one gaining the highest payoff. While it is intuitive that best-of-k
   learning can promote the spread of superior variants and thereby enable
   cumulative cultural evolution, a previous mathematical analysis has
   shown that it may sometimes result in maladaptive cultural evolution
   when the payoffs associated with cultural variants vary stochastically.
   If so, best-of-k learners may be selectively disfavored and in the long
   run replaced by unbiased learners, who simply copy someone chosen at
   random. Here we develop new mathematical models that are more simplified
   and mathematically tractable than the previous model to achieve a fuller
   analysis of cultural and evolutionary dynamics involving best-of-k
   learning and stochastic payoffs. We find that best-of-k learning, unlike
   unbiased learning, can facilitate the invasion of an on average inferior
   variant that sometimes gives a very high payoff, destabilize a
   population fixed with a variant that is on average superior but
   occasionally results in a very low payoff, and maintain cultural
   polymorphism at equilibrium. Considering gene-culture coevolution of
   learning rules and cultural variants, under the assumption that social
   learning is always faithful, it is shown that a population of best-of-k
   learners at the culturally polymorphic state can always be invaded by
   unbiased learners and eventually converges to a culturally monomorphic
   state. Nonetheless, we show that best-of-k learning can be stable
   against invasion by unbiased learning if social learning is sometimes
   combined with individual learning. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Inc.},

Title = {Single and simultaneous binary mergers in Wright-Fisher genealogies},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {121},
Pages = {60-71},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The Kingman coalescent is a commonly used model in genetics, which is
   often justified with reference to the Wright-Fisher (WF) model. Current
   proofs of convergence of WF and other models to the Kingman coalescent
   assume a constant sample size. However, sample sizes have become quite
   large in human genetics. Therefore, we develop a convergence theory that
   allows the sample size to increase with population size. If the haploid
   population size is N and the sample size is N1/3-epsilon, epsilon > 0,
   we prove that Wright-Fisher genealogies involve at most a single binary
   merger in each generation with probability converging to 1 in the limit
   of large N. Single binary merger or no merger in each generation of the
   genealogy implies that the Kingman partition distribution is obtained
   exactly. If the sample size is N1/3-epsilon, Wright-Fisher genealogies
   may involve simultaneous binary mergers in a single generation but do
   not involve triple mergers in the large N limit. The asymptotic theory
   is verified using numerical calculations. Variable population sizes are
   handled algorithmically. It is found that even distant bottlenecks can
   increase the probability of triple mergers as well as simultaneous
   binary mergers in WF genealogies. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {Consequences of an uncertain mass mortality regime triggered by climate
   variability on giant clam population management in the Pacific Ocean},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {119},
Pages = {37-47},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Despite actions to manage sustainably tropical Pacific Ocean reef
   fisheries, managers have faced failures and frustrations because of
   unpredicted mass mortality events triggered by climate variability. The
   consequences of these events on the long-term population dynamics of
   living resources need to be better understood for better management
   decisions. Here, we use a giant clam (Tridacna maxima) spatially
   explicit population model to compare the efficiency of several
   management strategies under various scenarios of natural mortality,
   including mass mortality due to climatic anomalies. The model was
   parameterized by in situ estimations of growth and mortality and fishing
   effort, and was validated by historical and new in situ surveys of giant
   clam stocks in two French Polynesia lagoons. Projections on the long run
   (100 years) suggested that the best management strategy was a decrease
   of fishing pressure through quota implementation, regardless of the
   mortality regime considered. In contrast, increasing the minimum legal
   size of catch and closing areas to fishing were less efficient. When
   high mortality occurred due to climate variability, the efficiency of
   all management scenarios decreased markedly. Simulating El Nifio
   Southern Oscillation event by adding temporal autocorrelation in natural
   mortality rates increased the natural variability of stocks, and also
   decreased the efficiency of management. These results highlight the
   difficulties that managers in small Pacific islands can expect in the
   future in the face of global warming, climate anomalies and new mass
   mortalities. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {An information theoretic approach to pedigree reconstruction},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {107},
Number = {SI},
Pages = {52-64},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Network structure is a dominant feature of many biological systems, both
   at the cellular level and within natural populations. Advances in
   genotype and gene expression screening made over the last few decades
   have permitted the reconstruction of these networks. However, resolution
   to a single model estimate will generally not be possible, leaving open
   the question of the appropriate method of formal statistical inference.
   The nonstandard structure of the problem precludes most traditional
   statistical methodologies. Alternatively, a Bayesian approach provides a
   natural methodology for formal inference. Construction of a posterior
   density on the space of network structures allows formal inference
   regarding features of network structure using specific marginal
   posterior distributions.
   An information theoretic approach to this problem will be described,
   based on the Minimum Description Length principle. This leads to a
   Bayesian inference model based on the information content of data rather
   than on more commonly used probabilistic models. The approach is applied
   to the problem of pedigree reconstruction based on genotypic data. Using
   this application, it is shown how the MDL approach is able to provide a
   truly objective control for model complexity.
   A two-cohort model is used for a simulation study. The MDL approach is
   compared to COLONY-2, a well known pedigree reconstruction application.
   The study highlights the problem of genotyping error modeling. COLONY-2
   requires prior error rate estimates, and its accuracy proves to be
   highly sensitive to these estimates. In contrast, the MDL approach does
   not require prior error rate estimates, and is able to accurately adjust
   for genotyping error across the range of models considered. (C) 2015

Title = {The arrested immunity hypothesis in an immunoepidemiological model of
   Chlamydia transmission},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {93},
Pages = {52-62},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {For curable infectious diseases, public health strategies such as
   treatment can effectively shorten an individual's infectious period, and
   thus limit their role in transmission. However, because treatment
   effectively eliminates antigen impingement, these types of control
   strategies may also paradoxically impair the development of adaptive
   immune responses. For sexually transmitted Chlamydia trachomatis
   infections, this latter effect has been coined the arrested immunity
   hypothesis, and is discussed to carry significant epidemiological
   implications for those individuals who return to similar sexual networks
   with similar sexual behavior. Here, we examine the effect of antibiotic
   treatment on the spread of Chlamydia infection through a simple
   immunoepidemiological framework that characterizes the population as a
   collection of dynamically evolving individuals in small, paradigmatic
   networks. Within each individual there is an explicit representation of
   pathogen replication, accumulation and persistence of an immune
   response, followed by a gradual waning of that response once the
   infection is cleared. Individuals are then nested in networks, allowing
   the variability in the life history of their infection to be functions
   of both individual immune dynamics as well as their position in the
   network. Model results suggest that the timing and coverage of treatment
   are important contributors to the development of immunity and
   reinfection. In particular, the impact of treatment on the spread of
   infection between individuals can be beneficial, have no effect, or be
   deleterious depending on who is treated and when. Although we use
   sexually transmitted Chlamydia infection as an example, the observed
   results arise endogenously from a basic model structure, and thus
   warrant consideration to understanding the interaction of infection,
   treatment, and spread of other infectious, diseases. (c) 2014 Elsevier

Title = {A dynamic model of the marriage market-Part 1: Matching algorithm based
   on age preference and availability},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {88},
Pages = {78-85},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The matching algorithm in a dynamic marriage market model is described
   in this first of two companion papers. Iterative Proportional Fitting is
   used to find a marriage function (an age distribution of new marriages
   for both sexes), in a stable reference population, that is consistent
   with the one-sex age distributions of new marriages, and includes age
   preference. The one-sex age distributions (which are the marginals of
   the two-sex distribution) are based on the Picrate model, and age
   preference on a normal distribution, both of which may be adjusted by
   choice of parameter values. For a population that is perturbed from the
   reference state, the total number of new marriages is found as the
   harmonic mean of target totals for men and women obtained by applying
   reference population marriage rates to the perturbed population. The
   marriage function uses the age preference function, assumed to be the
   same for the reference and the perturbed populations, to distribute the
   total number of new marriages. The marriage function also has an
   availability factor that varies as the population changes with time,
   where availability depends on the supply of unmarried men and women. To
   simplify exposition, only first marriage is treated, and the algorithm
   is illustrated by application to Zambia. In the second paper, remarriage
   and dissolution are included. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {84},
Pages = {1-8},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The evolution of social behavior has been the focus of many theoretical
   investigations, which typically have assumed infinite populations and
   specific payoff structures. This paper explores the evolution of social
   behavior in a finite population using a general n-player game. First, we
   classify social behaviors in a group of n individuals based on their
   effects on the actor's and the social partner's payoffs, showing that in
   general such classification is possible only for a given composition of
   strategies in the group. Second, we introduce a novel transformation of
   payoffs in the general n-player game to formulate explicitly the effects
   of a social behavior on the actor's and the social partners' payoffs.
   Third, using the transformed payoffs, we derive the conditions for a
   social behavior to be favored by natural selection in a well-mixed
   population and in the presence of multilevel selection. (C) 2012

Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {156},
Pages = {93-102},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Given a labeled tree topology t , consider a population P of k leaves
   chosen among those of t. The clade of P is the minimal subtree of t
   containing P and its size is given by the number of leaves in the clade.
   When t is selected under the Yule or uniform distribution among the
   labeled topologies of size n , we study the ``clade size{''}random
   variable determining closed formulas for its probability mass function,
   its mean, and its variance. Our calculations show that for large n the
   clade size tends to be smaller under the uniform model than under the
   Yule model, with a larger variability in the first scenario for values
   of k >= 5. We apply our probability formulas to investigate
   set-theoretic relationships between the clades of two populations in a
   random tree, determining how likely one clade is contained in or it is
   equal to the other. Our study relates to earlier calculations for the
   probability that under the Yule model the clade size of P equals the
   size of P - that is, the population P forms a monophyletic group - and
   extends known results for the probability that the minimal (non-trivial)
   clade containing a random taxon has a given size.},

Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},

Pages = {50-68},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Research shows that geographic disparities in life expectancy between
   leading and lagging states are increasing over time while racial
   disparities between Black and White Americans have been going down. In
   the 65+ age strata morbidity is the most common cause of death, making
   differences in morbidity and associated adverse health-related outcomes
   between advantaged and disadvantaged groups an important aspect of
   disparities in life expectancy at age 65 (LE65). In this study, we used
   Pollard's decomposition to evaluate the disease-related contributions to
   disparities in LE65 for two types of data with distinctly differing
   structures: population/registry and administrative claims. To do so, we
   analyzed Pollard's integral, which is exact by construction, and
   developed exact analytic solutions for both types of data without the
   need for numerical integration. The solutions are broadly applicable and
   easily implemented. Applying these solutions, we found that the largest
   relative contributions to geographic disparities in LE65 were chronic
   lower respiratory diseases, circulatory diseases, and lung cancer; and,
   to racial disparities: arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and
   cerebrovascular diseases. Overall, the increase in LE65 observed over
   1998-2005 and 2010-2017 was primarily due to a reduction in the
   contributions of acute and chronic ischemic diseases; this was partially
   offset by increased contributions of diseases of the nervous system
   including dementia and Alzheimer's disease.\& COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

Title = {A central limit theorem concerning uncertainty in estimates of
   individual admixture},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {148},
Pages = {28-39},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The concept of individual admixture (IA) assumes that the genome of
   individuals is composed of alleles inherited from K ancestral
   populations. Each copy of each allele has the same chance qk to
   originate from population k, and together with the allele frequencies p
   in all populations at all M markers, comprises the admixture model.
   Here, we assume a supervised scheme, i.e. allele frequencies p are given
   through a reference database of size N, and q is estimated via maximum
   likelihood for a single sample. We study laws of large numbers and
   central limit theorems describing effects of finiteness of both, M and
   N, on the estimate of q. We recall results for the effect of finite M,
   and provide a central limit theorem for the effect of finite N,
   introduce a new way to express the uncertainty in estimates in standard
   barplots, give simulation results, and discuss applications in forensic
   genetics. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Limiting distribution of X-chromosomal coalescence times under
   first-cousin consanguineous mating},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {147},
Pages = {1-15},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {By providing additional opportunities for coalescence within families,
   the presence of consanguineous unions in a population reduces
   coalescence times relative to non-consanguineous populations.
   First-cousin consanguinity can take one of six forms differing in the
   configuration of sexes in the pedigree of the male and female cousins
   who join in a consanguineous union: patrilateral parallel, patrilateral
   cross, matrilateral parallel, matrilateral cross, bilateral parallel,
   and bilateral cross. Considering populations with each of the six types
   of first-cousin consanguinity individually and a population with a
   mixture of the four unilateral types, we examine coalescent models of
   consanguinity. We previously computed, for first-cousin consanguinity
   models, the mean coalescence time for X-chromosomal loci and the
   limiting distribution of coalescence times for autosomal loci. Here, we
   use the separation-of-time-scales approach to obtain the limiting
   distribution of coalescence times for X-chromosomal loci. This limiting
   distribution has an instantaneous coalescence probability that depends
   on the probability that a union is consanguineous; lineages that do not
   coalesce instantaneously coalesce according to an exponential
   distribution. We study the effects on the coalescence time distribution
   of the type of first-cousin consanguinity, showing that
   patrilateral-parallel and patrilateral-cross consanguinity have no
   effect on X-chromosomal coalescence time distributions and that
   matrilateral-parallel consanguinity decreases coalescence times to a
   greater extent than does matrilateral-cross consanguinity. (C) 2022

Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},

Volume = {145},
Pages = {80-94},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Gene gain-loss-duplication models are commonly based on continuous-time
   birth-death processes. Employed in a phylogenetic context, such models
   have been increasingly popular in studies of gene content evolution
   across multiple genomes. While the applications are becoming more varied
   and demanding, bioinformatics methods for probabilistic inference on
   copy numbers (or integer-valued evolutionary characters, in general) are
   scarce.\& nbsp;\& nbsp;We describe a flexible probabilistic framework
   for phylogenetic gain-loss-duplication models. The framework is based on
   a novel elementary representation by dependent random variables with
   well-characterized conditional distributions: binomial, Polya (negative
   binomial), and Poisson.\& nbsp;The corresponding graphical model yields
   exact numerical procedures for computing the likelihood and the
   posterior distribution of ancestral copy numbers. The resulting
   algorithms take quadratic time in the total number of copies. In
   addition, we show how the likelihood gradient can be computed by a
   linear-time algorithm. (C)\& nbsp;2022 Published by Elsevier Inc.},

Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},

Volume = {139},
Pages = {1-17},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In this article, a biallelic reversible mutation model with linear and
   quadratic selection is analysed. The approach reconnects to one proposed
   by Kimura (1979), who starts from a diffusion model and derives its
   equilibrium distribution up to a constant. We use a boundary-mutation
   Moran model, which approximates a general mutation model for small
   effective mutation rates, and derive its equilibrium distribution for
   polymorphic and monomorphic variants in small to moderately sized
   populations. Using this model, we show that biased mutation rates and
   linear selection alone can cause patterns of polymorphism within and
   substitution rates between populations that are usually ascribed to
   balancing or overdominant selection. We illustrate this using a data set
   of short introns and fourfold degenerate sites from Drosophila simulans
   and Drosophila melanogaster. (C) 2021 The Author(s). Published by

Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {134},
Pages = {1-14},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {A plausible biocontrol strategy for the eradication of invasive species
   involves augmenting wild populations with genetically modified
   supermales. Supermales contain double YY chromosomes. When they are
   augmented into a wild population, destabilization and eventual
   extinction occurs over time due to a strongly skewed gender ratio
   towards males. Here, we employ a mathematical model that considers an
   Allee effect, but we have discovered through simulation that the
   presence of supermales leads to an increase in the minimal number of
   females needed for survival at a value higher than the mathematically
   defined Allee effect. Using this effect, we focus our research on
   exploring the sensitivity of the optimized supply rate of supermale fish
   to the initial gender ratio and density of the wild populations. We find
   that the eradication strategy with optimized supply rate of supermales
   can be determined with knowledge of reproductive rate and survival
   fitness of supermale fish. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Some simple rules for estimating reproduction numbers in the presence of
   reservoir exposure or imported cases},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {134},
Pages = {182-194},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {For many diseases, the basic reproduction number (R-0) is a threshold
   parameter for disease extinction or survival in isolated populations.
   However no human population is fully isolated from other human or animal
   populations. We use compartmental models to derive simple rules for the
   basic reproduction number in populations where an endemic disease is
   sustained by a combination of local transmission within the population
   and exposure from some other source: either a reservoir exposure or
   imported cases. We introduce the idea of a reservoir-driven or
   importation-driven disease: diseases that would become extinct in the
   population of interest without reservoir exposure or imported cases
   (since R-0 < 1), but nevertheless may be sufficiently transmissible that
   many or most infections are acquired from humans in that population. We
   show that in the simplest case, R-0 < 1 if and only if the proportion of
   infections acquired from the external source exceeds the disease
   prevalence and explore how population heterogeneity and the interactions
   of multiple strains affect this rule. We apply these rules in two case
   studies of Clostridium difficile infection and colonisation: C.
   difficile in the hospital setting accounting for imported cases, and C.
   difficile in the general human population accounting for exposure to
   animal reservoirs. We demonstrate that even the hospital-adapted,
   highly-transmissible NAP1/RT027 strain of C. difficile had a
   reproduction number <1 in a landmark study of hospitalised patients and
   therefore was sustained by colonised and infected admissions to the
   study hospital. We argue that C. difficile should be considered
   reservoir-driven if as little as 13.0\% of transmission can be
   attributed to animal reservoirs. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {For a population to acquire a complex adaptation requiring multiple
   individually neutral mutations, it must cross a plateau in the fitness
   landscape. We consider plateaus involving three mutations, and show that
   large populations can cross them rapidly via lineages that acquire
   multiple mutations while remaining at low frequency, much faster than
   the proportional to mu(3) rate for simultaneous triple mutations.
   Plateau-crossing is fastest for very large populations. At intermediate
   population sizes, recombination can greatly accelerate adaptation by
   combining independent mutant lineages to form triple-mutants. For more
   frequent recombination, such that the population is kept near linkage
   equilibrium, we extend our analysis to find simple expressions for the
   expected time to cross plateaus of arbitrary width. (C) 2019 Elsevier

Abstract = {We consider the ancestral state reconstruction problem where we need to
   infer phenotypes of ancestors using observations from present-day
   species. For this problem, we propose a multi-task learning method that
   uses regularized maximum likelihood to estimate the ancestral states of
   various traits simultaneously. We then show both theoretically and by
   simulation that this method improves the estimates of the ancestral
   states compared to the maximum likelihood method. The result also
   indicates that for the problem of ancestral state reconstruction under
   the Brownian motion model, the maximum likelihood method can be
   improved. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

   species},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {112},
Pages = {43-51},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {When predicting the fate and consequences of recurring deleterious
   mutations in self-fertilising populations most models developed make the
   assumption that populations have discrete non overlapping generations.
   This makes them biologically irrelevant when considering perennial
   species with overlapping generations and where mating occurs
   independently of the age group. The few models studying the effect of
   perennial life-histories on the genetic properties of populations in the
   presence of self-fertilisation have done so considering age-dependent
   selection. They find low levels of inbreeding depression in perennial
   populations that do not explain empirical observations. Here we propose
   a simple deterministic model in continuous time with selection at
   different fitness traits and feedback between population fitness and
   size. We find that a perennial life-history can result in high levels of
   inbreeding depression in spite of inbreeding, due to higher frequencies
   of heterozygous individuals at the adult stage. We also propose that
   there may be demographic advantages for self-fertilisation that are
   independent of reproductive success. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {Effective sizes and time to migration-drift equilibrium in
   geographically subdivided populations},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {112},
Pages = {139-156},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Many versions of the effective population size (N-e) exist, and they are
   important in population genetics in order to quantify rates of change of
   various characteristics, such as inbreeding, heterozygosity, or allele
   frequencies. Traditionally, N-e was defined for single, isolated
   populations, but we have recently presented a mathematical framework for
   subdivided populations. In this paper we focus on diploid populations
   with geographic subdivision, and present new theoretical results. We
   compare the haploid and diploid versions of the inbreeding effective
   size (N-ei) with novel expression for the variance effective size
   (N-ev), and conclude that for local populations N-ev is often much
   smaller than both versions of Nei, whenever they exist. Global N(ev)of
   the metapopulation, on the other hand, is close to the haploid Net and
   much larger than the diploid Nei. We introduce a new effective size, the
   additive genetic variance effective size Neill', which is of particular
   interest for long term protection of species. It quantifies the rate at
   which additive genetic variance is lost and we show that this effective
   size is closely related to the haploid version of Nei. Finally, we
   introduce a new measure of a population's deviation from migration-drift
   equilibrium, and apply it to quantify the time it takes to reach this
   equilibrium. Our findings are of importance for understanding the
   concept of effective population size in substructured populations and
   many of the results have applications in conservation biology. (C) 2016

Title = {Assortative mating can impede or facilitate fixation of underdominant
   alleles},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {112},
Pages = {14-21},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Underdominant mutations have fixed between divergent species, yet
   classical models suggest that rare underdominant alleles are purged
   quickly except in small or subdivided populations. We predict that
   underdominant alleles that also influence mate choice, such as those
   affecting coloration patterns visible to mates and predators alike, can
   fix more readily. We analyze a mechanistic model of positive assortative
   mating in which individuals have n chances to sample compatible mates.
   This one-parameter model naturally spans random mating (n = 1) and
   complete assortment (n -> infinity), yet it produces sexual selection
   whose strength depends non-monotonically on n. This sexual selection
   interacts with viability selection to either inhibit or facilitate
   fixation. As mating opportunities increase, underdominant alleles fix as
   frequently as neutral mutations, even though sexual selection and
   underdominance independently each suppress rare alleles. This mechanism
   allows underdominant alleles to fix in large populations and illustrates
   how life history can affect evolutionary change. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Title = {The effect of <i>Wolbachia</i> on dengue outbreaks when dengue is
   repeatedly introduced},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {111},
Pages = {9-15},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Use of the Wolbachia bacterium is a proposed new strategy to reduce
   dengue transmission, which results in around 390 million individuals
   infected annually. In places with strong variations in climatic
   conditions such as temperature and rainfall, dengue epidemics generally
   occur only at a certain time of the year. Where dengue is not endemic,
   the time of year in which imported cases enter the population plays a
   crucial role in determining the likelihood of outbreak occurrence. We
   use a mathematical model to study the effects of Wolbachia on dengue
   transmission dynamics and dengue seasonality. We focus in regions where
   dengue is not endemic but can spread due to the presence of a dengue
   vector and the arrival of people with dengue on a regular basis. Our
   results show that the time-window in which outbreaks can occur is
   reduced in the presence of Wolbachia-carrying Aedes aegypti mosquitoes
   by up to six weeks each year. We find that Wolbachia reduces overall
   case numbers by up to 80\%. The strongest effect is obtained when the
   amplitude of the seasonal forcing is low (0.02-0.30). The benefits of
   Wolbachia also depend on the transmission rate, with the bacteria most
   effective at moderate transmission rates ranging between 0.08-0.12. Such
   rates are consistent with fitted estimates for Cairns, Australia. (C)

Title = {Comparing estimates of genetic variance across different relationship
   models},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {107},
Number = {SI},
Pages = {26-30},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Use of relationships between individuals to estimate genetic variances
   and heritabilities via mixed models is standard practice in human, plant
   and livestock genetics. Different models or information for
   relationships may give different estimates of genetic variances.
   However, comparing these estimates across different relationship models
   is not straightforward as the implied base populations differ between
   relationship models. In this work, I present a method to compare
   estimates of variance components across different relationship models. I
   suggest referring genetic variances obtained using different
   relationship models to the same reference population, usually a set of
   individuals in the population. Expected genetic variance of this
   population is the estimated variance component from the mixed model
   times a statistic, D-k, which is the average self-relationship minus the
   average (self- and across-) relationship. For most typical models of
   relationships, D-k is close to 1. However, this is not true for very
   deep pedigrees, for identity-by-state relationships, or for
   non-parametric kernels, which tend to overestimate the genetic variance
   and the heritability. Using mice data, I show that heritabilities from
   identity-by-state and kernel-based relationships are overestimated.
   Weighting these estimates by D-k scales them to a base comparable to
   genomic or pedigree relationships, avoiding wrong comparisons, for
   instance, ``missing heritabilities{''}. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All

Title = {Long-range dispersal, stochasticity and the broken accelerating wave of
   advance},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {100},
Pages = {39-55},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Rare long distance dispersal events are thought to have a
   disproportionate impact on the spread of invasive species. Modelling
   using integrodifference equations suggests that, when long distance
   contacts are represented by a fat-tailed dispersal kernel, an
   accelerating wave of advance can ensue. Invasions spreading in this
   manner could have particularly dramatic effects. Recently, various
   authors have suggested that demographic stochasticity disrupts wave
   acceleration. Integrodifference models have been widely used in movement
   ecology, and as such a clearer understanding of stochastic effects is
   needed. Here, we present a stochastic non-linear one-dimensional lattice
   model in which demographic stochasticity and the dispersal regime can be
   systematically varied. Extensive simulations show that stochasticity has
   a profound effect on model behaviour, and usually breaks acceleration
   for fat-tailed kernels. Exceptions are seen for some power law kernels,
   K(l) alpha vertical bar l vertical bar(-beta) with beta < 3, for which
   acceleration persists despite stochasticity. Such kernels lack a second
   moment and are important in `accelerating' phenomena such as Levy
   flights. Furthermore, for long-range kernels the approach to the
   continuum limit behaviour as stochasticity is reduced is generally slow.
   Given that real-world populations are finite, stochastic models may give
   better predictive power when long-range dispersal is important. Insights
   from mean-field models such as integrodifference equations should be
   applied with caution in such circumstances. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All

Title = {Alternative stable states and alternative endstates of community
   assembly through intra- and interspecific positive and negative
   interactions},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {96},
Pages = {8-18},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Positive and negative interactions within and between species may occur
   simultaneously, with the net effect depending on population densities.
   For instance, at low densities plants may ameliorate stress, while
   competition for resources dominates at higher densities. Here, we
   propose a simple two-species model in which con- and heterospecifics
   have a positive effect on per capita growth rate at low densities, while
   negative interactions dominate at high densities. The model thus
   includes both Allee effects (intraspecific positive effects) and
   mutualism (interspecific positive effects), as well as intra- and
   interspecific competition. Using graphical methods we derive conditions
   for alternative stable states and species coexistence. We show that
   mutual non-invasibility (i.e. the inability of each species to invade a
   population of the other) is more likely when species have a strong
   positive effect on the own species or a strong negative effect on the
   other species. Mutual non-invasibility implies alternative stable
   states, however, there may also be alternative stable states at which
   species coexist. In the case of species symmetry (i.e. when species are
   indistinguishable), such alternative coexistence states require that if
   the positive effect exerted at low densities at the own species is
   stronger than on the other species, the negative effect at higher
   densities is also stronger on the own species than on the other species,
   or, vice versa, if the interspecific positive effects at low densities
   are stronger than the intraspecific effects, the negative effects at
   higher densities are also stronger between species than within species.
   However, the reachability of alternative stable states is restricted by
   the frequency and density at which species are introduced during
   community assembly, so that alternative stable states do not always
   represent alternative endstates of community assembly. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Title = {Evolution of social versus individual learning in a subdivided
   population revisited: Comparative analysis of three coexistence
   mechanisms using the inclusive-fitness method},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {92},
Pages = {78-87},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Learning abilities are categorized into social (learning from others)
   and individual learning (learning on one's own). Despite the typically
   higher cost of individual learning, there are mechanisms that allow
   stable coexistence of both learning modes in a single population. In
   this paper, we investigate by means of mathematical modeling how the
   effect of spatial structure on evolutionary outcomes of pure social and
   individual learning strategies depends on the mechanisms for
   coexistence. We model a spatially structured population based on the
   infinite-island framework and consider three scenarios that differ in
   coexistence mechanisms. Using the inclusive-fitness method, we derive
   the equilibrium frequency of social learners and the genetic load of
   social learning (defined as average fecundity reduction caused by the
   presence of social learning) in terms of some summary statistics, such
   as relatedness, for each of the three scenarios and compare the results.
   This comparative analysis not only reconciles previous models that made
   contradictory predictions as to the effect of spatial structure on the
   equilibrium frequency of social learners but also derives a simple
   mathematical rule that determines the sign of the genetic load (i.e.
   whether or not social learning contributes to the mean fecundity of the
   population). (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {92},
Pages = {30-35},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The Wright-Fisher process with selection is an important tool in
   population genetics theory. Traditional analysis of this process relies
   on the diffusion approximation. The diffusion approximation is usually
   studied in a partial differential equations framework. In this paper, I
   introduce a path integral formalism to study the Wright-Fisher process
   with selection and use that formalism to obtain a simple perturbation
   series to approximate the transition density. The perturbation series
   can be understood in terms of Feynman diagrams, which have a simple
   probabilistic interpretation in terms of selective events. The
   perturbation series proves to be an accurate approximation of the
   transition density for weak selection and is shown to be arbitrarily
   accurate for any selection coefficient. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All

Title = {On learning dynamics underlying the evolution of learning rules},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {91},
Pages = {20-36},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In order to understand the development of non-genetically encoded
   actions during an animal's lifespan, it is necessary to analyze the
   dynamics and evolution of learning rules producing behavior. Owing to
   the intrinsic stochastic and frequency-dependent nature of learning
   dynamics, these rules are often studied in evolutionary biology via
   agent-based computer simulations. In this paper, we show that stochastic
   approximation theory can help to qualitatively understand learning
   dynamics and formulate analytical models for the evolution of learning
   rules. We consider a population of individuals repeatedly interacting
   during their lifespan, and where the stage game faced by the individuals
   fluctuates according to an environmental stochastic process. Individuals
   adjust their behavioral actions according to learning rules belonging to
   the class of experience-weighted attraction learning mechanisms, which
   includes standard reinforcement and Bayesian learning as special cases.
   We use stochastic approximation theory in order to derive differential
   equations governing action play probabilities, which turn out to have
   qualitative features of mutator-selection equations. We then perform
   agent-based simulations to find the conditions where the deterministic
   approximation is closest to the original stochastic learning process for
   standard 2-action 2-player fluctuating games, where interaction between
   learning rules and preference reversal may occur. Finally, we analyze a
   simplified model for the evolution of learning in a producer-scrounger
   game, which shows that the exploration rate can interact in a
   non-intuitive way with other features of co-evolving learning rules.
   Overall, our analyses illustrate the usefulness of applying stochastic
   approximation theory in the study of animal learning. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {85},
Pages = {49-57},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {In this study, we investigate the evolutionarily stable schedule of
   growth and sex allocation for marine benthic species that contain dwarf
   males. We consider a population in an ephemeral microhabitat that
   receives a constant supply of larvae. Small individuals can immediately
   reproduce as a dwarf male or remain immature and grow. Large individuals
   allocate reproductive resources between male and female functions. The
   fraction c of newly settled individuals who remain immature and the sex
   allocation of large individuals m are quantities to evolve. In the
   stationary ESS, if the relative reproductive success of dwarf males is
   greater than the survivorship of immature individuals until they reach a
   mature size, then the population is a mixture of females and dwarf
   males. If the opposite inequality holds, the population is dominated by
   hermaphrodites and lacks dwarf males. There is no case in which a
   mixture of hermaphrodites and dwarf males to be the ESS in the
   stationary solution. The ESS can be solved by dynamic programming when
   the strategies depend on the age of the microhabitat (c (t) and m (t)).
   Typically, the ESS schedule begins with a population composed only of
   hermaphrodites, which is replaced by a mixture of dwarf males and
   hermaphrodites and then by a mixture of dwarf males and pure females.
   The relative importance of these three phases depends on multiple
   parameters. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {The mutation process on the ancestral line under selection},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {158},
Pages = {60-75},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {We consider the Moran model of population genetics with two types,
   mutation, and selection, and investigate the line of descent of a
   randomly -sampled individual from a contemporary population. We trace
   this ancestral line back into the distant past, far beyond the most
   recent common ancestor of the population (thus connecting population
   genetics to phylogeny), and analyse the mutation process along this
   line. To this end, we use the pruned lookdown ancestral selection graph
   (Lenz et al., 2015), which consists of a set of potential ancestors of
   the sampled individual at any given time. Relative to the neutral case
   (that is, without selection), we obtain a general bias towards the
   beneficial type, an increase in the beneficial mutation rate, and a
   decrease in the deleterious mutation rate. This sheds new light on
   previous analytical results. We discuss our findings in the light of a
   well-known observation at the interface of phylogeny and population
   genetics, namely, the difference in the mutation rates (or, more
   precisely, mutation fluxes) estimated via phylogenetic methods relative
   to those observed in pedigree studies.},

Title = {A time-since-infection model for populations with two pathogens},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {144},
Pages = {1-12},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The pioneering work of Kermack and McKendrick (1927, 1932, 1933) is now
   most known for introducing the SIR model, which divides a population
   into discrete compartments for susceptible, infected and removed
   individuals. The SIR model is the archetype of widely used compartmental
   models for epidemics. It is sometimes forgotten, that Kermack and
   McKendrick introduced the SIR model as a special case of a more general
   framework. This general framework distinguishes individuals not only by
   whether they are susceptible, infected or removed, but additionally
   tracks the time passed since they got infected. Such
   time-since-infection models can mechanistically link within-host
   dynamics to the population level. This allows the models to account for
   more details of the disease dynamics, such as delays of infectiousness
   and symptoms during the onset of an infection. Details like this can be
   vital for interpreting epidemiological data.
   The time-since-infection framework was originally formulated for a host
   population with a single pathogen. However, the interactions of multiple
   pathogens within hosts and within a population can be crucial for
   understanding the severity and spread of diseases. Current models for
   multiple pathogens mostly rely on compartmental models. While such
   models are relatively easy to set up, they do not have the same
   mechanistic underpinning as time-since-infection models. To approach
   this gap of connecting within-host dynamics of multiple pathogens to the
   population level, we here extend the time-since-infection framework of
   Kermack and McKendrick for two pathogens.
   We derive formulas for the basic reproduction numbers in the system.
   Those numbers determine whether a pathogen can invade a population,
   potentially depending on whether the other pathogen is present or not.
   We then demonstrate use of the framework by setting up a simple
   within-host model that we connect to the population model. The example
   illustrates the context-specific information required for this type of
   model, and shows how the system can be simulated numerically. We verify
   that the formulas for the basic reproduction numbers correctly specify
   the invasibility conditions. (c) 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Title = {A two-sex renewal model and its population projection},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {143},
Pages = {46-51},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Population projections rely on one-sex renewal models. Consequently,
   changing the projection of male mortality does not affect the projection
   of birth, contradicting commonsense. A two-sex renewal model is
   presented in this paper to provide a better description of reproduction
   and more reasonable population projections. This model is nonlinear and
   includes the one-sex renewal models as special cases. In this model,
   age-specific birth rates are defined for two sexes jointly; total
   fertility, net reproduction rate, and intrinsic growth rate are also
   derived for two sexes jointly; and age-specific populations approach or
   converge to stable status. Applying the two-sex renewal model to
   Australia, it indicates that one-sex models underestimated the intrinsic
   growth rate by 14 percent. Compared to the results of one-sex models,
   the two-sex model would provide higher growth rate for low-fertility
   countries, and lower growth rate for high-fertility countries. In other
   words, the one-sex models are commonly biased. If the two-sex model is
   applied to all the countries, it would project smaller populations for
   the world in the future. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Mate guarding in primates arises due to partner scarcity, even if the
   father provides no paternal care at all},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {142},
Pages = {100-113},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Paternal care is unusual among primates; in most species males compete
   with one another for the acquisition of mates and leave the raising of
   offspring to the mothers. Callitrichids defy this trend with both
   fathers and older siblings contributing to the care of offspring. We
   extend a two-strategy population model (paternal care versus male-male
   competition) to account for various mechanisms that could possibly
   explain why male callitrichids invest in paternal care over male-male
   competition, and compare results from callitrichid, chimpanzee and
   hunter-gatherer life history parameters. The survival benefit to
   offspring due to care is an insufficient explanation of callitrichid
   paternal care, and the additional inclusion of differences in
   lactation-related biology similarly do not change that picture. Instead,
   paternal care may arise in parallel with, or even as a result of, mate
   guarding, which in turn is only beneficial when partners are scarce as
   modelled by the birth sex ratio in callitrichids and menopause in
   hunter-gatherers. In that situation, care need not even provide any
   benefit to the young (in the form of a survival bonus) for guarding to
   out-compete multiple mating competition. Crown Copyright (C) 2021

   explain a long-standing observation concerning the dynamics of linkage

Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},

Volume = {127},
Pages = {75-90},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Understanding tick-transmitted pathogens in tick infested areas is
   crucial for the development of preventive and control measures in
   response to the increasing cases of tick-borne diseases. A stochastic
   model for the dynamics of two pathogens, Rickettsia parkeri and
   Rickettsia amblyommii, in a single tick, Amblyomma americanum, is
   developed and analysed. The model, a continuous-time Markov chain, is
   based on a deterministic tick-borne disease model. The extinction
   threshold for the stochastic model is computed using the multitype
   branching process and conditions for pathogen extinction or persistence
   are presented. The probability of pathogen extinction is computed using
   numerical simulations and is shown to be a good estimate of the
   probability of extinction calculated from the branching process. A
   sensitivity analysis is undertaken to illustrate the relationship
   between co-feeding and transovarial transmission rates and the
   probability of pathogen extinction. Expected epidemic duration is
   estimated using sample paths and we show that R. amblyommii is likely to
   persist slightly longer than R. parkeri. Further, we estimate the
   duration of possible coexistence of the two pathogens. (C) 2019 Elsevier

Title = {Modelling the outbreak of infectious disease following mutation from a
   non-transmissible strain},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {126},
Pages = {1-18},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {In-host mutation of a cross-species infectious disease to a form that is
   transmissible between humans has resulted with devastating global
   pandemics in the past. We use simple mathematical models to describe
   this process with the aim to better understand the emergence of an
   epidemic resulting from such a mutation and the extent of measures that
   are needed to control it. The feared outbreak of a human-human
   transmissible form of avian influenza leading to a global epidemic is
   the paradigm for this study. We extend the SIR approach to derive a
   deterministic and a stochastic formulation to describe the evolution of
   two classes of susceptible and infected states and a removed state,
   leading to a system of ordinary differential equations and a stochastic
   equivalent based on a Markov process. For the deterministic model, the
   contrasting timescale of the mutation process and disease infectiousness
   is exploited in two limits using asymptotic analysis in order to
   determine, in terms of the model parameters, necessary conditions for an
   epidemic to take place and timescales for the onset of the epidemic, the
   size and duration of the epidemic and the maximum level of the infected
   individuals at one time. Furthermore, the basic reproduction number R-0
   is determined from asymptotic analysis of a distinguished limit.
   Comparisons between the deterministic and stochastic model demonstrate
   that stochasticity has little effect on most aspects of an epidemic, but
   does have significant impact on its onset particularly for smaller
   populations and lower mutation rates for representatively large
   populations. The deterministic model is extended to investigate a range
   of quarantine and vaccination programmes, whereby in the two asymptotic
   limits analysed, quantitative estimates on the outcomes and
   effectiveness of these control measures are established. (C) 2018

Abstract = {The stationary distribution of the diffusion limit of the 2-island,

   and Tang (2016, 2017) for approximating the forward Kolmogorov equation,
   the stationary distribution is obtained to leading order as a set of
   line densities on the edges of the sample space, corresponding to states
   for which one island is bi-allelic and the other island is
   non-segregating, and a set of point masses at the corners of the sample
   space, corresponding to states for which both islands are simultaneously
   non-segregating. Analytic results for the corner probabilities and line
   densities are verified independently using the backward generator and
   for the corner probabilities using the coalescent. (C) 2018 Elsevier

Title = {Disentangling eco-evolutionary effects on trait fixation},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {124},
Pages = {93-107},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In population genetics, fixation of traits in a demographically changing
   population under frequency-independent selection has been extensively
   analysed. In evolutionary game theory, models of fixation have typically
   focused on fixed population sizes and frequency-dependent selection. A
   combination of demographic fluctuations with frequency-dependent
   interactions such as Lotka-Volterra dynamics has received comparatively
   little attention. We consider a stochastic, competitive Lotka-Volterra
   model with higher order interactions between two traits. The emerging
   individual-based model allows for stochastic fluctuations in the
   frequencies of the two traits and the total population size. We
   calculate the fixation probability of a trait under differing
   competition coefficients. This fixation probability resembles,
   qualitatively, the deterministic evolutionary dynamics. Furthermore, we
   partially disentangle the selection effects into their ecological and
   evolutionary components. We find that changing the evolutionary
   selection strength also changes the population dynamics and vice versa.
   Thus, a clean separation of the ecological and evolutionary effects is
   not possible. Instead, our results imply a nested interaction of the
   evolutionary and ecological effects. The entangled eco-evolutionary
   processes thus cannot be ignored when determining fixation properties in
   a co-evolutionary system. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},

Volume = {121},
Pages = {1-11},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {In this study, I explored the impact of constructing a new dispersal
   route between two different patches in a metapopulation. My results
   indicated that its success failure on the population abundance greatly
   depends on the patches directly involved and negligibly on the network
   topology. Specifically, constructing a dispersal route is highly
   recommended if it connects a source to a source that is close to
   becoming a sink or a sink that is close to becoming a source. This
   biological property is the basis for understanding the influence of the
   network topology on the population abundance. According to some
   thresholds discussed in this manuscript, I identified when a given route
   has a positive or negative effect on the population size. Consequently,
   as a simple rule of thumb, managers should look for metapopulations that
   have the maximum (resp. minimum) number paths with a positive (resp.
   negative) effect on the population abundance. As emphasized, the
   biological results of this paper do not depend on the model formulation.

Title = {Non-random mating and information theory},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {120},
Pages = {103-113},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {In this work, mate choice is modeled by means of the abstract concept of
   mutual mating propensity. This only assumes that different types of
   couples can have different mating success. The model is adequate for any
   population where mating occurs among distinct types. There is no extra
   assumption about particular mating scheme or preference model. The
   concept of mutual mating propensity permits to express the observed
   change in the mating phenotypes as the gain in information with respect
   to random mating. The obtained expression is a form of the Price
   equation in which the mapping between ancestral and descendant
   population is substituted by a mapping between random mating and non
   random mating population.
   At the same time, this framework provides the connection between mate
   choice and the exact mathematical partition of the choice effects,
   namely sexual isolation, sexual selection and a mixed effect. The sexual
   selection component is the sum of the intra-sexual male and female
   selection.
   The proposed framework helps to unveil previously hidden invariants. For
   example, if the mutual preference between partner types is
   multiplicative there is no sexual isolation (inter-sexual selection)
   effect on the frequencies, i.e. the only possible effect of mate choice
   is intra-sexual selection. On the contrary, whatever the contribution of
   each partner to the mutual preference, if it comes as a non
   multiplicative factor, there is at least an inter-sexual selection
   detectable effect.
   This new view over the mate choice problem, permits to develop general
   mating propensity models and to make predictions of the mate choice
   effects that may emerge from such models. This possibility opens up the
   way for setting a general theory of model fitting and multimodel
   inference for mate choice.
   Thus, it is suggested that the proposed framework, by describing mate
   choice as the flow of information due to non-random mating, provides a
   new important setting for exploring different mating models and their
   consequences. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

   This commentary distinguishes three nested approximations, referred to
   as ``infinitesimal genetics,{''} ``Gaussian descendants{''} and
   ``Gaussian population,{''} each plausibly called ``the infinitesimal
   model.{''} The first and most basic is Fisher's ``infinitesimal{''}
   approximation of the underlying genetics-namely, many loci, each making
   a small contribution to the total variance. As Barton et al. (2017)
   show, in the limit as the number of loci increases (with enough
   additivity), the distribution of genotypic values for descendants
   approaches a multivariate Gaussian, whose variance-covariance structure
   depends only on the relatedness, not the phenotypes, of the parents (or
   whether their population experiences selection or other processes such
   as mutation and migration). Barton et al. (2017) call this rigorously
   defensible ``Gaussian descendants{''} approximation ``the infinitesimal
   model.{''} However, it is widely assumed that Fisher's genetic
   assumptions yield another Gaussian approximation, in which the
   distribution of breeding values in a population follows a Gaussian even
   if the population is subject to non-Gaussian selection. This third
   ``Gaussian population{''} approximation, is also described as the
   ``infinitesimal model.{''} Unlike the ``Gaussian descendants{''}
   approximation, this third approximation cannot be rigorously justified,
   except in a weak-selection limit, even for a purely additive model.
   Nevertheless, it underlies the two most widely used descriptions of
   selection-induced changes in trait means and genetic variances, the
   ``breeder's equation{''} and the ``Bulmer effect.{''} Future generations
   may understand why the ``infinitesimal model{''} provides such useful
   approximations in the face of epistasis, linkage, linkage disequilibrium
   and strong selection. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Ideal free distribution of metabolic activity: Implications of seasonal
   metabolic-activity patterns on competitive coexistence},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {111},
Pages = {1-8},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The seasonal distribution of metabolic activity determines how much
   individuals experience different aspects of a periodically changing
   environment. Seasonal metabolic-activity patterns of coexisting species
   may differ significantly despite their shared environmental conditions,
   suggesting that interspecific diversification of this trait has a major
   role in the coexistence of competing species. In the present study the
   effect of the seasonal distribution of metabolic activity on intra- and
   interspecific competition is investigated in a consumer-resource model.
   It is shown that, in a periodically changing environment, for each
   environmental preference pattern there is an ideal seasonal distribution
   of metabolic activity, which results in maximum resource utilisation
   efficiency and competitive superiority. Contrary to the common:
   interpretation of temporal niche segregation, opposing species-specific
   seasonal preferences are not a sufficient condition for the coexistence
   of two species on a population dynamical time scale. A necessary and
   sufficient condition for coexistence is the temporal segregation of the
   species via different seasonal activity distributions. However,
   coexistence is evolutionarily stable only if seasonal metabolic
   activities and preferences are positively correlated. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Title = {The site-frequency spectrum associated with Ξ-coalescents},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {110},
Pages = {36-50},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {We give recursions for the expected site-frequency spectrum associated
   with so-called Xi-coalescents, that is exchangeable coalescents which
   admit simultaneous multiple mergers of ancestral lineages.
   Xi-coalescents arise, for example, in association with population models
   of skewed offspring distributions with diploidy, recurrent advantageous
   mutations, or strong bottlenecks. In contrast, the simpler
   Lambda-coalescents admit multiple mergers of lineages, but at most one
   such merger each time. Xi-coalescents, as well as Lambda-coalescents,
   can predict an excess of singletons, compared to the Kingman coalescent.
   We compare estimates of coalescent parameters when Xi-coalescents are
   applied to data generated by Lambda-coalescents, and vice versa. In
   general, Xi-coalescents predict fewer singletons than corresponding
   Lambda-coalescents, but a higher count of mutations of size larger than
   singletons. We fit examples of Xi-coalescents to unfolded site-frequency
   spectra obtained for autosomal loci of the diploid Atlantic cod, and
   obtain different coalescent parameter estimates than obtained with
   corresponding Lambda-coalescents. Our results provide new inference
   tools, and suggest that for autosomal population genetic data from
   diploid or polyploid highly fecund populations who may have skewed
   offspring distributions, one should not apply Lambda-coalescents, but
   Xi-coalescents. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Consistency and inconsistency of consensus methods for inferring species
   trees from gene trees in the presence of ancestral population structure},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {110},
Pages = {12-24},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {In the last few years, several statistically consistent consensus
   methods for species tree inference have been devised that are robust to
   the gene tree discordance caused by incomplete lineage sorting in
   unstructured ancestral populations. One source of gene tree discordance
   that has only recently been identified as a potential obstacle for
   phylogenetic inference is ancestral population structure. In this
   article, we describe a general model of ancestral population structure,
   and by relying on a single carefully constructed example scenario, we
   show that the consensus methods Democratic Vote, STEAC, STAR, R{*}
   Consensus, Rooted Triple Consensus, Minimize Deep Coalescences, and
   Majority-Rule Consensus are statistically inconsistent under the model.
   We find that among the consensus methods evaluated, the only method that
   is statistically consistent in the presence of ancestral population
   structure is GLASS/Maximum Tree. We use simulations to evaluate the
   behavior of the various consensus methods in a model with ancestral
   population structure, showing that as the number of gene trees
   increases, estimates on the basis of GLASS/Maximum Tree approach the
   true species tree topology irrespective of the level of population
   structure, whereas estimates based on the remaining methods only
   approach the true species tree topology if the level of structure is
   low. However, through simulations using species trees both with and
   without ancestral population structure, we show that GLASS/Maximum Tree
   performs unusually poorly on gene trees inferred from alignments with
   little information. This practical limitation of GLASS/Maximum Tree
   together with the inconsistency of other methods prompts the need for
   both further testing of additional existing methods and development of
   novel methods under conditions that incorporate ancestral population
   structure. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Pedigrees or markers: Which are better in estimating relatedness and
   inbreeding coefficient?},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {107},
Number = {SI},
Pages = {4-13},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Individual inbreeding coefficient (F) and pairwise relatedness (r) are
   fundamental parameters in population genetics and have important
   applications in diverse fields such as human medicine, forensics, plant
   and animal breeding, conservation and evolutionary biology.
   Traditionally, both parameters are calculated from pedigrees, but are
   now increasingly estimated from genetic marker data. Conceptually, a
   pedigree gives the expected F and r values, F-p and r(p), with the
   expectations being taken (hypothetically) over an infinite number of
   individuals with the same pedigree. In contrast, markers give the
   realised (actual) F and r values at the particular marker loci of the
   particular individuals, F-M and r(M). Both pedigree (F-p, r(p)) and
   marker (F-M, r(M)) estimates can be used as inferences of genomic
   inbreeding coefficients F-G and genomic relatedness r(G), which are the
   underlying quantities relevant to most applications (such as estimating
   inbreeding depression and heritability) of F and r. In the pre-genomic
   era, it was widely accepted that pedigrees are much better than markers
   in delineating F-G and r(G), and markers should better be used to
   validate, amend and construct pedigrees rather than to replace them. Is
   this still true in the genomic era when genome-wide dense SNPs are
   available? In this simulation study, I showed that genomic markers can
   yield much better estimates of F-G and r(G) than pedigrees when they are
   numerous (say, 10(4) SNPs) under realistic situations (e.g. genome and
   population sizes). Pedigree estimates are especially poor for species
   with a small genome, where F-G and r(G) are determined to a large extent
   by Mendelian segregations and may thus deviate substantially from their
   expectations (F-p and r(p)). Simulations also confirmed that F-M, when
   estimated from many SNPs, can be much more powerful than F-p for
   detecting inbreeding depression in viability. However, I argue that
   pedigrees cannot be replaced completely by genomic SNPs, because the
   former allows for the calculation of more complicated IBD coefficients
   (involving more than 2 individuals, more than one locus, and more than 2
   genes at a locus) for which the latter may have reduced capacity or
   limited power, and because the former has social and other significance
   for remote relationships which have little genetic significance and
   cannot be inferred reliably from markers. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All

Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2015},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Recent positive selection can increase the frequency of an advantageous
   mutant rapidly enough that a relatively long ancestral haplotype will be
   remained intact around it. We present a hidden Markov model (HMM) to
   identify such haplotype structures. With HMM identified haplotype
   structures, a population genetic model for the extent of ancestral
   haplotypes is then adopted for parameter inference of the selection
   intensity and the allele age. Simulations show that this method can
   detect selection under a wide range of conditions and has higher power
   than the existing frequency spectrum-based method. In addition, it
   provides good estimate of the selection coefficients and allele ages for
   strong selection. The method analyzes large data sets in a reasonable
   amount of running time. This method is applied to HapMap III data for a
   genome scan, and identifies a list of candidate regions putatively under
   recent positive selection. It is also applied to several genes known to
   be under recent positive selection, including the LCT, KITLG and TYRP1
   genes in Northern Europeans, and OCA2 in East Asians, to estimate their
   allele ages and selection coefficients. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All

Title = {A general condition for adaptive genetic polymorphism in temporally and
   spatially heterogeneous environments},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {99},
Pages = {76-97},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Both evolution and ecology have long been concerned with the impact of
   variable environmental conditions on observed levels of genetic
   diversity within and between species. We model the evolution of a
   quantitative trait under selection that fluctuates in space and time,
   and derive an analytical condition for when these fluctuations promote
   genetic diversification. As ecological scenario we use a generalized
   island model with soft selection within patches in which we incorporate
   generation overlap. We allow for arbitrary fluctuations in the
   environment including spatio-temporal correlations and any functional
   form of selection on the trait. Using the concepts of invasion fitness
   and evolutionary branching, we derive a simple and transparent condition
   for the adaptive evolution and maintenance of genetic diversity. This
   condition relates the strength of selection within patches to
   expectations and variances in the environmental conditions across space
   and time. Our results unify, clarify, and extend a number of previous
   results on the evolution and maintenance of genetic variation under
   fluctuating selection. Individual-based simulations show that our
   results are independent of the details of the genetic architecture and
   whether reproduction is clonal or sexual. The onset of increased genetic
   variance is predicted accurately also in small populations in which
   alleles can go extinct due to environmental stochasticity. (C) 2014

Title = {Frequency-dependent population dynamics: Effect of sex ratio and mating
   system on the elasticity of population growth rate},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {97},
Pages = {49-56},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {When vital rates depend on population structure (e.g., relative
   frequencies of males or females), an important question is how the
   long-term population growth rate lambda responds to changes in rates.
   For instance, availability of mates may depend on the sex ratio of the
   population and hence reproductive rates could be frequency-dependent. In
   such cases change in any vital rate alters the structure, which in turn,
   affect frequency-dependent rates. We show that the elasticity of lambda
   to a rate is the sum of (i) the effect of the linear change in the rate
   and (ii) the effect of nonlinear changes in frequency-dependent rates.
   The first component is always positive and is the classical elasticity
   in density-independent models obtained directly from the population
   projection matrix. The second component can be positive or negative and
   is absent in density-independent models. We explicitly express each
   component of the elasticity as a function of vital rates, eigenvalues
   and eigenvectors of the population projection matrix. We apply this
   result to a two-sex model, where male and female fertilities depend on
   adult sex ratio alpha (ratio of females to males) and the mating system
   (e.g., polygyny) through a harmonic mating function. We show that the
   nonlinear component of elasticity to a survival rate is negligible only
   when the average number of mates (per male) is close to alpha. In a
   strictly monogamous species, elasticity to female survival is larger
   than elasticity to male survival when alpha < 1 (less females). In a
   polygynous species, elasticity to female survival can be larger than
   that of male survival even when sex ratio is female biased. Our results
   show how demography and mating system together determine the response to
   selection on sex-specific vital rates. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {Fixation probability of mobile genetic elements such as plasmids{*}},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {90},
Pages = {49-55},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Mobile genetic elements such as plasmids are increasingly becoming
   thought of as evolutionarily important. Being horizontally transmissible
   is generally assumed to be beneficial for a gene. Using several simple
   modelling approaches we show that in fact being horizontally
   transferable is just as important for fixation as being beneficial to
   the host, in line with other results. We find fixation probability is
   approximately 2(s + beta), where s is the increased (vertical) fitness
   provided by the gene, and beta the rate of horizontal transfer when
   rare. This result comes about because when the gene is rare, almost all
   individuals in the population are possible recipients of horizontal
   transfer. The ability to horizontally transfer could thus cause a
   deleterious gene to become fixed in a population even without
   hitchhiking. Our findings provide further evidence for the importance
   and ubiquity of mobile genetic elements, particularly in microorganisms.

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {This paper introduces a simple greedy algorithm for searching for high
   likelihood pedigrees using microsatellite (STR) genotype information on
   a complete sample of related individuals. The core idea behind the
   algorithm is not new, but it is believed that putting it into a greedy
   search setting, and specifically the application to pedigree learning,
   is novel. The algorithm does not require age or sex information, but
   this information can be incorporated if desired. The algorithm is
   applied to human and non-human genetic data and in a simulation study.

Title = {Metapopulation dynamics on the brink of extinction},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {83},
Pages = {101-122},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {We analyse metapopulation dynamics in terms of an individual-based,
   stochastic model of a finite metapopulation. We suggest a new approach,
   using the number of patches in the population as a large parameter. This
   approach does not require that the number of individuals per patch is
   large, neither is it necessary to assume a time-scale separation between
   local population dynamics and migration. Our approach makes it possible
   to accurately describe the dynamics of metapopulations consisting of
   many small patches. We focus on metapopulations on the brink of
   extinction. We estimate the time to extinction and describe the most
   likely path to extinction. We find that the logarithm of the time to
   extinction is proportional to the product of two vectors, a vector
   characterising the distribution of patch population sizes in the
   quasi-steady state, and a vector related to Fisher's reproduction vector
   that quantifies the sensitivity of the quasi-steady state distribution
   to demographic fluctuations. We compare our analytical results to
   stochastic simulations of the model, and discuss the range of validity
   of the analytical expressions. By identifying fast and slow degrees of
   freedom in the metapopulation dynamics, we show that the dynamics of
   large metapopulations close to extinction is approximately described by
   a deterministic equation originally proposed by Levins (1969). We were
   able to compute the rates in Levins' equation in terms of the parameters
   of our stochastic, individual-based model. It turns out, however, that
   the interpretation of the dynamical variable depends strongly on the
   intrinsic growth rate and carrying capacity of the patches. Only when
   the local growth rate and the carrying capacity are large does the slow
   variable correspond to the number of patches, as envisaged by Levins.
   Last but not least, we discuss how our findings relate to other, widely
   used metapopulation models. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Sharp habitat shifts, evolutionary tipping points and rescue:
   Quantifying the perilous path of a specialist species towards a refugium
   in a changing environment},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {160},
Pages = {25-48},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Specialist species thriving under specific environmental conditions in
   narrow geographic ranges are widely recognized as heavily threatened by
   climate deregulation. Many might rely on both their potential to adapt
   and to disperse towards a refugium to avoid extinction. It is thus
   crucial to understand the influence of environmental conditions on the
   unfolding process of adaptation. Here, I study the eco-evolutionary
   dynamics of a sexually reproducing specialist species in a two-patch
   quantitative genetic model with moving optima. Thanks to a separation of
   ecological and evolutionary time scales and the phase-line study of the
   selection gradient, I derive the critical environmental speed for
   persistence, which reflects how the existence of a refugium impacts
   extinction patterns and how it relates to the cost of dispersal.
   Moreover, the analysis provides key insights about the dynamics that
   arise on the path towards this refugium. I show that after an initial
   increase of population size, there exists a critical environmental speed
   above which the species crosses a tipping point, resulting into an
   abrupt habitat switch. In addition, when selection for local adaptation
   is strong, this habitat switch passes through an evolutionary ``death
   valley{''}, leading to a phenomenon related to evolutionary rescue,
   which can promote extinction for lower environmental speeds than the
   critical one.},

Title = {Mean-field interacting multi-type birth-death processes with a view to
   applications in phylodynamics},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {159},
Pages = {1-12},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Multi-type birth-death processes underlie approaches for inferring
   evolutionary dynamics from phylogenetic trees across biological scales,
   ranging from deep-time species macroevolution to rapid viral evolution
   and somatic cellular proliferation. A limitation of current phylogenetic
   birth-death models is that they require restrictive linearity
   assumptions that yield tractable message-passing likelihoods, but that
   also preclude interactions between individuals. Many fundamental
   evolutionary processes - such as environmental carrying capacity or
   frequency-dependent selection - entail interactions, and may strongly
   influence the dynamics in some systems. Here, we introduce a multi-type
   birth-death process in mean-field interaction with an ensemble of
   replicas of the focal process. We prove that, under quite general
   conditions, the ensemble's stochastically evolving interaction field
   converges to a deterministic trajectory in the limit of an infinite
   ensemble. In this limit, the replicas effectively decouple, and
   self-consistent interactions appear as nonlinearities in the
   infinitesimal generator of the focal process. We investigate a special
   case that is rich enough to model both carrying capacity and
   frequency-dependent selection while yielding tractable message-passing
   likelihoods in the context of a phylogenetic birth-death model.},

Title = {The structured coalescent in the context of gene copy number variation},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {154},
Pages = {67-78},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The Structured Coalescent was introduced to describe the coalescent
   process in spatially subdivided populations with migration. Here, we
   re-interpret migration routes of individuals in the original model as
   ``migration routes{''}of single genes in tandemly arranged gene arrays.
   A gene copy may change its position within the array via unequal
   recombination. Hence, in a coalescent framework, two copies sampled from
   two chromosomes may coalesce only if they are at exactly homologous
   positions. Otherwise, one or multiple recombination events have to occur
   before they can coalesce, thereby increasing mean coalescence time and
   expected genetic diversity among the copies in a gene array. We
   explicitly calculate the transition probabilities on these routes
   backward in time. We simulate the structured coalescent with migration
   and coalescence rates informed by the unequal recombination process of
   gene copies. With this novel interpretation of population structure
   models we determine coalescence times and expected genetic diversity in
   samples of orthologous and paralogous copies from a gene family. As a
   case study, we discuss the site frequency spectrum of a small gene
   family in the two scenarios of high and of no gene copy number variation
   among individuals. These examples underline the significance of our
   model, since standard test-statistics may lead to misinterpretations
   when analyzing sequence data of multi-copy genes due to their different
   expected genetic diversity. (c) 2023 The Author(s). Published by

Title = {Evolutionarily stable levels of aposematic defence in prey populations},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {153},
Pages = {15-36},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Our understanding of aposematism (the conspicuous signalling of a
   defence for the deterrence of predators) has advanced notably since its
   first observation in the late nineteenth century. Indeed, it extends the
   scope of a well-established game-theoretical model of this very same
   process both from the analytical standpoint (by considering regimes of
   varying background mortality and colony size) and from the practical
   standpoint (by assessing its efficacy and limitations in predicting the
   evolution of prey traits in finite simulated populations). The nature of
   the manuscript at hand is more mathematical and its aim is two-fold:
   first, to determine the relationship between evolutionarily stable
   levels of defence and signal strength under various regimes of
   background mortality and colony size. Second, to compare these
   predictions with simulations of finite prey populations that are subject
   to random local mutation. We compare the roles of absolute resident
   fitness, mutant fitness and stochasticity in the evolution of prey
   traits and discuss the importance of population size in the above.Crown

Title = {A cultural evolutionary model of the interaction between parental
   beliefs and behaviors, with applications to vaccine hesitancy},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {152},
Pages = {23-38},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Health perceptions and health-related behaviors can change at the
   population level as cultures evolve. In the last decade, despite the
   proven efficacy of vaccines, the developed world has seen a resurgence
   of vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs) such as measles, pertussis, and
   polio. Vaccine hesitancy, which is influenced by historical, political,
   and socio-cultural forces, is believed to be a primary factor
   responsible for decreasing vaccine coverage, thereby increasing the risk
   and occurrence of VPD outbreaks. Behavior change models have been
   increasingly employed to understand disease dynamics and intervention
   effectiveness. However, since health behaviors are culturally
   influenced, it is valuable to examine them within a cultural evolution
   context. Here, using a mathematical modeling framework, we explore the
   effects of cultural evolution on vaccine hesitancy and vaccination
   behavior. With this model, we shed light on facets of cultural evolution
   (vertical transmission, community influences, homophily, etc.) that
   promote the spread of vaccine hesitancy, ultimately affecting levels of
   vaccination coverage and VPD outbreak risk in a population. In addition,
   we present our model as a generalizable framework for exploring cultural
   evolution when humans' beliefs influence, but do not strictly dictate,
   their behaviors. This model offers a means of exploring how parents'
   potentially conflicting beliefs and cultural traits could affect their
   children's health and fitness. We show that vaccine confidence and
   vaccine-conferred benefits can both be driving forces of vaccine
   coverage. We also demonstrate that an assortative preference among
   vaccine-hesitant individuals can lead to increased vaccine hesitancy and
   lower vaccine coverage.\& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {A population genetics theory for piRNA-regulated transposable elements},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {150},
Pages = {1-13},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Transposable elements (TEs) are self-reproducing selfish DNA sequences
   that can invade the genome of virtually all living species. Population
   genetics models have shown that TE copy numbers generally reach a limit,
   either because the transposition rate decreases with the number of
   copies (transposition regulation) or because TE copies are deleterious,
   and thus purged by natural selection. Yet, recent empirical discoveries
   suggest that TE regulation may mostly rely on piRNAs, which require a
   specific mutational event (the insertion of a TE copy in a piRNA
   cluster) to be activated - the so-called TE regulation ``trap model{''}.
   We derived new population genetics models accounting for this trap
   mechanism, and showed that the resulting equilibria differ substantially
   from previous expectations based on a transposition-selection
   equilibrium. We proposed three sub-models, depending on whether or not
   genomic TE copies and piRNA cluster TE copies are selectively neutral or
   deleterious, and we provide analytical expressions for maximum and
   equilibrium copy numbers, as well as cluster frequencies for all of
   them. In the full neutral model, the equilibrium is achieved when
   transposition is completely silenced, and this equilibrium does not
   depend on the transposition rate. When genomic TE copies are deleterious
   but not cluster TE copies, no long-term equilibrium is possible, and
   active TEs are eventually eliminated after an active incomplete invasion
   stage. When all TE copies are deleterious, a transposition-selection
   equilibrium exists, but the invasion dynamics is not monotonic, and the
   copy number peaks before decreasing. Mathematical predictions were in
   good agreement with numerical simulations, except when genetic drift
   and/or linkage disequilibrium dominates. Overall, the trap -model
   dynamics appeared to be substantially more stochastic and less
   repeatable than traditional regulation models. (c) 2023 Elsevier Inc.

Title = {First-order effect of frequency-dependent selection on fixation
   probability in an age-structured population with application to a public
   goods game},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {133},
Pages = {80-96},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In this paper, we deduce the first-order effect of frequency-dependent
   viability and fertility selection on the probability of fixation of a
   mutant in a large finite haploid population with a fixed age structure
   by applying a direct small perturbation method to the neutral
   two-timescale genealogical process. This effect is expressed in terms of
   fixation-fitness coefficients times ancestry coefficients that are
   related to the effective population size. In the case of constant
   selection, the fixation-fitness coefficients are functions of the
   coefficients of viability and fertility selection weighted by
   reproductive values and population-structure coefficients for the
   different age classes. This explains the difference between the effects
   of viability selection and fertility selection on fixation probability
   in age-structured populations. With frequency-dependent selection in the
   form of a public goods game, the fixation-fitness coefficients depend
   also on the public good allocation strategy of the population and the
   resource allocation strategies of the individuals. In this case, the
   results show that weak selection may favor the fixation of cooperation
   if the cooperators allocate more resources to reproduction versus
   survival than the defectors do. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {Dispersal asymmetry in a two-patch system with source-sink populations},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {131},
Pages = {54-65},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {This paper analyzes source-sink systems with asymmetric dispersal
   between two patches. Complete analysis on the models demonstrates a
   mechanism by which the dispersal asymmetry can lead to either an
   increased total size of the species population in two patches, a
   decreased total size with persistence in the patches, or even extinction
   in both patches. For a large growth rate of the species in the source
   and a fixed dispersal intensity, (i) if the asymmetry is small, the
   population would persist in both patches and reach a density higher than
   that without dispersal, in which the population approaches its maximal
   density at an appropriate asymmetry; (ii) if the asymmetry is
   intermediate, the population persists in both patches but reaches a
   density less than that without dispersal; (iii) if the asymmetry is
   large, the population goes to extinction in both patches; (iv)
   asymmetric dispersal is more favorable than symmetric dispersal under
   certain conditions. For a fixed asymmetry, similar phenomena occur when
   the dispersal intensity varies, while a thorough analysis is given for
   the low growth rate of the species in the source. Implications for
   populations in heterogeneous landscapes are discussed, and numerical
   simulations confirm and extend our results. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All

   reproductive success, whereas parents in bad condition favour the
   opposite sex. Theorists distinguish two variants of the TWH: (a) a
   biased sex-ratio at birth and (b) biased parental investment after
   birth. It has been argued before that the conditions stated by Trivers
   and Willard (good condition is inherited and affects reproductive
   success more strongly for one of the sexes) are sufficient for the
   sex-ratio version but insufficient for the investment version of the MM.
   However, it has not yet been investigated how these conditions affect
   parental investment in high and low quality parents, depending on the
   life-cycle of a species.
   The present study aims to fill this gap by introducing a multi-stage
   matrix population model with nonlinear mating to describe the effects of
   parental investment after birth on the reproductive values of male and
   female individuals. Using methods from adaptive dynamics and
   evolutionary invasion analysis, evolutionary trajectories and
   evolutionarily stable strategies are derived for different
   parameterizations of the model.
   Simulation results demonstrate that the conditions given by Trivers and
   Willard produce a general bias of parental investment towards the sex
   with higher variance in reproductive value. This bias is stronger for
   low-quality parents than for high-quality parents and matches the
   expected marginal offspring reproductive values for parental investment.

Title = {Robust viability analysis of a controlled epidemiological model},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {126},
Pages = {51-58},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Managing infectious diseases is a world public health issue, plagued by
   uncertainties. In this paper, we analyze the problem of viable control
   of a dengue outbreak under uncertainty. For this purpose, we develop a
   controlled Ross-Macdonald model with mosquito vector control by
   fumigation, and with uncertainties affecting the dynamics; both controls
   and uncertainties are supposed to change only once a day, then remain
   stationary during the day. The robust viability kernel is the set of all
   initial states such that there exists at least a strategy of insecticide
   spraying which guarantees that the number of infected individuals
   remains below a threshold, for all times, and whatever the sequences of
   uncertainties. Having chosen three nested subsets of uncertainties - a
   deterministic one (without uncertainty), a medium one and a large one -
   we can measure the incidence of the uncertainties on the size of the
   kernel, in particular on its reduction with respect to the deterministic
   case. The numerical results show that the viability kernel without
   uncertainties is highly sensitive to the variability of parameters -
   here the biting rate, the probability of infection to mosquitoes and
   humans, and the proportion of female mosquitoes per person. So, a robust
   viability analysis is a possible tool to reveal the importance of
   uncertainties regarding epidemics control. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All

Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {125},
Pages = {11-19},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Evolutionary models for a cultural trait under vertical and oblique
   cultural transmission are analyzed. For a dichotomous trait, both the
   fitnesses of the variants and their rates of transmission are allowed to
   vary. In one class of models, transmission fluctuates cyclically
   together with fitnesses, and conditions are derived for a cultural
   polymorphism. A second class of models has transmission and selection
   fluctuating randomly with possible covariance between them. A third
   class of models involves two populations with migration between them and
   with transmission rates and fitnesses different in the two populations.
   Numerical analysis leads to qualitative conditions on the transmission
   rates and fitnesses that allow protected polymorphisms. With symmetric
   migration analytical conditions for protected polymorphism are derived.

Title = {Macroparasite dynamics of migratory host populations},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {120},
Pages = {29-41},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Spatial variability in host density is a key factor affecting disease
   dynamics of wildlife, and yet there are few spatially explicit models of
   host-macroparasite dynamics. This limits our understanding of parasitism
   in migratory hosts, whose densities change considerably in both space
   and time. In this paper, we develop a model for host-macroparasite
   dynamics that considers the directional movement of host populations and
   their associated parasites. We include spatiotemporal changes in the
   mean and variance in parasite burden per host, as well as
   parasite-mediated host mortality and parasite-mediated migratory
   ability. Reduced migratory ability with increasing parasitism results in
   heavily infested hosts halting their migration, and higher parasite
   burdens in stationary hosts than in moving hosts. Simulations reveal the
   potential for positive feedbacks between parasite-reduced migratory
   ability and increasing parasite burdens at infection hotspots, such as
   stopover sites, that may lead to parasite-induced migratory stalling.
   This framework could help understand how global change might influence
   wildlife disease via changes to migratory patterns and parasite
   demographic rates. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Revisiting the logistic map: A closer look at the dynamics of a classic
   chaotic population model with ecologically realistic spatial structure
   and dispersal},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {114},
Pages = {10-18},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {There is an ongoing debate about the applicability of chaotic and
   nonlinear models to ecological systems. Initial introduction of chaotic
   population models to the ecological literature was largely theoretical
   in nature and difficult to apply to real-world systems. Here, we build
   upon and expand prior work by performing an in-depth examination of the
   dynamical complexities of a spatially explicit chaotic population,
   within an ecologically applicable modeling framework. We pair a classic
   chaotic growth model (the logistic map)-with explicit dispersal length
   scale and shape via a Gaussian dispersal kernel. Spatio-temporal
   heterogeneity is incorporated by applying stochastic perturbations
   throughout the spatial domain. We witness a variety of population
   dynamics dependent on the growth rate, dispersal distance, and domain
   size. Dispersal serves to eliminate chaotic population behavior for many
   of the parameter combinations tested. The model displays extreme
   sensitivity to changes in growth rate, dispersal distance, or domain
   size, but is robust to low-level stochastic population perturbations.
   Large and temporally consistent perturbations can lead to a change in
   population dynamics. Frequent switching occurs between
   chaotic/non-chaotic behaviors as dispersal distance, domain size, or
   growth rate increases. Small changes in these parameters are easy to
   imagine in real populations, and understanding or anticipating the
   abrupt resulting shifts in population dynamics is important for
   population management and conservation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All

Title = {Recognizing the impact of endemic hepatitis D virus on hepatitis B virus
   eradication},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {112},
Pages = {60-69},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Background: Hepatitis delta virus (HDV) in conjunction with hepatitis B
   virus (HBV) increases adult morbidity and mortality. A number of studies
   have performed cost-benefit analyses for HBV interventions, but they
   have ignored the impact of HDV on these outcomes.
   Methods: Using a mathematical model of HBV-HDV epidemiology, we compare
   health benefits and cost outcomes of four interventions: testing with
   HBV adult vaccination (diagnosis), diagnosis with antiviral treatment
   for HBV infections (mono-infections), diagnosis with antiviral treatment
   for HBV-HDV infections (dual-infections), and awareness programs. The
   relationship between optimal levels and outcomes of each of these
   interventions and HDV prevalence in HBV infected individuals ranging
   from 0 to 50\% is determined.
   Results: Over a 50 year period under no intervention, HBV prevalence,
   per capita total cost and death toll increase by 2.25\%, -\$11 and
   2.6-fold respectively in moderate HDV endemic regions compared to
   mono-infected regions; the corresponding values for high HDV endemic
   regions are 4.2\%, -\$21 and 3.9-fold. Optimal interventions can be
   strategized similarly in mono and dually endemic regions. Only
   implementation of all four interventions achieves a very low HBV
   prevalence of around 1.5\% in a moderate HDV endemic region such as
   China, with 2.8 million fewer deaths compared to no intervention.
   Although the policy of implementation of all four interventions costs
   additional \$382 billion compared to no intervention, it still remains
   cost-effective with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of
   \$1400/QALY. Very high efficacy awareness programs achieve less
   prevalence with fewer deaths at a lower cost compared to treatment
   and/or vaccination programs.
   Conclusion: HDV substantially affects the performance of any HBV-related
   intervention. Its exclusion results in over-estimation of the
   effectiveness of HBV interventions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {Phenotypic evolution by distance in fluctuating environments: The
   contribution of dispersal, selection and random genetic drift},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {109},
Pages = {16-27},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Here we analyze how dispersal, genetic drift, and adaptation to the
   local environment affect the geographical differentiation of a
   quantitative character through natural selection using a spatial dynamic
   model for the evolution of the distribution of mean breeding values in
   space and time. The variation in optimal phenotype is described by local
   Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes with a given spatial autocorrelation.
   Selection and drift are assumed to be governed by phenotypic variation
   within areas with a given mean breeding value and constant additive
   genetic variance. Between such neighboring areas there will be white
   noise variation in mean breeding values, while the variation at larger
   distances has a spatial structure and a spatial scale that we
   investigate. The model is analyzed by solving balance equations for the
   stationary distribution of mean breeding values. We also present scaling
   results for the spatial autocovariance function for mean breeding values
   as well as that for the covariance between mean breeding value and the
   optimal phenotype expressing local adaption. Our results show in
   particular how these spatial scales depend on population density. For
   large densities the spatial scale of fluctuations in mean breeding
   values have similarities with corresponding results in population
   dynamics, where the effect of migration on spatial scales may be large
   if the local strength of density regulation is small. In our
   evolutionary model strength of density regulation corresponds to
   strength of local selection so that weak local selection may produce
   large spatial scales of autocovariances. Genetic drift and stochastic
   migration are shown to act through the population size within a
   characteristic area with much smaller variation in optimal phenotypes
   than in the whole population. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {We consider the diffusion approximation of the multivariate
   Wright-Fisher process with mutation. Analytically tractable formulas for
   the first-and second-order moments of the allele frequency distribution
   are derived, and the moments are subsequently used to better understand
   key population genetics parameters and modeling frameworks. In
   particular we investigate the behavior of the expected homozygosity (the
   probability that two randomly sampled genes are identical) in the
   transient and stationary phases, and how appropriate the Dirichlet
   distribution is for modeling the allele frequency distribution at
   different evolutionary time scales. We find that the Dirichlet
   distribution is adequate for the pure drift model (no mutations
   allowed), but the distribution is not sufficiently flexible for more
   general mutation models. We suggest a new hierarchical Beta distribution
   for the allele frequencies in the Wright-Fisher process with a mutation
   model on the nucleotide level that distinguishes between transitions and
   transversions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Demographic inference using genetic data from a single individual:
   Separating population size variation from population structure},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {104},
Pages = {46-58},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The rapid development of sequencing technologies represents new
   opportunities for population genetics research. It is expected that
   genomic data will increase our ability to reconstruct the history of
   populations. While this increase in genetic information will likely help
   biologists and anthropologists to reconstruct the demographic history of
   populations, it also represents new challenges. Recent work has shown
   that structured populations generate signals of population size change.
   As a consequence it is often difficult to determine whether demographic
   events such as expansions or contractions (bottlenecks) inferred from
   genetic data are real or due to the fact that populations are structured
   in nature. Given that few inferential methods allow us to account for
   that structure, and that genomic data will necessarily increase the
   precision of parameter estimates, it is important to develop new
   approaches. In the present study we analyze two demographic models. The
   first is a model of instantaneous population size change whereas the
   second is the classical symmetric island model. We (i) re-derive the
   distribution of coalescence times under the two models for a sample of
   size two, (ii) use a maximum likelihood approach to estimate the
   parameters of these models (iii) validate this estimation procedure
   under a wide array of parameter combinations, (iv) implement and
   validate a model rejection procedure by using a Kolmogorov Smirnov test,
   and a model choice procedure based on the AIC, and (v) derive the
   explicit distribution for the number of differences between two
   non-recombining sequences. Altogether we show that it is possible to
   estimate parameters under several models and perform efficient model
   choice using genetic data from a single diploid individual. (C) 2015

Title = {Mixing times towards demographic equilibrium in insect populations with
   temperature variable age structures},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {103},
Pages = {93-102},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {In this study, we use entropy related mixing rate modules to measure the
   effects of temperature on insect population stability and demographic
   breakdown. The uncertainty in the age of the mother of a randomly chosen
   newborn, and how it is moved after a finite act of time steps, is
   modeled using a stochastic transformation of the Leslie matrix. Age
   classes are represented as a cycle graph and its transitions towards the
   stable age distribution are brought forth as an exact Markov chain. The
   dynamics of divergence, from a non equilibrium state towards
   equilibrium, are evaluated using the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy. Moreover,
   Kullback-Leibler distance is applied as information-theoretic measure to
   estimate exact mixing times of age transitions probabilities towards
   equilibrium.
   Using empirically data, we show that on the initial conditions and
   simulated projection's trough time, that population entropy can
   effectively be applied to detect demographic variability towards
   equilibrium under different temperature conditions. Changes in entropy
   are correlated with the fluctuations of the insect population decay
   rates (i.e. demographic stability towards equilibrium). Moreover,
   shorter mixing times are directly linked to lower entropy rates and vice
   versa. This may be linked to the properties of the insect model system,
   which in contrast to warm blooded animals has the ability to greatly
   change its metabolic and demographic rates. Moreover, population entropy
   and the related distance measures that are applied, provide a means to
   measure these rates. The current results and model projections provide
   clear biological evidence why dynamic population entropy may be useful
   to measure population stability. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {Parasite infection drives the evolution of state-dependent dispersal of
   the host},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {92},
Pages = {1-13},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Dispersal plays a fundamental role in shaping the ecological processes
   such as host parasite interactions, and the understanding of host
   dispersal tendency leads to that of parasites. Here, we present the
   result of our study on how the evolutionarily stable dispersal of a host
   would depend on parasite infection, considering kin competition among
   neighbours. We show that the evolving dispersal rate might be higher for
   susceptible than for infected individuals (S-biased dispersal) or vice
   versa (I-biased dispersal). S-biased dispersal is favoured by strong
   virulence affecting competitive ability, by high rate of parasite
   release during dispersal, and by low virulence for infected emigrants
   (i.e. low virulence affecting dispersal ability), whereas I-biased
   dispersal is favoured in the opposite situation. We also discuss
   population structure or between-deme genetic differentiation of the host
   measured with Wright's F. In I-biased dispersal, between-deme genetic
   differentiation decreases with the infection rate, while in S-biased
   dispersal, genetic differentiation increases with infection rate. (c)

Title = {Genotype imputation in a coalescent model with infinitely-many-sites
   mutation},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {87},
Pages = {62-74},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Empirical studies have identified population-genetic factors as
   important determinants of the properties of genotype-imputation accuracy
   in imputation-based disease association studies. Here, we develop a
   simple coalescent model of three sequences that we use to explore the
   theoretical basis for the influence of these factors on
   genotype-imputation accuracy, under the assumption of
   infinitely-many-sites mutation. Employing a demographic model in which
   two populations diverged at a given time in the past, we derive the
   approximate expectation and variance of imputation accuracy in a study
   sequence sampled from one of the two populations, choosing between two
   reference sequences, one sampled from the same population as the study
   sequence and the other sampled from the other population. We show that,
   under this model, imputation accuracy as measured by the proportion of
   polymorphic sites that are imputed correctly in the study sequence
   increases in expectation with the mutation rate, the proportion of the
   markers in a chromosomal region that are genotyped, and the time to
   divergence between the study and reference populations. Each of these
   effects derives largely from an increase in information available for
   determining the reference sequence that is genetically most similar to
   the sequence targeted for imputation. We analyze as a function of
   divergence time the expected gain in imputation accuracy in the target
   using a reference sequence from the same population as the target rather
   than from the other population. Together with a growing body of
   empirical investigations of genotype imputation in diverse human
   populations, our modeling framework lays a foundation for extending
   imputation techniques to novel populations that have not yet been
   extensively examined. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Using mass scaling of movement cost and resource encounter rate to
   predict animal body size-Population density relationships},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {86},
Pages = {23-28},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The negative relationship between body mass and population abundance was
   documented decades ago and forms one of the most fundamental
   scaling-laws in ecology. However, current theory fails to capture
   observed variations and the subject continues to raise controversy. Here
   we unify empirically observed size-abundance relationships with theory,
   by incorporating allometries in resource encounter rate and metabolic
   costs of movements. Fractal geometry is used to quantify the underlying
   resources distributions. Our model predicts that in environments packed
   with resources, body mass to population abundance relationships is less
   negative than the commonly assumed -3/4 power law. When resources are
   more patchily distributed, we predict a more negative exponent. These
   predictions are consistent with empirical observations. The current
   research provides an important step towards synthesizing metabolism,
   resource distribution and the global scaling of animal abundance,
   explaining why size-abundance relationships vary among feeding guilds
   and ecosystems. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {An explicit transition density expansion for a multi-allelic
   Wright-Fisher diffusion with general diploid selection},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},

Abstract = {Characterizing time-evolution of allele frequencies in a population is a
   fundamental problem in population genetics. In the Wright-Fisher
   diffusion, such dynamics is captured by the transition density function,
   which satisfies well-known partial differential equations. For a
   multi-allelic model with general diploid selection, various theoretical
   results exist on representations of the transition density, but finding
   an explicit formula has remained a difficult problem. In this paper, a
   technique recently developed for a diallelic model is extended to find
   an explicit transition density for an arbitrary number of alleles, under
   a general diploid selection model with recurrent parent-independent
   mutation. Specifically, the method finds the eigenvalues and
   eigenfunctions of the generator associated with the multi-allelic
   diffusion, thus yielding an accurate spectral representation of the
   transition density. Furthermore, this approach allows for efficient,
   accurate computation of various other quantities of interest, including
   the normalizing constant of the stationary distribution and the rate of
   convergence to this distribution. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {Evolution of spite versus evolution of altruism through a disbandment
   mechanism},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {156},
Pages = {131-147},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Altruism and spite are costly to the actor, making their evolution
   unlikely without specific mechanisms. Nonetheless, both altruistic and
   spiteful behaviors are present in individuals, which suggests the
   existence of an underlying mechanism that drives their evolution. If
   altruistic individuals are more likely to be recipients of altruism than
   non-altruistic individuals, then altruism can be favored by natural
   selection. Similarly, if spiteful individuals are less likely to be
   recipients of spite than non-spiteful individuals, then spite can be
   favored by natural selection. Spite is altruism's evil twin, ugly sister
   of altruism, or a shady relative of altruism. In some mechanisms, such
   as repeated interactions, if altruism is favored by natural selection,
   then spite is also favored by natural selection. However, there has been
   limited investigation into whether both behaviors evolve to the same
   extent. In this study, we focus on the mechanism by which individuals
   choose to keep or stop the interaction according to the opponent's
   behavior. Using the evolutionary game theory, we investigate the
   evolution of altruism and spite under this mechanism. Our model revealed
   that the evolution of spite is less likely than the evolution of
   altruism.},

Title = {Evolution of trustfulness in the case where resources for cooperation
   are sometimes absent},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {145},
Pages = {63-79},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {It is worth investigating the existence of cooperation, which is costly
   for the actor but beneficial to the recipient (precisely because it is
   costly for the former). If players, when they approach defectors, stop
   their relationship with them, cooperation can pay off and favorably
   emerge in the course of evolutionary dynamics. The present study
   examines the situation in which animals, even when they want to
   cooperate, sometimes lack the necessary resources, and are thereby
   prevented from cooperating with others. In addition, it is also
   considered that the underlying information about the presence or absence
   of these resources can be conveyed to the opponent player. Here, the
   opponent who defects-has no resources for cooperation-may be a
   cooperator or a defector. Therefore, it is not clear which behavior is
   more likely to evolve, if it is keeping the interaction with such an
   opponent (i.e., being trustful) or stopping the interaction with such an
   opponent (i.e., being not trustful). By using evolutionary game theory,
   it is revealed that those who want to keep the interaction with those
   without the resources to cooperate are favored by natural selection.
   This study sheds new light on the role of keeping and stopping
   interaction in the evolution of cooperation under variable availability
   of resources.},

Abstract = {We present a method for inductively determining exact allele frequency
   spectrum (AFS) probabilities for samples derived from a population
   comprising two demes under the infinite-allele model of mutation. This
   method builds on a labeled coalescent argument to extend the Ewens
   sampling formula (ESF) to structured populations. A key departure from
   the panmictic case is that the AFS conditioned on the number of alleles
   in the sample is no longer independent of the scaled mutation rate
   (theta). In particular, biallelic site frequency spectra, widely-used in
   explorations of genome-wide patterns of variation, depend on the
   mutation rate in structured populations. Variation in the rate of
   substitution across loci and through time may contribute to apparent
   distortions of site frequency spectra exhibited by samples derived from
   structured populations. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {The inverse relationship between life expectancy-induced changes in the
   old-age dependency ratio and the prospective old-age dependency ratio},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {125},
Pages = {1-10},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Unlike other biological populations, the human population is
   experiencing long-run increases in life expectancy. Those lead to
   changes in age compositions not typical for other biological
   populations. Sanderson and Scherbov (2015a) demonstrated that, in many
   countries in Europe, faster increases in life expectancy lead to faster
   population aging when measured using the old-age dependency ratio and to
   slower population aging when measured using the prospective old-age
   dependency ratio that employs a dynamic old-age threshold. We examine
   this finding analytically and with simulations. We use an analytic
   decomposition of changes in mortality schedules into shift and
   compression processes. We show that shifts and compressions of mortality
   schedules push the two old-age dependency ratios in opposite directions.
   Our formal results are supported by simulations that show a positive
   effect of a mortality shift on the old-age dependency ratio and a
   negative effect of it on the prospective old-age dependency ratio. The
   effects are of opposite sign for a mortality compression. Our formal and
   simulation results generalize observed European trends and suggest that
   the inverse relationship between life expectancy and prospective old-age
   dependency would be observed more generally. (C) 2018 The Authors.

Title = {Computing the joint distribution of the total tree length across loci in
   populations with variable size},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {118},
Pages = {1-19},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In recent years, a number of methods have been developed to infer
   complex demographic histories, especially historical population size
   changes, from genomic sequence data. Coalescent Hidden Markov Models
   have proven to be particularly useful for this type of inference. Due to
   the Markovian structure of these models, an essential building block is
   the joint distribution of local genealogical trees, or statistics of
   these genealogies, at two neighboring loci in populations of variable
   size. Here, we present a novel method to compute the marginal and the
   joint distribution of the total length of the genealogical trees at two
   loci separated by at most one recombination event for samples of
   arbitrary size. To our knowledge, no method to compute these
   distributions has been presented in the literature to date. We show that
   they can be obtained from the solution of certain hyperbolic systems of
   partial differential equations. We present a numerical algorithm, based
   on the method of characteristics, that can be used to efficiently and
   accurately solve these systems and compute the marginal and the joint
   distributions. We demonstrate its utility to study the properties of the
   joint distribution. Our flexible method can be straightforwardly
   extended to handle an arbitrary fixed number of recombination events, to
   include the distributions of other statistics of the genealogies as
   well, and can also be applied in structured populations. (C) 2017

Title = {Variance in estimated pairwise genetic distance under high versus low
   coverage sequencing: The contribution of linkage disequilibrium},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {117},
Pages = {51-63},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The mean pairwise genetic distance among haplotypes is an estimator of
   the population mutation rate theta and a standard measure of variation
   in a population. With the advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS)
   methods, this and other population parameters can be estimated under
   different modes of sampling. One approach is to sequence individual
   genomes with high coverage, and to calculate genetic distance over all
   sample pairs. The second approach, typically used for microbial samples
   or for tumor cells, is sequencing a large number of pooled genomes with
   very low individual coverage. With low coverage, pairwise genetic
   distances are calculated across independently sampled sites rather than
   across individual genomes. In this study, we show that the variance in
   genetic distance estimates is reduced with low coverage sampling if the
   mean pairwise linkage disequilibrium weighted by allele frequencies is
   positive. Practically, this means that if on average the most frequent
   alleles over pairs of loci are in positive linkage disequilibrium, low
   coverage sequencing results in improved estimates of theta, assuming
   similar per-site read depths. We show that this result holds under the
   expected distribution of allele frequencies and linkage disequilibria
   for an infinite sites model at mutation-drift equilibrium. From
   simulations, we find that the conditions for reduced variance only fail
   to hold in cases where variant alleles are few and at very low
   frequency. These results are applied to haplotype frequencies from a
   lung cancer tumor to compute the weighted linkage disequilibria and the
   expected error in estimated genetic distance using high versus low
   coverage. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The game-theoretic model in this paper provides micro-foundations for
   the effect a harsher environment on the probability of cooperation among
   multiple players. The harshness of the environment is alternatively
   measured by the degree of complementarity between the players'
   cooperative efforts in producing a public good, and by the number of
   attacks on an existing public good that the players can collectively
   defend, where it is shown that these two measures of the degree of
   adversity facing the players operate in a similar fashion. We show that
   the effect of the degree of adversity on the probability of cooperation
   is monotonous, and has an opposite sign for smaller and for larger
   cooperation costs. For intermediate cooperation costs, we show that the
   effect of a harsher environment on the probability of cooperation is
   hill-shaped. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {112},
Pages = {117-125},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {We study a continuous time model for the frequency distribution of an
   infinitely large asexual population in which both beneficial and
   deleterious mutations occur and fitness is additive. When beneficial
   mutations are ignored, the exact solution for the frequency distribution
   is known to be a Poisson distribution. Here we include beneficial
   mutations and obtain exact expressions for the frequency distribution at
   all times using an eigenfunction expansion method. We find that the
   stationary distribution is non-Poissonian and related to the Bessel
   function of the first kind. We also provide suitable approximations for
   the stationary distribution and the time to relax to the steady state.
   Our exact results, especially at mutation-selection equilibrium, can be
   useful in developing semi-deterministic approaches to understand
   stochastic evolution. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Extinction probabilities and stationary distributions of mobile genetic
   elements in prokaryotes: The birth-death-diversification model},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {106},
Pages = {22-31},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Theoretical approaches are essential to our understanding of the complex
   dynamics of mobile genetic elements (MGEs) within genomes. Recently, the
   birth-death-diversification model was developed to describe the dynamics
   of mobile promoters (MPs), a particular class of MGEs in prokaryotes. A
   unique feature of this model is that genetic diversification of elements
   was included. To explore the implications of diversification on the
   longterm fate of MGE lineages, in this contribution we analyze the
   extinction probabilities, extinction times and equilibrium solutions of
   the birth-death-diversification model. We find that diversification
   increases both the survival and growth rate of MGE families, but the
   strength of this effect depends on the rate of horizontal gene transfer
   (HGT). We also find that the distribution of MGE families per genome is
   not necessarily monotonically decreasing, as observed for MPs, but may
   have a peak in the distribution that is related to the HGT rate. For MPs
   specifically, we find that new families have a high extinction
   probability, and predict that the number of MPs is increasing, albeit at
   a very slow rate. Additionally, we develop an extension of the
   birth-death-diversification model which allows MGEs in different regions
   of the genome, for example coding and non-coding, to be described by
   different rates. This extension may offer a potential explanation as to
   why the majority of MPs are located in non-promoter regions of the
   genome. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {A game-theoretic approach to valuating toxoplasmosis vaccination
   strategies},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {105},
Pages = {33-38},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The protozoan Toxoplasma gondii is a parasite often found in wild and
   domestic cats, and it is the cause of the disease toxoplasmosis. More
   than 60 million people in the United States carry the parasite, and the
   Centers for Disease Control have placed toxoplasmosis in their disease
   classification group Neglected Parasitic Infections as one of five
   parasitic diseases targeted as priorities for public health action. In
   recent years, there has been significant progress toward the development
   of a practical vaccine, so vaccination programs may soon be a viable
   approach to controlling the disease. Anticipating the availability of a
   toxoplasmosis vaccine, we are interested in determining when cat owners
   should vaccinate their own pets. We have created a mathematical model
   describing the conditions under which vaccination is advantageous. Our
   model can be used to predict the average vaccination level in the
   population. We find that there is a critical vaccine cost threshold
   above which no one will use the vaccine. A vaccine cost slightly below
   this threshold, however, results in high usage of the vaccine, and
   consequently in a significant reduction in population seroprevalence.
   Not surprisingly, we find that populations may achieve herd immunity
   only if the cost of vaccine is zero. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {In a randomly-mating biparental population of size N there are, with
   high probability, individuals who are genealogical ancestors of every
   extant individual within approximately log(2) (N) generations into the
   past. We use this result of]. Chang to prove a curious corollary under
   standard models of recombination: there exist, with high probability,
   individuals within a constant multiple of log2 (N) generations into the
   past who are simultaneously (i) genealogical ancestors of each of the
   individuals at the present, and (ii) genetic ancestors to none of the
   individuals at the present. Such ancestral individuals - ancestors of
   everyone today that left no genetic trace - represent `ghost' ancestors
   in a strong sense. In this short note, we use simple analytical argument
   and simulations to estimate how many such individuals exist in finite
   Wright-Fisher populations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Demography-adjusted tests of neutrality based on genome-wide SNP data},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {95},
Pages = {1-12},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Tests of the neutral evolution hypothesis are usually built on the
   standard null model which assumes that mutations are neutral and the
   population size remains constant over time. However, it is unclear how
   such tests are affected if the last assumption is dropped. Here, we
   extend the unifying framework for tests based on the site frequency
   spectrum, introduced by Achaz and Ferretti, to populations of varying
   size. Key ingredients are the first two moments of the site frequency
   spectrum. We show how these moments can be computed analytically if a
   population has experienced two instantaneous size changes in the past.
   We apply our method to data from ten human populations gathered in the
   1000 genomes project, estimate their demographies and define
   demography-adjusted versions of Tajima's D, Fay \& Wu's H, and Zeng's E.
   Our results show that demography-adjusted test statistics facilitate the
   direct comparison between populations and that most of the differences
   among populations seen in the original unadjusted tests can be explained
   by their underlying demographies. Upon carrying out whole-genome screens
   for deviations from neutrality, we identify candidate regions of recent
   positive selection. We provide track files with values of the adjusted
   and unadjusted tests for upload to the UCSC genome browser. (C) 2014

Title = {Jackknife-corrected parametric bootstrap estimates of growth rates in
   bivalve mollusks using nearest living relatives},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {90},
Pages = {36-48},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Quantitative estimates of growth rates can augment ecological and
   paleontological applications of bodysize data. However, in contrast to
   body-size estimates, assessing growth rates is often time-consuming,
   expensive, or unattainable. Here we use an indirect approach, a
   jackknife-corrected parametric bootstrap, for efficient approximation of
   growth rates using nearest living relatives with known age-size
   relationships. The estimate is developed by (1) collecting a sample of
   published growth rates of closely related species, (2) calculating the
   average growth curve using those published age-size relationships, (3)
   resampiing iteratively these empirically known growth curves to estimate
   the standard errors and confidence bands around the average growth
   curve, and (4) applying the resulting estimate of uncertainty to bracket
   age-size relationships of the species of interest. This approach was
   applied to three monophyletic families (Donacidae, Mactridae, and
   Semelidae) of mollusk bivalves, a group characterized by indeterministic
   shell growth, but widely used in ecological, paleontological, and
   geochemical research. The resulting indirect estimates were tested
   against two previously published geochemical studies and, in both cases,
   yielded highly congruent age estimates. In addition, a case study in
   applied fisheries was used to illustrate the potential of the proposed
   approach for augmenting aquaculture management practices. The resulting
   estimates of growth rates place body size data in a constrained temporal
   context and confidence intervals associated with resampling estimates
   allow for assessing the statistical uncertainty around derived temporal
   ranges. The indirect approach should allow for improved evaluation of
   diverse research questions, from sustainability of industrial shellfish
   harvesting to climatic interpretations of stable isotope proxies
   extracted from fossil skeletons. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {On spatial coalescents with multiple mergers in two dimensions},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {87},
Pages = {90-104},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {We consider the genealogy of a sample of individuals taken from a
   spatially structured population when the variance of the offspring
   distribution is relatively large. The space is structured into discrete
   sites of a graph G. If the population size at each site is large,
   spatial coalescents with multiple mergers, so called spatial
   Lambda-coalescents, for which ancestral lines migrate in space and
   coalesce according to some Lambda-coalescent mechanism, are shown to be
   appropriate approximations to the genealogy of a sample of individuals.
   We then consider as the graph G the two dimensional torus with side
   length 2L + 1 and show that as L tends to infinity, and time is rescaled
   appropriately, the partition structure of spatial Lambda-coalescents of
   individuals sampled far enough apart converges to the partition
   structure of a non-spatial Kingman coalescent. From a biological point
   of view this means that in certain circumstances both the spatial
   structure as well as larger variances of the underlying offspring
   distribution are harder to detect from the sample. However, supplemental
   simulations show that for moderately large L the different structure is
   still evident. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Evolutionary branching in a stochastic population model with discrete
   mutational steps},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {83},
Pages = {145-154},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Evolutionary branching is analysed in a stochastic, individual-based
   population model under mutation and selection. In such models, the
   common assumption is that individual reproduction and life career are
   characterised by values of a trait, and also by population sizes, and
   that mutations lead to small changes e in trait value. Then,
   traditionally, the evolutionary dynamics is studied in the limit epsilon
   -> 0. In the present approach, small but non-negligible mutational steps
   are considered. By means of theoretical analysis in the limit of
   infinitely large populations, as well as computer simulations, we
   demonstrate how discrete mutational steps affect the patterns of
   evolutionary branching. We also argue that the average time to the first
   branching depends in a sensitive way on both mutational step size and
   population size. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Stochastic viability in an island model with partial dispersal:
   Approximation by a diffusion process in the limit of a large number of
   islands},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {158},
Pages = {170-184},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {In this paper, we investigate a finite population undergoing evolution
   through an island model with partial dispersal and without mutation,
   where generations are discrete and non-overlapping. The population is
   structured into D demes, each containing N individuals of two possible
   types, A and B, whose viability coefficients, s(A) and s(B),
   respectively, vary randomly from one generation to the next. We assume
   that the means, variances and covariance of the viability coefficients
   are inversely proportional to the number of demes D, while higher-order
   moments are negligible in comparison to 1/D. We use a discrete-time
   Markov chain with two timescales to model the evolutionary process, and
   we demonstrate that as the number of demes D approaches infinity, the
   accelerated Markov chain converges to a diffusion process for any deme
   size N >= 2. This diffusion process allows us to evaluate the fixation
   probability of type A following its introduction as a single mutant in a
   population that was fixed for type B. We explore the impact of
   increasing the variability in the viability coefficients on this
   fixation probability. At least when N is large enough, it is shown that
   increasing this variability for type B or decreasing it for type A leads
   to an increase in the fixation probability of a single A. The effect of
   the population-scaled variances, sigma(2)(A) and sigma(2)(B), can even
   cancel the effects of the population-scaled means, mu(A) and mu(B). We
   also show that the fixation probability of a single A increases as the
   deme-scaled migration rate increases. Moreover, this probability is
   higher for type A than for type B if the population-scaled geometric
   mean viability coefficient is higher for type A than for type B, which
   means that mu(A )- sigma(2)(A)/2>mu(B )- sigma(2)(B)/2.},

Title = {Muller's ratchet in a near-critical regime: Tournament versus fitness
   proportional selection},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {158},
Pages = {121-138},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Muller's ratchet, in its prototype version, models a haploid, asexual
   population whose size N is constant over the generations. Slightly
   deleterious mutations are acquired along the lineages at a constant
   rate, and individuals carrying less mutations have a selective
   advantage. The classical variant considers fitness proportional
   selection, but other fitness schemes are conceivable as well. Inspired
   by the work of Etheridge et al. (2009) we propose a parameter scaling
   which fits well to the ``near-critical{''} regime that was in the focus
   of Etheridge et al. (2009) (and in which the mutation-selection ratio
   diverges logarithmically as N -> infinity). Using a Moran model, we
   investigate the ``rule of thumb{''} given in Etheridge et al. (2009) for
   the click rate of the ``classical ratchet{''} by putting it into the
   context of new results on the long-time evolution of the size of the
   best class of the ratchet with (binary) tournament selection. This
   variant of Muller's ratchet was introduced in Gonz \& aacute;lez
   Casanova et al. (2023), and was analysed there in a subcritical
   parameter regime. Other than that of the classical ratchet, the size of
   the best class of the tournament ratchet follows an autonomous dynamics
   up to the time of its extinction. It turns out that, under a suitable
   correspondence of the model parameters, this dynamics coincides with the
   so called Poisson profile approximation of the dynamics of the best
   class of the classical ratchet.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the stability of the Rosenzweig-MacArthur model
   distributed to identical discrete habitat patches. Migration between
   patches is assumed to follow the non-diffusive rule that individuals
   have a fixed rate of leaving their local habitat patch and migrating to
   another. Under this non-diffusive migration rule, we found that
   population dispersal on a non-regular and connected habitat network can
   both stabilize and destabilize the Rosenzweig-MacArthur model. It is
   also shown that our non-diffusive migration rule apparently becomes
   diffusive if the habitat network is regular. (c) 2023 The Author(s).

Title = {Measuring the external branches of a Kingman tree: A discrete approach},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {134},
Pages = {92-105},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The Kingman coalescent process is a classical model of gene genealogies
   in population genetics. It generates Yule-distributed, binary ranked
   tree topologies - also called histories - with a finite number of n
   leaves, together with n - 1 exponentially distributed time lengths: one
   for each layer of the history. Using a discrete approach, we study the
   lengths of the external branches of Yule distributed histories, where
   the length of an external branch is defined as the rank of its parent
   node. We study the multiplicity of external branches of given length in
   a random history of n leaves. A correspondence between the external
   branches of the ordered histories of size n and the non-peak entries of
   the permutations of size n - 1 provides easy access to the length
   distributions of the first and second longest external branches in a
   random Yule history and coalescent tree of size n. The length of the
   longest external branch is also studied in dependence of root balance of
   a random tree. As a practical application, we compare the observed and
   expected number of mutations on the longest external branches in samples
   from natural populations. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {<i>F<sub>ST</sub></i> and the triangle inequality for biallelic markers},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {133},
Pages = {117-129},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The population differentiation statistic F-ST, introduced by Sewall
   Wright, is often treated as a pairwise distance measure between
   populations. As was known to Wright, however, F-ST is not a true metric
   because allele frequencies exist for which it does not satisfy the
   triangle inequality. We prove that a stronger result holds: for
   biallelic markers whose allele frequencies differ across three
   populations, F-ST never satisfies the triangle inequality. We study the
   deviation from the triangle inequality as a function of the allele
   frequencies of three populations, identifying the frequency vector at
   which the deviation is maximal. We also examine the implications of the
   failure of the triangle inequality for four-point conditions for
   placement of groups of four populations on evolutionary trees. Next, we
   study the extent to which F-ST fails to satisfy the triangle inequality
   in human genomic data, finding that some loci produce deviations near
   the maximum. We provide results describing the consequences of the
   theory for various types of data analysis, including multidimensional
   scaling and inference of neighbor-joining trees from pairwise F-ST
   matrices. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {The popularity spectrum applied to a cross-cultural question},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},

Volume = {133},
Pages = {104-116},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {We investigate a new approach for identifying the contribution of
   horizontal transmission between groups to cross-cultural similarity.
   This method can be applied to datasets that record the presence or
   absence of artefacts, or attributes thereof, in archaeological and
   ethnographic assemblages, from which popularity spectra can be
   constructed. Based on analytical and simulation models, we show that the
   form of such spectra is sensitive to horizontal transmission between
   groups. We then fit the analytical model to existing datasets by
   Bayesian MCMC and obtain evidence for strong horizontal transmission in
   oceanic as opposed to continental datasets. We check the validity of our
   statistical method by using individual-based models, and show that the
   vertical transmission rate tends to be underestimated if the datasets
   are obtained from lattice-structured rather than island-structured
   meta-populations. We also suggest that there may be more borrowing of
   functional than stylistic traits, although the evidence for this is
   currently ambiguous. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.},

Title = {On cherry and pitchfork distributions of random rooted and unrooted
   phylogenetic trees},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {132},
Pages = {92-104},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Tree shape statistics are important for investigating evolutionary
   mechanisms mediating phylogenetic trees. As a step towards bridging
   shape statistics between rooted and unrooted trees, we present a
   comparison study on two subtree statistics known as numbers of cherries
   and pitchforks for the proportional to distinguishable arrangements
   (PDA) and the Yule-Harding-Kingman (YHK) models. Based on recursive
   formulas on the joint distribution of the number of cherries and that of
   pitchforks, it is shown that cherry distributions are log-concave for
   both rooted and unrooted trees under these two models. Furthermore, the
   mean number of cherries and that of pitchforks for unrooted trees
   converge respectively to those for rooted trees under the YHK model
   while there exists a limiting gap of 1/4 for the PDA model. Finally, the
   total variation distances between the cherry distributions of rooted and
   those of unrooted trees converge for both models. Our results indicate
   that caution is required for conducting statistical analysis for tree
   shapes involving both rooted and unrooted trees. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Title = {Eco-epidemiological interactions with predator interference and
   infection},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {130},
Pages = {191-202},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Predator interference is a form of competition between predator
   individuals over access to their prey. There is broad empirical evidence
   for interference to exist in different strengths in various types of
   ecological communities. At the same time, parasites are increasingly
   recognized to alter food web structure and dynamics. In order to
   investigate the eco-epidemiological interplay between interference and
   infection, we develop and analyze mathematical models of a predator-prey
   system, where the predators are subject to both interference and
   infectious disease. In the absence of infection, equilibrium predator
   density is known to show a non-monotonic response to interference by
   first increasing and then decreasing with increasing interference
   levels. We show that predator infection can change this pattern into a
   monotonically decreasing predator response to interference, provided the
   transmissibility is large enough and the pathogenicity is moderate such
   that the impact of disease on host population density prevails over
   interference effects. This holds for both types of disease transmission
   studied here, density-dependent and frequency-dependent. For
   density-dependent transmission, we find that intermediate values of
   interference can facilitate disease persistence, whereas the disease
   would disappear for small or large interference levels. By contrast, for
   frequency-dependent transmission, disease emergence is independent of
   interference levels. These dynamic interactions may be important for the
   understanding of potential biocontrol measures and of spread patterns of
   zoonotic diseases. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Volume = {127},
Pages = {16-32},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Probability modelling for DNA sequence evolution is well established and
   provides a rich framework for understanding genetic variation between
   samples of individuals from one or more populations. We show that both
   classical and more recent models for coalescence (with or without
   recombination) can be described in terms of the so-called phase-type
   theory, where complicated and tedious calculations are circumvented by
   the use of matrix manipulations. The application of phase-type theory in
   population genetics consists of describing the biological system as a
   Markov model by appropriately setting up a state space and calculating
   the corresponding intensity and reward matrices. Formulae of interest
   are then expressed in terms of these aforementioned matrices. We
   illustrate this procedure by a number of examples: (a) Calculating the
   mean, (co)variance and even higher order moments of the site frequency
   spectrum in multiple merger coalescent models, (b) Analysing a sample of
   DNA sequences from the Atlantic Cod using the Beta-coalescent, and (c)
   Determining the correlation of the number of segregating sites for
   multiple samples in the two-locus ancestral recombination graph. We
   believe that phase-type theory has great potential as a tool for
   analysing probability models in population genetics. The compact matrix
   notation is useful for clarification of current models, and in
   particular their formal manipulation and calculations, but also for
   further development or extensions. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {Haploids, polymorphisms and fluctuating selection},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {124},
Pages = {16-30},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {I analyze the joint impact of directional and fluctuating selection with
   reversible mutation in finite biallelic haploid populations using
   diffusion approximations of the Moran and chemostat models. Results
   differ dramatically from those of the classic Wright-Fisher diffusion.
   There, a strong dispersive effect attributable to fluctuating selection
   dissipates nascent polymorphisms promoted by a relatively weak emergent
   frequency dependent selective effect. The dispersive effect in the Moran
   diffusion with fluctuations every birth-death event is trivial. The same
   frequency dependent selective effect now dominates and polymorphism is
   promoted. The dispersive effect in the chemostat diffusion with
   fluctuations every generation is identical to that in the Wright-Fisher
   diffusion. Nevertheless, polymorphism is again promoted because the
   emergent frequency dependent effect is doubled, an effect attributable
   to geometric reproduction within generations. Fluctuating selection in
   the Moran and chemostat diffusions can also promote bi-allelic
   polymorphisms when one allele confers a net benefit. Rapid fluctuations
   within generations are highly effective at promoting polymorphism in
   large populations. The bi-allelic distribution is approximately Gaussian
   but becomes uniform and then U-shaped as the frequency of environmental
   fluctuations decreases to once a generation and then once every multiple
   generations. Trade-offs (negative correlations in fitness) help promote
   polymorphisms but are not essential. In all three models the frequency
   dependent effect raises the probability of ultimate fixation of new
   alleles, but less effectively in the Wright-Fisher diffusion.
   Individual-based forward simulations confirm the calculations. (C) 2018

Volume = {120},
Pages = {114-120},

Abstract = {We propose a model for the growth of microbial populations in the
   presence of a rate -limiting nutrient which accounts for the switching
   of cells to a dormant phase at low densities in response to decreasing
   concentration of a putative biochemical signal. We then show that in
   conditions of nutrient starvation, self -sustained oscillations can
   occur, thus providing a natural explanation for such phenomena as
   plankton blooms. However, unlike results of previous studies, the
   microbial population minima do not become unrealistically small, being
   buffered during minima by an increased dormant phase population. We also
   show that this allows microbes to survive in extreme environments for
   very long periods, consistent with observation. The mechanism provides a
   natural vehicle for other such sporadic outbreaks, such as viral
   epidemics. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {The distance decay of similarity in tropical rainforests. A spatial
   point processes analytical formulation},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {120},
Pages = {78-89},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {In this paper we are concerned with the analytical description of the
   change in floristic composition (species turnover) with the distance
   between two plots of a tropical rainforest due to the clustering of the
   individuals of the different species. We describe the plant arrangement
   by a superposition of spatial point processes and in this framework we
   introduce an analytical function which represents the average spatial
   density of the Sorensen similarity between two infinitesimal plots at
   distance r. We see that the decay in similarity with the distance is
   essentially described by the pair correlation function of the superposed
   process and that it is governed by the most abundant species. We test
   our analytical model with empirical data obtained for the Barro Colorado
   Island and Pasoh rainforests. To this end we adopt the statistical
   estimator for the pair correlation function in Shimatani (2001) and we
   design a novel one for the Sorensen similarity. Furthermore, we test our
   analytical formula by modeling the forest study area with Neyman-Scott
   point processes. We conclude comparing the advantages of our approach
   with other ones existing in literature. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All

Title = {Evolutionary rescue of a parasite population by mutation rate evolution},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {117},
Pages = {64-75},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The risk of antibiotic resistance evolution in parasites is a major
   problem for public health. Identifying factors which promote antibiotic
   resistance evolution is thus a priority in evolutionary medicine. The
   rate at which new mutations enter the parasite population is one
   important predictor; however, mutation rate is not necessarily a fixed
   quantity, as is often assumed, but can itself evolve. Here we explore
   the possible impacts of mutation rate evolution on the fate of a disease
   circulating in a host population, which is being treated with drugs, the
   use of which varies over time. Using an evolutionary rescue framework,
   we find that mutation rate evolution provides a dramatic increase in the
   probability that a parasite population survives treatment in only a
   limited region, while providing little or no advantage in other regions.
   Both epidemiological features, such as the virulence of infection, and
   population genetic parameters, such as recombination rate, play
   important roles in determining the probability of evolutionary rescue
   and whether mutation rate evolution enhances the probability of
   evolutionary rescue or not. While efforts to curtail mutation rate
   evolution in parasites may be worthwhile under some circumstances, our
   results suggest that this need not always be the case. (C) 2017 Elsevier

Title = {An approximate stationary solution for multi-allele neutral diffusion
   with low mutation rates},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {112},
Pages = {22-32},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {We address the problem of determining the stationary distribution of the
   multi-allelic, neutral-evolution Wright-Fisher model in the diffusion
   limit. A full solution to this problem for an arbitrary K x K mutation
   rate matrix involves solving for the stationary solution of a forward
   Kolmogorov equation over a (K 1) dimensional simplex, and remains
   intractable. In most practical situations mutations rates are slow on
   the scale of the diffusion limit and the solution is heavily
   concentrated on the corners and edges of the simplex. In this paper we
   present a practical approximate solution for slow mutation rates in the
   form of a set of line densities along the edges of the simplex. The
   method of solution relies on parameterising the general non-reversible
   rate matrix as the sum of a reversible part and a set of (K - 1) (K - 2)
   / 2 independent terms corresponding to fluxes of probability along
   closed paths around faces of the simplex. The solution is potentially a
   first step in estimating non-reversible evolutionary rate matrices from
   observed allele frequency spectra. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {Stabilization of species coexistence in spatial models through the
   aggregation-segregation effect generated by local dispersal and
   nonspecific local interactions},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {112},
Pages = {97-108},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Spatial interactions are widely acknowledged to play a significant role
   in sustaining diversity in ecological communities. However, theoretical
   work on this topic has focused on how spatial processes affect
   coexistence of species that differ in their strategies, with less
   attention to how spatial processes matter when competitors are
   equivalent. Furthermore, though it is recognized that models with local
   dispersal and local competition may sustain higher diversities of
   equivalent competitors than models in which these are not both
   localized, there is debate as to whether this reflects merely equalizing
   effects or whether there is also a stabilizing component. In this study,
   we explore how dispersal limitation and nonspecific local competition
   influence the outcome of species coexistence in communities driven by
   stochastic drift. We demonstrate that space alone acts as a stabilizing
   factor in a continuous space model with local dispersal and competition,
   as individuals of rare species on average experience lower total
   neighborhood densities, causing per capita reproductive rates to
   decrease systematically with increasing abundance. These effects prolong
   time to extinction in a closed system and enhance species diversity in
   an open system with constant immigration. Fundamentally, these
   stabilizing effects are obtained when dispersal limitation interacts
   with local competition to generate fluctuations in population growth
   rates. Thus this effect can be considered a fluctuating mechanism
   similar to spatial or temporal storage effects, but generated purely
   endogenously without requiring any exogenous environmental variability
   or species dissimilarities. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {We study a two-locus model of intersexual selection in a finite haploid
   population reproducing according to a discrete-time Moran model with a
   trait locus expressed in males and a preference locus expressed in
   females. We show that the probability of ultimate fixation of a single
   mutant allele for a male ornament introduced at random at the trait
   locus given any initial frequency state at the preference locus is
   increased by weak intersexual selection and recombination, weak or
   strong. Moreover, this probability exceeds the initial frequency of the
   mutant allele even in the case of a costly male ornament if intersexual
   selection is not too weak. On the other hand, the probability of
   ultimate fixation of a single mutant allele for a female preference
   towards a male ornament introduced at random at the preference locus is
   increased by weak intersexual selection and weak recombination if the
   female preference is not costly, and is strong enough in the case of a
   costly male ornament. The analysis relies on an extension of the
   ancestral recombination-selection graph for samples of haplotypes to
   take into account events of intersexual selection, while the symbolic
   calculation of the fixation probabilities is made possible in a
   reasonable time by an optimizing algorithm. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All

Title = {Aggregation dynamics explain vegetation patch-size distributions},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {108},
Pages = {70-74},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Vegetation patch-size distributions have been an intense area of study
   for theoreticians and applied ecologists alike in recent years. Of
   particular interest is the seemingly ubiquitous nature of power-law
   patch-size distributions emerging in a number of diverse ecosystems. The
   leading explanation of the emergence of these power-laws is due to local
   facilitative mechanisms. There is also a common transition from power
   law to exponential distribution when a system is under global pressure,
   such as grazing or lack of rainfall. These phenomena require a simple
   mechanistic explanation. Here, we study vegetation patches from a
   spatially implicit, patch dynamic viewpoint. We show that under minimal
   assumptions a power law patch-size distribution appears as a natural
   consequence of aggregation. A linear death term also leads to an
   exponential term in the distribution for any non-zero death rate. This
   work shows the origin of the breakdown of the power-law under increasing
   pressure and shows that in general, we expect to observe a power law
   with an exponential cutoff (rather than pure power laws). The estimated
   parameters of this distribution also provide insight into the underlying
   ecological mechanisms of aggregation and death. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Title = {Distance-responsive predation is not necessary for the Janzen-Connell
   hypothesis},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {106},
Pages = {60-70},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The Janzen-Connell hypothesis states that tree diversity in tropical
   forests is maintained by specialist predators that are distance- or
   density-responsive (i.e. predators that reduce seed or seedling survival
   near adults of their hosts). Many empirical studies have investigated
   whether predators are distance-responsive; however, few studies have
   examined whether distance-responsiveness matters for how predators
   maintain tree diversity. Using a site-occupancy model, we show
   analytically that distance-responsive predators are actually less able
   to maintain diversity than specialist predators that are not
   distance-responsive. Generally, specialist predators maintain diversity
   because they become rare when their host's densities are low, reducing
   predation risk. However, if predators are distance-responsive, and most
   seeds cannot disperse away from these predators, then seed predation
   rates will remain high, even if predator density is low across the
   landscape. Consequently, a reduction in a host's population density may
   not lead to a significant reduction in seed and seedling predation. We
   show that habitat partitioning can cause recruitment to be highest near
   conspecific adults, even in the presence of distance-responsive
   predators, without any change in the effect that the predators have on
   coexistence (a result contrary to predictions of the Janzen-Connell
   hypothesis). Rather, specialist predators and habitat partitioning have
   additive effects on species coexistence in our model, i.e., neither
   mechanism alters the effect of the other one. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All

Title = {The multivariate Dirichlet-multinomial distribution and its application
   in forensic genetics to adjust for subpopulation effects using the
   θ-correction},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {105},
Pages = {24-32},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {In this paper, we discuss the construction of a multivariate
   generalisation of the Dirichlet-multinomial distribution. An example
   from forensic genetics in the statistical analysis of DNA mixtures
   motivates the study of this multivariate extension.
   In forensic genetics, adjustment of the match probabilities due to
   remote ancestry in the population is often done using the so-called
   theta-correction. This correction increases the probability of observing
   multiple copies of rare alleles in a subpopulation and thereby reduces
   the weight of the evidence for rare genotypes.
   A recent publication by Cowell et al. (2015) showed elegantly how to use
   Bayesian networks for efficient computations of likelihood ratios in a
   forensic genetic context. However, their underlying population genetic
   model assumed independence of alleles, which is not realistic in real
   populations. We demonstrate how the so-called theta-correction can be
   incorporated in Bayesian networks to make efficient computations by
   modifying the Markov structure of Cowell et al. (2015).
   By numerical examples, we show how the theta-correction incorporated in
   the multivariate Dirichlet-multinomial distribution affects the weight
   of evidence. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Probability and time to fixation of an evolving sequence},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {104},
Pages = {78-85},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The propagation of a sequence in a population is traced using a
   branching process model of Poisson distributions. The sequence,
   initially inserted in a location of the genome of a single individual,
   is under selective pressure and can undergo detrimental, beneficial or
   even neutral mutations that allow for adaptive possibilities in the
   future. The exact solution for the ultimate probability of fixation (u)
   of the sequence in this model is a Lambert W function of mutation rates
   and selective values:
   u = 1 + W(-gamma . e(-(gamma+beta)))/gamma.
   where y = 1 + s - mu(d) - mu(b) beta = 2 alpha mu(b), s is the intrinsic
   coefficient of selection of the sequence (selective advantage is set by
   s > 0), mu(d) and mu(b) are the deleterious and beneficial rates of
   mutations that occur in the sequence and a is the effect of beneficial
   mutations. Predictions are adaptable to a wide range of situations,
   e.g., fixation of favourable mutations, local mutators or gene
   duplicates.
   The equation for the probability of fixation can be recursively nested,
   which leads to a non-obvious conclusion: the ultimate probability of
   fixation of the favourable combination of a number of rare events
   occurring in the sequence is not the product of the individual
   probabilities of the events but tends to be approximately proportional
   to the product of their square roots, which results in a remarkably high
   chance of fixation. This conclusion has implications in several topics
   of evolutionary genetics. The analysis also gives the distribution of
   the times of occurrence of the beneficial mutations that will lead to
   sequence fixation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Modeling the genealogy of a cultural trait},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {101},
Pages = {1-8},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The mathematical study of genealogies has yielded important insights in
   population biology, such as the ability to estimate the time to the most
   recent common ancestor (MRCA) of a sample of genetic sequences or of a
   group of individuals. Here we introduce a model of cultural genealogies
   that is a step toward answering similar questions for cultural traits.
   In our model individuals can inherit from a variable, potentially large
   number of ancestors, rather than from a fixed, small number of ancestors
   (one or two) as is typical of genetic evolution. We first show that,
   given a sample of individuals, a cultural common ancestor does not
   necessarily exist. We then introduce a related concept: the most recent
   unique ancestor (MRUA), i.e., the most recent single individual who is
   the earliest cultural ancestor of the sample. We show that, under
   neutral evolution, the time to the MRUA can be staggeringly larger than
   the time to MRCA in a single ancestor model, except when the average
   number of learning opportunities per individuals is small. Our results
   point out that the properties of cultural genealogies may be very
   different from those of genetic genealogies, with potential implications
   for reconstructing the histories of cultural traits. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The coupled dynamics of the size and the mean cultural/technological
   level of a population, with positive feedback between these two
   variables, is modeled in the Malthusian-Boserupian framework.
   Bifurcation diagrams, with innovativeness or the cultureless carrying
   capacity as the parameter, show that abrupt transitions in the mean
   cultural level are possible. For example, a gradual evolutionary change
   toward greater innate innovativeness would produce an associated gradual
   increase in mean cultural level, until a threshold is crossed that
   triggers an abrupt cultural regime shift. Hence, the model may help
   explain the apparently sudden and dramatic efflorescences of
   Palaeolithic/Stone Age culture during the Late Pleistocene, without
   having to invoke major contemporaneous genetic changes in cognition. The
   results of statistical studies on the association between population
   size and toolkit diversity among ethnographic societies are also
   discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Quantifying stochastic introgression processes in random environments
   with hazard rates},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {100},
Pages = {1-5},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Introgression is the permanent incorporation of genes from the genome of
   one population into another. Previous studies have found that
   stochasticity in number of offspring, hybridisation, and environment are
   important aspects of introgression risk, but these factors have been
   studied separately. In this paper we extend the use of the hazard rate
   which we previously used to study effects of demographic stochasticity
   with repeated invasion attempts, to incorporate temporal environmental
   stochasticity. We find that introgression risk varies much in time, and
   in some periods it can be much enhanced in such environments.

Title = {Non-identifiability of identity coefficients at biallelic loci},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {92},
Pages = {22-29},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Shared genealogies introduce allele dependences in diploid genotypes, as
   alleles within an individual or between different individuals will
   likely match when they originate from a recent common ancestor. At a
   locus shared by a pair of diploid individuals, there are nine
   combinatorially distinct modes of identity-by-descent (IBD), capturing
   all possible combinations of coancestry and inbreeding. A distribution
   over the IBD modes is described by the nine associated probabilities,
   known as (jacquard's) identity coefficients. The genetic relatedness
   between two individuals can be succinctly characterized by the identity
   coefficients corresponding to a pedigree that contains both individuals.
   The identity coefficients (together with allele frequencies) determine
   the distribution of joint genotypes at a locus. At a locus with two
   possible alleles, identity coefficients are not identifiable because
   different coefficients can generate the same genotype distribution.
   We analyze precisely how different IBD modes combine into identical
   genotype distributions at diallelic loci. In particular, we describe IBD
   mode mixtures that result in identical genotype distributions at all
   allele frequencies, implying the non-identifiability of the identity
   coefficients from independent loci. Our analysis yields an exhaustive
   characterization of relatedness statistics that are always identifiable.
   Importantly, we show that identifiable relatedness statistics include
   the kinship coefficient (probability that a random pair of alleles are
   identical by descent between individuals) and inbreeding-related
   measures, which can thus be estimated consistently from genotype
   distributions at independent loci. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {87},
Pages = {15-24},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {We apply recently developed inference methods based on general
   coalescent processes to DNA sequence data obtained from various marine
   species. Several of these species are believed to exhibit so-called
   shallow gene genealogies, potentially due to extreme reproductive
   behaviour, e.g. via Hedgecock's ``reproduction sweepstakes{''}. Besides
   the data analysis, in particular the inference of mutation rates and the
   estimation of the (real) time to the most recent common ancestor, we
   briefly address the question whether the genealogies might be adequately
   described by so-called Beta-coalescents (as opposed to Kingman's
   coalescent), allowing multiple mergers of genealogies.
   The choice of the underlying coalescent model for the genealogy has
   drastic implications for the estimation of the above quantities, in
   particular the real-time embedding of the genealogy. (c) 2012 Elsevier

Title = {Modeling effective transmission pathways and control of the world's most
   successful parasite},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {86},
Pages = {50-61},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) is a single-celled, intracellular
   protozoan responsible for the disease toxoplasmosis. The parasite is
   prevalent worldwide, and it infects all warm-blooded vertebrates.
   Consumption of meats in which this parasite has encysted confers risk of
   infection to people and other animals, as does ingestion of water or
   foods contaminated with environmentally resistant oocysts excreted by
   cats. Vertical transmission (from mother to offspring) is also possible,
   leading to disease risk and contributing additional means of ensuring
   perpetuation of transmission. In this work, we adopt a differential
   equation model to investigate the effective transmission pathways of T.
   gondii, as well as potential control mechanisms. Detailed analyses are
   carried out to examine the significance of transmission routes,
   virulence, vertical transmission, parasite-induced changes in host
   behavior, and controls based on vaccination and harvesting. Modeling and
   analysis efforts may shed insights into understanding the complex life
   cycle of T. gondii. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Unifying quantification methods for sexual selection and assortative
   mating using information theory},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {158},
Pages = {206-215},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Sexual selection plays a crucial role in modern evolutionary theory,
   offering valuable insight into evolutionary patterns and species
   diversity. Recently, a comprehensive definition of sexual selection has
   been proposed, defining it as any selection that arises from fitness
   differences associated with nonrandom success in the competition for
   access to gametes for fertilization. Previous research on discrete
   traits demonstrated that nonrandom mating can be effectively quantified
   using Jeffreys (or symmetrized Kullback-Leibler) divergence, capturing
   information acquired through mating influenced by mutual mating
   propensities instead of random occurrences. This novel theoretical
   framework allows for detecting and assessing the strength of sexual
   selection and assortative mating. In this study, we aim to achieve two
   primary objectives. Firstly, we demonstrate the seamless alignment of
   the previous theoretical development, rooted in information theory and
   mutual mating propensity, with the aforementioned definition of sexual
   selection. Secondly, we extend the theory to encompass quantitative
   traits. Our findings reveal that sexual selection and assortative mating
   can be quantified effectively for quantitative traits by measuring the
   information gain relative to the random mating pattern. The connection
   of the information indices of sexual selection with the classical
   measures of sexual selection is established. Additionally, if mating
   traits are normally distributed, the measure capturing the underlying
   information of assortative mating is a function of the square of the
   correlation coefficient, taking values within the non-negative real
   number set {[}0, +infinity). It is worth noting that the same divergence
   measure captures information acquired through mating for both discrete
   and quantitative traits. This is interesting as it provides a common
   context and can help simplify the study of sexual selection patterns.},

Title = {Modeling temporal dynamics of genetic diversity in stage-structured
   plant populations with reference to demographic genetic structure},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {148},
Pages = {76-85},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Predicting temporal dynamics of genetic diversity is important for
   assessing long-term population persistence. In stage-structured
   populations, especially in perennial plant species, genetic diversity is
   often compared among life history stages, such as seedlings, juveniles,
   and flowerings, using neutral genetic markers. The comparison among
   stages is sometimes referred to as demographic genetic structure, which
   has been regarded as a proxy of potential genetic changes because
   individuals in mature stages will die and be replaced by those in more
   immature stages over the course of time. However, due to the lack of
   theoretical examination, the basic property of the stage-wise genetic
   diversity remained unclear. We developed a matrix model which was made
   up of difference equations of the probability of
   non-identical-by-descent of each life history stage at a neutral locus
   to describe the dynamics and the inter-stage differences of genetic
   diversity in stage-structured plant populations. Based on the model, we
   formulated demographic genetic structure as well as the annual change
   rate of the probability of non-identical-by-descent (denoted as eta). We
   checked if theoretical expectations on demographic genetic structure and
   eta obtained from our model agreed with computational results of
   stochastic simulation using randomly generated 3,000 life histories. We
   then examined the relationships of demographic genetic structure with
   effective population size Ne, which is the determinants of diversity
   loss per generation time. Theoretical expectations on eta and
   demographic genetic structure fitted well to the results of stochastic
   simulation, supporting the validity of our model. Demographic genetic
   structure varied independently of Ne and eta, while having a strong
   correlation with stable stage distribution: genetic diversity was lower
   in stages with fewer individuals. Our results indicate that demographic
   genetic structure strongly reflects stable stage distribution, rather
   than temporal genetic dynamics, and that inferring future genetic
   diversity solely from demographic genetic structure would be misleading.
   Instead of demographic genetic structure, we propose eta as an useful
   tool to predict genetic diversity at the same time scale as population
   dynamics (i.e., per year), facilitating evaluation on population
   viability from a genetic point of view.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {Switching environments, synchronous sex, and the evolution of mating
   types},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {138},
Pages = {28-42},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {While facultative sex is common in sexually reproducing species, for
   reasons of tractability most mathematical models assume that such sex is
   asynchronous in the population. In this paper, we develop a model of
   switching environments to instead capture the effect of an entire
   population transitioning synchronously between sexual and asexual modes
   of reproduction. We use this model to investigate the evolution of the
   number of self-incompatible mating types in finite populations, which
   empirically can range from two to thousands. When environmental
   switching is fast, we recover the results of earlier studies that
   implicitly assumed populations were engaged in asynchronous sexual
   reproduction. However when the environment switches slowly, we see
   deviations from previous asynchronous theory, including a lower number
   of mating types at equilibrium and bimodality in the stationary
   distribution of mating types. We provide analytic approximations for
   both the fast and slow switching regimes, as well as a numerical scheme
   based on the Kolmogorov equations for the system to quickly evaluate the
   model dynamics at intermediate parameters. Our approach exploits
   properties of integer partitions in number theory. We also demonstrate
   how additional biological processes such as selective sweeps can be
   accounted for in this switching environment framework, showing that
   beneficial mutations can further erode mating type diversity in
   synchronous facultatively sexual populations. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All

Title = {The effects of diploid male production on honey bee colony evolution and
   survival},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {135},
Pages = {49-55},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The order Hymenoptera includes most of the eusocial species on the
   planet. Correlated is the fact that many of the social species within
   the order are haplodiploid and use complementary sex determination (CSD)
   to determine the sex of offspring. CSD is the mechanism by why single
   sex alleles within an organism result in male development (haploid) and
   mismatched sex alleles develop into females (diploids). Related to this
   is the production of diploid males: fertilized eggs with matched sex
   alleles which develop as male instead of female. Honey bees are no
   exception to this, and as their numbers continue to suffer globally and
   their genetic diversity lowers, the effects of diploid male production
   (DMP) may pose an increased risk to the survival of bee colonies. In the
   present study, we develop a model for diploid male production in a honey
   bee colony and show that with ample resources, this phenomena has little
   effect on a colony's health, but there is a limit to the sustainability
   of a colony suffering from diploid male production. We use our model to
   show that there were likely no great evolutionary pressures against CSD
   and DMP in wild honey bees as its effects on colony health in the wild
   would have been negligible but increased environmental hazards such as
   pesticides and monoculture crops increase the effects of DMP on colony
   health. (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Pages = {69-81},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {In a model of vertical and oblique cultural transmission of a
   dichotomous trait, the rates of transmission of each form of the trait
   are functions of the trait frequency in the population. Sufficient
   conditions on these functions are derived for a stable trait
   polymorphism to exist. If the vertical transmission rates are monotone
   decreasing functions of the trait frequency, a complete global stability
   analysis is presented. It is also shown that a unique protected
   polymorphism can be globally stable even though the sufficient
   conditions are not met. The evolution of frequency-dependent
   transmission is modeled using modifier theory, and exact conditions are
   derived for a transmission modifier to invade a population at a stable
   polymorphism. Finally, the interaction between frequency-dependent
   selection and frequency-dependent transmission is explored. (C) 2019 The

Abstract = {A simple competition model with time varying periodic coefficients, in
   which two species use different reproduction strategies, is explored in
   this paper. The two species considered comprise a native species which
   reproduces once a year over a short time period and an invasive species
   which is capable of reproducing throughout the entire year. A
   monotonicity property of the model is instrumental for its analysis. The
   model reveals that the time difference between the peak of reproduction
   for the two species is a critical factor in determining the outcome of
   competition between these species. The impact of climate change and an
   anthropogenic disturbance, comprising the creation of additional
   substrate, is also investigated using a modified model. The results of
   this paper describe how climate change will favour the invasive species
   by reducing the time period between the reproductive peaks of the two
   species and how the addition of new substrates is likely to endanger a
   small population of either of the two species, depending on the timing
   of the introduction of the substrates. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Pages = {2-11},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {For a panmictic population of constant size evolving under neutrality,
   Kingman's coalescent describes the genealogy of a population sample in
   equilibrium. However, for genealogical trees under selection, not even
   expectations for most basic quantities like height and length of the
   resulting random tree are known. Here, we give an analytic expression
   for the distribution of the total tree length of a sample of size n
   under low levels of selection in a two-alleles model. We can prove that
   trees are shorter than under neutrality under genic selection and if the
   beneficial mutant has dominance h < 1/2, but longer for h > 1/2. The
   difference from neutrality is O(alpha(2)) for genic selection with
   selection intensity alpha and O(alpha) for other modes of dominance. (C)

Abstract = {Reciprocal monophyly, a feature of a genealogy in which multiple groups
   of descendant lineages each consist of all of the descendants of their
   respective most recent common ancestors, has been an important concept
   in studies of species delimitation, phylogeography, population history
   reconstruction, systematics, and conservation. Computations involving
   the probability that reciprocal monophyly is observed in a genealogy
   have played a key role in criteria for defining taxonomic groups and
   inferring divergence times. The probability of reciprocal monophyly
   under a coalescent model of population divergence has been studied in
   detail for groups of gene lineages for pairs of species. Here, we extend
   this computation to generate corresponding probabilities for sets of
   gene lineages from three and four species. We study the effects of model
   parameters on the probability of reciprocal monophyly, finding that it
   is driven primarily by species tree height, with lesser but still
   substantial influences of internal branch lengths and sample sizes. We
   also provide an example application of our results to data from maize
   and teosinte. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Cyclic outbreaks of forest insects: A two-dimensional individual-based
   model},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {128},
Pages = {1-18},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {An individual-based model is presented which shows that cyclic insects
   outbreaks in the forest (here presented as a certain type of the
   dynamics of total numbers of insects in the forest) can be a result of
   the joint action of four factors: (1) spatial structure of the system -
   resources, green tree biomass, used by larval insects are distributed in
   a two-dimensional space, (2) properties of trees - their limited
   resistance to feeding by insects, and regeneration ability after some
   time of relaxation, when they cannot sustain a local insect population,
   (3) insect properties - the most important of which is the ability of
   adult individuals to move between spatially distributed resources and to
   lay eggs on neighbouring trees, and (4) the type of dynamics of local
   insect population exploiting resources of a tree, which depends on
   individual variability of insects and their progeny production. Insects
   disperse from the original tree and occupy successive not infested trees
   over the forest, omitting the trees with exploited resources that need
   time for regeneration. The cyclic outbreak dynamics will take place when
   insects have opportunity to return to the places where there are trees
   with regenerated resources. In addition to the cyclic outbreak, we will
   observe permanent outbreaks (small fluctuations of insect, combined with
   a similar dynamics of tree biomass) or pulse outbreaks (an increase in
   the number of insects, followed by their extinction and leading to a
   temporary destruction of tree biomass). The type of the simulation
   output will depend on the values of the model parameters. Intermediate
   resistance of trees to insect feeding and their not very short
   regeneration time will lead to cyclic outbreaks. Additionally great
   number of dispersing insects will promote cyclic outbreaks. High degree
   of individual variability, high mortality of adult insects or small
   progeny production will produce favourable conditions for permanent
   outbreaks. Pulse outbreaks can easily occur when insect individual
   variability is small or progeny production is high. (C) 2019 Elsevier

Title = {On the joint distribution of tree height and tree length under the
   coalescent},

Abstract = {Many statistics that examine genetic variation depend on the underlying
   shapes of genealogical trees. Under the coalescent model, we investigate
   the joint distribution of two quantities that describe genealogical tree
   shape: tree height and tree length. We derive a recursive formula for
   their exact joint distribution under a demographic model of a
   constant-sized population. We obtain approximations for the mean and
   variance of the ratio of tree height to tree length, using them to show
   that this ratio converges in probability to 0 as the sample size
   increases. We find that as the sample size increases, the correlation
   coefficient for tree height and length approaches (pi(2) - 6)/{[}pi root
   2 pi(2) - 18] approximate to 0.9340. Using simulations, we examine the
   joint distribution of height and length under demographic models with
   population growth and population subdivision. We interpret the joint
   distribution in relation to problems of interest in data analysis,
   including inference of the time to the most recent common ancestor. The
   results assist in understanding the influences of demographic histories
   on two fundamental features of tree shape. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All

Pages = {36-45},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {In many areas of genetics it is of relevance to consider a population of
   individuals that is founded by a single individual in the past. One
   model for such a scenario is the conditioned reconstructed process with
   Bernoulli sampling that describes the evolution of a population of
   individuals that originates from a single individual. Several aspects of
   this reconstructed process are studied, in particular the Markov
   structure of the process. It is shown that at any given time in the
   past, the conditioned reconstructed process behaves as the original
   conditioned reconstructed process after a suitable time-dependent change
   of the sampling probability. Additionally, it is discussed how mutations
   accumulate in a sample of particles. It is shown that random sampling of
   particles at the present time has the effect of making the mutation rate
   look time-dependent. Conditions are given under which this sampling
   effect is negligible. A possible extension of the reconstructed process
   that allows for multiple founding particles is discussed. (C) 2018

Title = {Weight of the evidence of genetic investigations of ancestry informative
   markers},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {120},
Pages = {1-10},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Ancestry-informative markers (AIMs) are markers that give information
   about the ancestry of individuals. They are used in forensic genetics
   for predicting the geographic origin of the investigated individual in
   crime and identification cases. In the exploration of the genogeographic
   origin of an AIMs profile, the likelihoods of the AIMs profile in
   various populations may be calculated. However, there may not be an
   appropriate reference population in the database. The fact that the
   likelihood ratio (LR) of one population compared to that of another
   population is large does not imply that any of the populations is
   relevant.
   To handle this phenomena, we derived a likelihood ratio test (LRT) that
   is a measure of absolute concordance between an AIMs profile and a
   population rather than a relative measure of the AIMs profile's
   likelihood in two populations. The LRT is similar to a Fisher's exact
   test. By aggregating over markers, the central limit theorem suggests
   that the resulting quantity is approximately normally distributed. If
   only a few markers are genotyped or if the majority of the markers are
   fixed in a given population, the approximation may fail. We overcome
   this using importance sampling and show how exponential tilting results
   in an efficient proposal distribution.
   By simulations and published AIMs profiles, we demonstrate the
   applicability of the derived methodology. For the genotyped AIMs, the
   LRT approach achieves the nominal levels of rejection when tested on
   data from five major continental regions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All

Title = {Trait level analysis of multitrait population projection matrices},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {116},
Pages = {47-58},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {In most matrix population projection models, individuals are
   characterized according to, usually, one or two traits such as age,
   stage, size or location. A broad theory of multitrait population
   projection matrices (MPPMs) incorporating larger number of traits was
   long held back by time and space computational complexity issues. As a
   consequence, no study has yet focused on the influence of the structure
   of traits describing a life-cycle on population dynamics and
   life-history evolution.
   We present here a novel vector-based MPPM building methodology that
   allows to computationally efficiently model populations characterized by
   numerous traits with large distributions, and extend sensitivity
   analyses for these models. We then present a new method, the trait level
   analysis consisting in folding an MPPM on any of its traits to create a
   matrix with alternative trait structure (the number of traits and their
   characteristics) but similar asymptotic properties. Adding or removing
   one or several traits to/from the MPPM and analyzing the resulting
   changes in spectral properties, allows investigating the influence of
   the trait structure on the evolution of traits.
   We illustrate this by modeling a 3-trait (age, parity and fecundity)
   population designed to investigate the implications of parity-fertility
   trade-offs in a context of fecundity heterogeneity in humans. The trait
   level analysis, comparing models of the same population differing in
   trait structures, demonstrates that fertility selection gradients differ
   between cases with or without parity-fertility trade-offs. Moreover it
   shows that age-specific fertility has seemingly very different
   evolutionary significance depending on whether heterogeneity is
   accounted for. This is because trade-offs can vary strongly in strength
   and even direction depending on the trait structure used to model the
   population. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Adaptive diversification in heterogeneous environments},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {114},
Pages = {1-9},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The role of environmental heterogeneity in the evolution of biological
   diversity has been studied only for simple types of heterogeneities and
   dispersals. This article broadens previous results by considering
   heterogeneities and dispersals that are structured by several
   environmental factors. It studies the evolution of a metapopulation,
   living in a network of patches connected by dispersal, under the effects
   of mutation, selection and migration. First, it is assumed that patches
   are equally connected and that they carry habitats characterized by
   several factors exerting selection pressures on several individual
   traits. Habitat factors may vary in the environment independently or
   they may be correlated. It is shown that correlations between habitat
   factors promote adaptive diversification and that this effect may be
   modified by trait interactions on survival. Then, it is assumed that
   patches are structured by two crossed factors, called the row and column
   factors, such that patches are more connected when they occur in the
   same row or in the same column. Environmental patterns in which each
   habitat appears in each row the same number of times and appears in each
   column the same number of times are found to hinder adaptive
   diversification. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Demographic inference under the coalescent in a spatial continuum},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {111},
Pages = {43-50},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Understanding population dynamics from the analysis of molecular and
   spatial data requires sound statistical modeling. Current approaches
   assume that populations are naturally partitioned into discrete demes,
   thereby failing to be relevant in cases where individuals are scattered
   on a spatial continuum. Other models predict the formation of
   increasingly tight clusters of individuals in space, which, again,
   conflicts with biological evidence. Building on recent theoretical work,
   we introduce a new genealogy based inference framework that alleviates
   these issues. This approach effectively implements a stochastic model in
   which the distribution of individuals is homogeneous and stationary,
   thereby providing a relevant null model for the fluctuation of genetic
   diversity in time and space. Importantly, the spatial density of
   individuals in a population and their range of dispersal during the
   course of evolution are two parameters that can be inferred separately
   with this method. The validity of the new inference framework is
   confirmed with extensive simulations and the analysis of influenza
   sequences collected over five seasons in the USA. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Title = {Characteristics of temporal changes in communities where dynamics differ
   between species},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {111},
Pages = {65-74},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Communities with different phenotypic variation among species can have
   identical species abundance distributions, although their temporal
   dynamics may be very different. By using stochastic species abundance
   models, both the lognormal and beta prime abundance distributions can be
   obtained with either homogeneous or heterogeneous dynamics among
   species. Assuming that anthropogenic activity disturbs the communities
   such that species' carrying capacities are decreasing deterministically,
   the structure of the communities are studied using simulations. In order
   to construct homogeneous communities with reasonable variation in
   abundance, the parameter values describing the dynamics of the species
   can be unrealistic in terms of long return times to equilibrium. Species
   in heterogeneous communities can have stronger density regulation, while
   maintaining the same variation in abundance, by assuming heterogeneity
   in one of the dynamical parameters. The heterogeneity generates
   variation in carrying capacity among species, while reducing the
   temporal stochasticity. If carrying capacity decreases, changes in
   community structure occur at a much slower rate for the homogeneous
   compared to the heterogeneous communities. Even over short time periods,
   the difference in response to deterministic changes in carrying capacity
   between homogeneous and heterogeneous community models can be
   substantial, making the heterogeneous model a recommended starting point
   for community analysis. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Competition, coinfection and strain replacement in models of
   <i>Bordetella pertussis!</i>},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {103},
Pages = {84-92},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Pertussis, or whooping cough, is an important respiratory infection
   causing considerable infant mortality worldwide. Recently, incidence has
   risen in countries with strong vaccine programmes and there are concerns
   about antigenic shift resulting in vaccine evasion. Interactions between
   pertussis and non-vaccine-preventable strains will play an important
   role in the evolution and population dynamics of pertussis. In
   particular, if we are to understand the role strain replacement plays in
   vaccinated settings, it will be essential to understand how strains or
   variants of pertussis interact. Here we explore under what conditions we
   would expect strain replacement to be of concern in pertussis. We
   develop a dynamic transmission model that allows for coinfection between
   Bordetella pertussis (the main causative agent of pertussis) and a
   strain or variant unaffected by the vaccine. We incorporate both
   neutrality (in the sense of ecological/population genetic neutrality)
   and immunity into the model, leaving the specificity of the immune
   response flexible. We find that strain replacement may be considerable
   when immunity is non-specific. This is in contrast to previous findings
   where neutrality was not considered. We conclude that the extent to
   which models reflect ecological neutrality can have a large impact on
   conclusions regarding strain replacement. This will likely have onward
   consequences for estimates of vaccine efficacy and cost-effectiveness.

Title = {Matrix inversions for chromosomal inversions: A method to construct
   summary statistics in complex coalescent models},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {97},
Pages = {1-10},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Chromosomal inversions allow genetic divergence of locally adapted
   populations by reducing recombination between chromosomes with different
   arrangements. While patterns of genetic variation within inverted
   regions are increasingly documented, inferential methods are largely
   missing to analyze such data. Previous work has provided expectations
   for coalescence patterns of neutral sites linked to an inversion
   polymorphism in two locally adapted populations. Here, we define a
   method to construct summary statistics in such complex population
   structure models. Under a scenario of selection on the inversion
   breakpoints, we first construct estimators of the migration rate between
   the two habitats, and of the recombination rate of a nucleotide site
   between the two inversion backgrounds. Next, we analyze the
   disequilibrium between two sites within an inversion and provide an
   estimator of the distinct recombination rate between these two sites in
   homokaryotypes and heterokaryotypes. These estimators should be suitable
   summary statistics for simulation-based methods that can handle the
   complex dependences in the data. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {Stochastic population dynamics in a Markovian environment implies
   Taylor's power law of fluctuation scaling},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {93},
Pages = {30-37},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Taylor's power law of fluctuation scaling (TL) states that for
   population density, population abundance, biomass density, biomass
   abundance, cell mass, protein copy number, or any other
   nonnegative-valued random variable in which the mean and the variance
   are positive, variance = a(mean)(b), a > 0, or equivalently log variance
   = log a + b x log mean. Many empirical examples and practical
   applications of TL are known, but understanding of TL's origins and
   interpretations remains incomplete. We show here that, as time becomes
   large, TL arises from multiplicative population growth in which
   successive random factors are chosen by a Markov chain. We give exact
   formulas for a and b in terms of the Markov transition matrix and the
   values of the successive multiplicative factors. In this model, the mean
   and variance asymptotically increase exponentially if and only if b > 2
   and asymptotically decrease exponentially if and only if b < 2. (c) 2014

Title = {A mathematical description of the inclusive fitness theory},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {84},
Pages = {46-55},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Recent developments in the inclusive fitness theory have revealed that
   the direction of evolution can be analytically predicted in a wider
   class of models than previously thought, such as those models dealing
   with network structure. This paper aims to provide a mathematical
   description of the inclusive fitness theory. Specifically, we provide a
   general framework based on a Markov chain that can implement basic
   models of inclusive fitness. Our framework is based on the probability
   distribution of ``offspring-to-parent map{''}, from which the key
   concepts of the theory, such as fitness function, relatedness and
   inclusive fitness, are derived in a straightforward manner. We prove
   theorems showing that inclusive fitness always provides a correct
   prediction on which of two competing genes more frequently appears in
   the long run in the Markov chain. As an application of the theorems, we
   prove a general formula of the optimal dispersal rate in the Wright's
   island model with recurrent mutations. We also show the existence of the
   critical mutation rate, which does not depend on the number of islands
   and below which a positive dispersal rate evolves. Our framework can
   also be applied to lattice or network structured populations. (C) 2012

Title = {The grapheme-valued Wright-Fisher diffusion with mutation},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {158},
Pages = {76-88},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {In Athreya et al. (2021), models from population genetics were used to
   define stochastic dynamics in the space of graphons arising as continuum
   limits of dense graphs. In the present paper we exhibit an example of a
   simple neutral population genetics model for which this dynamics is a
   Markovian diffusion that can be characterized as the solution of a
   martingale problem. In particular, we consider a Markov chain in the
   space of finite graphs that resembles a Moran model with resampling and
   mutation. We encode the finite graphs as graphemes, which can be
   represented as a triple consisting of a vertex set (or more generally, a
   topological space), an adjacency matrix, and a sampling (Borel) measure.
   We equip the space of graphons with convergence of sample subgraph
   densities and show that the grapheme -valued Markov chain converges to a
   grapheme -valued diffusion as the number of vertices goes to infinity.
   We show that the grapheme -valued diffusion has a stationary
   distribution that is linked to the Griffiths-Engen-McCloskey (GEM)
   distribution. In a companion paper (Greven et al. 2023), we build up a
   general theory for obtaining grapheme -valued diffusions via genealogies
   of models in population genetics.},

Title = {Indirect interaction between an endemic and an invading pathogen: A case
   study of<i> Plasmodium</i> and Usutu virus dynamics in a shared bird
   host population},

Abstract = {Infectious disease agents can influence each other's dynamics in shared
   host populations. We consider such influence for two mosquito-borne
   infections where one pathogen is endemic at the time that a second
   pathogen invades. We regard a setting where the vector has a bias
   towards biting host individuals infected with the endemic pathogen and
   where there is a cost to co-infected hosts. As a motivating case study,
   we regard Plasmodium spp., that cause avian malaria, as the endemic
   pathogen, and Usutu virus (USUV) as the invading pathogen. Hosts with
   malaria attract more mosquitoes compared to susceptible hosts, a
   phenomenon named vector bias. The possible trade-off between the
   vector-bias effect and the co-infection mortality is studied using a
   compartmental epidemic model. We focus first on the basic reproduction
   number R0 0 for Usutu virus invading into a malaria-endemic population,
   and then explore the long-term dynamics of both pathogens once Usutu
   virus has become established. We find that the vector bias facilitates
   the introduction of malaria into a susceptible population, as well as
   the introduction of Usutu in a malaria-endemic population. In the long
   term, however, both a vector bias and co-infection mortality lead to a
   decrease in the number of individuals infected with either pathogen,
   suggesting that avian malaria is unlikely to be a promoter of Usutu
   invasion. This proposed approach is general and allows for new insights
   into other negative associations between endemic and invading
   vector-borne pathogens.},

Title = {Evolution of delayed dispersal with group size effect and population
   dynamics},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {157},
Pages = {1-13},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Individuals delay natal dispersal for many reasons. There may be no
   place to disperse to; immediate dispersal or reproduction may be too
   costly; immediate dispersal may mean that the individual and their
   relatives miss the benefits of group living. Understanding the factors
   that lead to the evolution of delayed dispersal is important because
   delayed dispersal sets the stage for complex social groups and social
   behavior. Here, we study the evolution of delayed dispersal when the
   quality of the local environment is improved by greater numbers of
   individuals (e.g., safety in numbers). We assume that individuals who
   delay natal dispersal also expect to delay personal reproduction. In
   addition, we assume that improved environmental quality benefits
   manifest as changes to fecundity and survival. We are interested in how
   do the changes in these life-history features affect delayed dispersal.
   We use a model that ties evolution to population dynamics. We also aim
   to understand the relationship between levels of delayed dispersal and
   the probability of establishing as an independent breeder (a
   population-level feature) in response to changes in life -history
   details. Our model emphasizes kin selection and considers a sexual
   organism, which allows us to study parent-offspring conflict over
   delayed dispersal. At evolutionary equilibrium, fecundity and survival
   benefits of group size or quality promote higher levels of delayed
   dispersal over a larger set of life histories with one exception. The
   exception is for benefits of increased group size or quality reaped by
   the individuals who delay dispersal. There, the increased benefit does
   not change the life histories supporting delay dispersal. Next, in
   contrast to previous predictions, we find that a low probability of
   establishing in a new location is not always associated with a higher
   incidence of delayed dispersal. Finally, we find that increased personal
   benefits of delayed dispersal exacerbate the conflict between parents
   and their offspring. We discuss our findings in relation to previous
   theoretical and empirical work, especially work related to cooperative
   breeding.},

Title = {Large effects and the infinitesimal model},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {156},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The infinitesimal model of quantitative genetics relies on the Central
   Limit Theorem to stipulate that under additive models of quantitative
   traits determined by many loci having similar effect size, the
   difference between an offspring's genetic trait component and the
   average of their two parents' genetic trait components is Normally
   distributed and independent of the parents' values. Here, we investigate
   how the assumption of similar effect sizes affects the model: if,
   alternatively, the tail of the effect size distribution is polynomial
   with exponent alpha < 2 , then a different Central Limit Theorem implies
   that sums of effects should be well-approximated by a ``stable
   distribution{''}, for which single large effects are often still
   important. Empirically, we first find tail exponents between 1 and 2 in
   effect sizes estimated by genome-wide association studies of many human
   disease-related traits. We then show that the independence of offspring
   trait deviations from parental averages in many cases implies the
   Gaussian aspect of the infinitesimal model, suggesting that non-Gaussian
   models of trait evolution must explicitly track the underlying genetics,
   at least for loci of large effect. We also characterize possible
   limiting trait distributions of the infinitesimal model with infinitely
   divisible noise distributions, and compare our results to simulations.},

Title = {On random conformity bias in cultural transmission of polychotomous
   traits},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {156},
Pages = {5-11},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Mathematical models of conformity and anti -conformity have commonly
   included a set of simplifying assumptions. For example, (1) there are m
   = 2 cultural variants in the population, (2) naive individuals observe
   the cultural variants of n = 3 adult ``role models,{''}and (3)
   individuals' levels of conformity or anti -conformity do not change over
   time. Three recent theoretical papers have shown that departures from
   each of these assumptions can produce new population dynamics. Here, we
   explore cases in which multiple, or all, of these assumptions are
   violated simultaneously: namely, in a population with m variants of a
   trait where conformity (or anti -conformity) occurs with respect to n
   role models, we study a model in which the conformity rates at each
   generation are random variables that are independent of the variant
   frequencies at that generation. For this model a class of symmetric
   constant equilibria exist, and it is possible that all of these
   equilibria are simultaneously stochastically locally stable. In such
   cases, the effect of initial conditions on subsequent evolutionary
   trajectories becomes very complicated.},

Pages = {27-38},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Distributional properties of tree shape statistics under random
   phylogenetic tree models play an important role in investigating the
   evolutionary forces underlying the observed phylogenies. In this paper,
   we study two subtree counting statistics, the number of cherries and
   that of pitchforks for the Ford model, the alpha model introduced by
   Daniel Ford. It is a one-parameter family of random phylogenetic tree
   models which includes the proportional to distinguishable arrangement
   (PDA) and the Yule models, two tree models commonly used in
   phylogenetics. Based on a non-uniform version of the extended Polya urn
   models in which negative entries are permitted for their replacement
   matrices, we obtain the strong law of large numbers and the central
   limit theorem for the joint distribution of these two statistics for the
   Ford model. Furthermore, we derive a recursive formula for computing the
   exact joint distribution of these two statistics. This leads to exact
   formulas for their means and higher order asymptotic expansions of their
   second moments, which allows us to identify a critical parameter value
   for the correlation between these two statistics. That is, when the
   number of tree leaves is sufficiently large, they are negatively
   correlated for 0 < alpha < 1/2 and positively correlated for 1/2 < alpha
   < 1. (c) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc. This is an open

Title = {Improving the realism of neutral ecological models by incorporating
   transient dynamics with temporal changes in community size},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {149},
Pages = {12-26},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Neutral models in ecology assume that all species are demographically
   equivalent, such that their abundances differ ultimately because of
   demographic stochasticity rather than selection. In spite of their
   simplicity, neutral models have been found to accurately reproduce
   static patterns of biodiversity for diverse communities. However, the
   same neutral models have been found to exhibit species abundance
   dynamics that are far too slow compared to reality, resulting in poor
   fits to temporally dynamic patterns of biodiversity. Here, we show that
   one of the root causes of these slow dynamics is the additional
   assumption that a community has reached an equilibrium with a fixed
   community size, with species that have a net growth rate close to zero.
   We removed this additional assumption by constructing and analyzing a
   neutral model with an expected community size that can change over time
   and is not necessarily at equilibrium, which thus allows the historical
   formation of a community to be represented explicitly. Our analysis
   demonstrated that for the general scenario where a small community
   rapidly grows in size to a carrying capacity, representing recovery from
   ecological disturbance or assembly of a new community, the model
   produced much larger changes in species abundances and much shorter
   species ages than a neutral model at an equilibrium with fixed community
   size. In addition, the species abundance distribution was biphasic with
   a subset of abundant species arising from a founder effect. We confirmed
   these new results in applications of the new model to the specific
   scenario of recovery of the Amazon tree community after the
   endCretaceous bolide impact, which involved periods of increasing and
   decreasing community size. We conclude that incorporating transient
   dynamics in neutral models improves realism by allowing explicit
   consideration of how a community is formed over realistic
   time-scales.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Analytical Bayesian approach for the design of surveillance and control
   programs to assess pest-eradication success},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {149},
Pages = {1-11},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Large invasive species eradication programs are undertaken to protect
   native biodiversity and agricul-ture. Programs are typically followed by
   a series of surveys to assess the likelihood of eradication success and,
   when residual pests are detected, small-scale control or `mop-ups' are
   implemented to eliminate these infestations. Further surveys follow to
   confirm absence with `freedom' declared when a target probability of
   absence is reached. Such biosecurity programs comprise many interacting
   processes - stochastic biological processes including growth, and
   response and control interventions - and are an important component of
   post-border biosecurity. Statistical frameworks formulated to contribute
   to the design and efficiency of these surveillance and control programs
   are few and, those available, rely on the simulation of the component
   processes. In this paper we formulate an analytical Bayesian framework
   for a general biosecurity program with multiple components to assess
   pest -eradication success. Our model incorporates stochastic growth and
   detection processes, and several pest control mechanisms. Survey results
   and economic considerations are also taken into account to support a
   range of biosecurity management decisions. Using a case study we
   demonstrate that solutions match published simulation results and extend
   the available analysis. Principally, we show how analytical solutions
   can offer a powerful tool to support the design of effective and
   cost-efficient biosecurity systems, and we establish some general
   principles that guide and contribute to robust design.(c) 2022 Elsevier

Title = {Extinction threshold and large population limit of a plant

   component},

Abstract = {We introduce a new model for plant metapopulations with a seed bank
   component, living in a fragmented environment in which local extinction
   events are frequent. This model is an intermediate between population
   dynamics models with a seed bank component, based on the classical
   Wright- Fisher model, and Stochastic Patch Occupancy Models (SPOMs) used
   in metapopulation ecology. Its main feature is the use of ``ghost ``
   individuals, which can reproduce but with a very strong selective
   disadvantage against ``real `` individuals, to artificially ensure a
   constant population size. We show the existence of an extinction
   threshold above which persistence of the subpopulation of ``real ``
   individuals is not possible, and investigate how the seed bank
   characteristics affect this extinction threshold. We also show the
   convergence of the model to a SPOM under an appropriate scaling,
   bridging the gap between individual-based models and occupancy models.

Title = {The effect of human vaccination behaviour on strain competition in an
   infectious disease: An imitation dynamic approach},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {143},
Pages = {62-76},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Strain competition plays an important role in shaping the dynamics of
   multiple pathogen outbreaks in a population. Competition may lead to
   exclusion of some pathogens, while it may influence the invasion of an
   emerging mutant in the population. However, little emphasis has been
   given to understand the influence of human vaccination choice on
   pathogen competition or strain invasion for vaccine-preventable
   infectious diseases. Coupling game dynamic framework of vaccination
   choice and compartmental disease transmission model of two strains, we
   explore invasion and persistence of a mutant in the population despite
   having a lower reproduction rate than the resident one. We illustrate
   that higher perceived strain severity and lower perceived vaccine
   efficacy are necessary conditions for the persistence of a mutant
   strain. The numerical simulation also extends these invasion and
   persistence analyses under asymmetric cross-protective immunity of these
   strains. We show that the dynamics of this cross-immunity model under
   human vaccination choices is determined by the interplay of parameters
   defining the cross-immune response function, perceived risk of
   infection, and vaccine efficacy, and it can exhibit invasion and
   persistence of mutant strain, even complete exclusion of resident strain
   in the regime of sufficiently high perceived risk. We conclude by
   discussing public health implications of the results, that proper risk
   communication in public about the severity of the disease is an
   important task to reduce the chance of mutant invasion. Thus,
   understanding pathogen competitions under social interactions and
   choices may be an important component for policymakers for strategic
   decision-making. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Systematic comparison of coexistence in models of drug-sensitive and
   drug-resistant pathogen strains},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {133},
Pages = {150-158},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {A number of mathematical models have recently been proposed to explain
   empirical trends of pathogen diversity. In particular, long-term
   coexistence of both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant variants of a
   single pathogen is something of a mystery, given that simple models of
   pathogens competing for the same ecological niche predict competitive
   exclusion, and more complex models admitting coexistence require
   assumptions that may not be justified. Coinfection is among the
   candidate mechanisms to generate coexistence, as it occurs in many
   pathogens and provides the opportunity for strains to interact directly.
   Recently, coinfection and competitive release have been described as
   creating a form of negative frequency-dependent selection that promotes
   coexistence, and a range of models containing coinfection have been
   proposed as having generic stable coexistence of multiple strains. This
   abundance of new models presents the challenge of comparison and
   interpretation. To this end, we describe a dimensionless quantity that
   can be used to compare the amount of coexistence generated by different
   models. We focus on models that include coinfection, although this
   framework could be generalized to a larger class of structured models.

Abstract = {Host-parasite interactions in the form of infectious diseases are a
   topic of interest in both evolutionary biology and public health. Both
   fields have relied on mathematical models to predict and understand the
   dynamics and consequences of these interactions. Yet few models
   explicitly incorporate both epidemiological and coevolutionary dynamics,
   allowing for genetic variation in both hosts and parasites. By comparing
   a matching-alleles model of coevolution, a
   susceptible-infected-recovered-susceptible compartmental model from
   epidemiology, and a combined coevolutionary-epidemiology model we assess
   the effect of the coevolutionary feedback on the epidemiological
   dynamics and vice versa. We find that Red-Queen cycles are not robust in
   an epidemiological framework and that coevolutionary interactions can
   alter the conditions under which epidemic cycles arise. Incorporating
   both explicit epidemiology and genetic diversity may have important
   implications for the maintenance of sexual reproduction as well as
   disease management. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {The third moments of the site frequency spectrum},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {120},
Pages = {16-28},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The analysis of patterns of segregating (i.e. polymorphic) sites in
   aligned sequences is routine in population genetics. Quantities of
   interest include the total number of segregating sites and the number of
   sites with mutations of different frequencies, the so-called site
   frequency spectrum. For neutrally evolving sequences, some classical
   results are available, including the expected value and variance of the
   spectrum in the Kingman coalescent model without recombination as
   calculated by Fu (1995).
   In this work, we use similar techniques to compute the third moments of
   the frequencies of three linked sites. Based on these results, we derive
   analytical results for the bias of Tajima's D and other neutrality
   tests.
   As a corollary, we obtain the second moments of the frequencies of two
   linked mutations conditional on the presence of a third mutation with a
   certain frequency. These moments can be used for the normalisation of
   new neutrality tests relying on these spectra. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Title = {The evolution of toxicant resistance in daphniids and its role on
   surrogate species},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {119},
Pages = {15-25},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Prolonged exposure to a disturbance such as a toxicant has the potential
   to result in rapid evolution to toxicant resistance in many short-lived
   species such as daphniids. This evolution may allow a population to
   persist at higher levels of the toxicant than is possible without
   evolution. Here we apply evolutionary game theory to a Leslie matrix
   model for a daphniid population to obtain a Darwinian model that couples
   population dynamics with the dynamics of an evolving trait. We use the
   Darwinian model to consider how the evolution of resistance to the
   lethal or sublethal effects of a disturbance may change the population
   dynamics. In particular, we determine the conditions under which a
   daphniid population can persist by evolving toxicant resistance. We then
   consider the implications of this evolution in terms of the use of
   daphniids as surrogate species. We show for three species of daphniids
   that evolution of toxicant resistance means that one species may persist
   while another does not. These results suggest that toxicant studies that
   do not consider the potential of a species (or its surrogate) to develop
   toxicant resistance may not accurately predict the long term persistence
   of the species. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Two-locus clines on the real line with a step environment},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {117},
Pages = {1-22},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The shape of allele-frequency dines maintained by migration-selection
   balance depends not only on the properties of migration and selection,
   but also on the dominance relations among alleles and on linkage to
   other loci under selection. We investigate a two-locus model in which
   two diallelic, recombining loci are subject to selection caused by an
   abrupt environmental change. The habitat is one-dimensional and
   unbounded, selection at each locus is modeled by step functions such
   that in one region one allele at each locus is advantageous and in the
   other deleterious. We admit an environmentally independent, intermediate
   degree of dominance at both loci, including complete dominance. First,
   we derive an explicit expression for the single-locus dine with
   dominance, thus generalizing classical results by Haldane (1948). We
   show that the slope of the dine in the center (at the step) or,
   equivalently, the width of the dine, is independent of the degree of
   dominance. Second, under the assumption of strong recombination relative
   to selection and migration, the first-order approximations of the
   allele-frequency dines at each of the loci and of the linkage
   disequilibrium are derived. This may be interpreted as the quasi-linkage
   equilibrium approximation of the two-locus dine. Explicit asymptotic
   expressions for the dines are deduced as x -> +/-infinity. For
   equivalent loci, explicit expressions for the whole dines are derived.
   The influence of dominance and of linkage on the slope of the dine in
   the center and on a global measure of steepness are investigated. This
   global measure reflects the influence of dominance. Finally, the
   accuracy of the approximations and the dependence of the shape of the
   two-locus dine on the full range of recombination rates is explored by
   numerical integration of the underlying system of partial differential
   equations. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Invasion fitness for gene-culture co-evolution in family-structured
   populations and an application to cumulative culture under vertical
   transmission},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},

Abstract = {Human evolution depends on the co-evolution between genetically
   determined behaviors and socially transmitted information. Although
   vertical transmission of cultural information from parent to offspring
   is common in hominins, its effects on cumulative cultural evolution are
   not fully understood. Here, we investigate gene-culture co-evolution in
   a family-structured population by studying the invasion fitness of a
   mutant allele that influences a deterministic level of cultural
   information (e.g., amount of knowledge or skill) to which diploid
   carriers of the mutant are exposed in subsequent generations. We show
   that the selection gradient on such a mutant, and the concomitant level
   of cultural information it generates, can be evaluated analytically
   under the assumption that the cultural dynamic has a single attractor
   point, thereby making gene-culture co-evolution in family-structured
   populations with multi generational effects mathematically tractable. We
   apply our result to study how genetically determined phenotypes of
   individual and social learning co-evolve with the level of adaptive
   information they generate under vertical transmission. We find that
   vertical transmission increases adaptive information due to kin
   selection effects, but when information is transmitted as efficiently
   between family members as between unrelated individuals, this increase
   is moderate in diploids. By contrast, we show that the way resource
   allocation into learning trades off with allocation into reproduction
   (the ``learning-reproduction trade-off{''}) significantly influences
   levels of adaptive information. We also show that vertical transmission
   prevents evolutionary branching and may therefore play a qualitative
   role in gene-culture co-evolutionary dynamics. More generally, our
   analysis of selection suggests that vertical transmission can
   significantly increase levels of adaptive information under the
   biologically plausible condition that information transmission between
   relatives is more efficient than between unrelated individuals. (C) 2017

Title = {Eigenanalysis of SNP data with an identity by descent interpretation},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {107},
Number = {SI},
Pages = {65-76},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Principal component analysis (PCA) is widely used in genome-wide
   association studies (GWAS), and the principal component axes often
   represent perpendicular gradients in geographic space. The explanation
   of PCA results is of major interest for geneticists to understand
   fundamental demographic parameters. Here, we provide an interpretation
   of PCA based on relatedness measures, which are described by the
   probability that sets of genes are identical-by-descent (IBD). An
   approximately linear transformation between ancestral proportions (AP)
   of individuals with multiple ancestries and their projections onto the
   principal components is found.
   In addition, a new method of eigenanalysis ``EIGMIX{''} is proposed to
   estimate individual ancestries. EIGMIX is a method of moments with
   computational efficiency suitable for millions of SNP data, and it is
   not subject to the assumption of linkage equilibrium. With the
   assumptions of multiple ancestries and their surrogate ancestral
   samples, EIGMIX is able to infer ancestral proportions (APs) of
   individuals. The methods were applied to the SNP data from the HapMap
   Phase 3 project and the Human Genome Diversity Panel. The APs of
   individuals inferred by EIGMIX are consistent with the findings of the
   program ADMIXTURE.
   In conclusion, EIGMIX can be used to detect population structure and
   estimate genome-wide ancestral proportions with a relatively high
   accuracy. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.},

Title = {Inference of directional selection and mutation parameters assuming
   equilibrium},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {106},
Pages = {71-82},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In a classical study, Wright (1931) proposed a model for the evolution
   of a biallelic locus under the influence of mutation, directional
   selection and drift. He derived the equilibrium distribution of the
   allelic proportion conditional on the scaled mutation rate, the mutation
   bias and the scaled strength of directional selection. The equilibrium
   distribution can be used for inference of these parameters with
   genome-wide datasets of ``site frequency spectra{''} (SFS). Assuming
   that the scaled mutation rate is low, Wright's model can be approximated
   by a boundary-mutation model, where mutations are introduced into the
   population exclusively from sites fixed for the preferred or unpreferred
   allelic states. With the boundary-mutation model, inference can be
   partitioned: (i) the shape of the SFS distribution within the
   polymorphic region is determined by random drift and directional
   selection, but not by the mutation parameters, such that inference of
   the selection parameter relies exclusively on the polymorphic sites in
   the SFS; (ii) the mutation parameters can be inferred from the amount of
   polymorphic and monomorphic preferred and unpreferred alleles,
   conditional on the selection parameter. Herein, we derive maximum
   likelihood estimators for the mutation and selection parameters in
   equilibrium and apply the method to simulated SFS data as well as
   empirical data from a Madagascar population of Drosophila simulans. (C)

Volume = {105},

Abstract = {Model predictions for species competition outcomes highly depend on the
   assumed form of the population growth function. In this paper we apply
   an alternative inferential method based on statistical mechanics,
   maximizing Boltzmann entropy, to predict resource-constrained population
   dynamics and coexistence. Within this framework, population dynamics and
   competition outcome can be determined without assuming any particular
   form of the population growth function. The dynamics of each species is
   determined by two parameters: the mean resource requirement theta
   (related to the mean metabolic rate) and individual distinguishability
   D-r (related to intra- compared to interspecific functional variation).
   Our theory clarifies the condition for the energetic equivalence rule
   (EER) to hold, and provide a statistical explanation for the importance
   of species functional variation in determining population dynamics and
   coexistence patterns. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Likelihood-based tree reconstruction on a concatenation of aligned
   sequence data sets can be statistically inconsistent},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {100},
Pages = {56-62},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The reconstruction of a species tree from genomic data faces a double
   hurdle. First, the (gene) tree describing the evolution of each gene may
   differ from the species tree, for instance, due to incomplete lineage
   sorting. Second, the aligned genetic sequences at the leaves of each
   gene tree provide merely an imperfect estimate of the topology of the
   gene tree. In this note, we demonstrate formally that a basic
   statistical problem arises if one tries to avoid accounting for these
   two processes and analyses the genetic data directly via a concatenation
   approach. More precisely, we show that, under the multispecies
   coalescent with a standard site substitution model, maximum likelihood
   estimation on sequence data that has been concatenated across genes and
   performed under the incorrect assumption that all sites have evolved
   independently and identically on a fixed tree is a statistically
   inconsistent estimator of the species tree. Our results provide a formal
   justification of simulation results described of Kubatko and Degnan
   (2007) and others, and complements recent theoretical results by
   DeGlorgio and Degnan (2010) and Chifman and Kubtako (2014). (C) 2014

Title = {Clines in quantitative traits: The role of migration patterns and
   selection scenarios},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {99},
Pages = {43-66},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The existence, uniqueness, and shape of dines in a quantitative trait
   under selection toward a spatially varying optimum is studied. The focus
   is on deterministic diploid two-locus n-deme models subject to various
   migration patterns and selection scenarios. Migration patterns may
   exhibit isolation by distance, as in the stepping-stone model, or random
   dispersal, as in the island model. The phenotypic optimum may change
   abruptly in a single environmental step, more gradually, or not at all.
   Symmetry assumptions are imposed on phenotypic optima and migration
   rates. We study dines in the mean, variance, and linkage disequilibrium
   (LD). Clines result from polymorphic equilibria. The possible
   equilibrium configurations are determined as functions of the migration
   rate. Whereas for weak migration, many polymorphic equilibria may be
   simultaneously stable, their number decreases with increasing migration
   rate. Also for intermediate migration rates polymorphic equilibria are
   in general not unique, however, for loci of equal effects the
   corresponding dines in the mean, variance, and LD are unique. For
   sufficiently strong migration, no polymorphism is maintained. Both
   migration pattern and selection scenario exert strong influence on the
   existence and shape of dines. The results for discrete demes are
   compared with those from models in which space varies continuously and
   dispersal is modeled by diffusion. Comparisons with previous studies,
   which investigated dines under neutrality or under linkage equilibrium,
   are performed. If there is no long-distance migration, the environment
   does not change abruptly, and linkage is not very tight, populations are
   almost everywhere close to linkage equilibrium. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Title = {Equilibrium population dynamics when mating is by mutual choice based on
   age},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {94},
Pages = {63-72},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {We consider a steady state model of mutual mate choice in which an
   individual's mate preferences depend on his/her age, and the preferences
   are over the ages of prospective mates of the opposite sex. We present a
   discrete time (and age) model corresponding to successive mating
   seasons. Males are fertile for m periods (corresponding to `age' i = 1
   to m) and females for n <= m periods (they have ages j = 1 to n), which
   is all that distinguishes the sexes. Although we can deal with arbitrary
   preferences, we concentrate on a simple fertility model where the common
   utility to a male age i and female age j who mate is the number K =
   min(m i - 1, n - j + 1) of future periods of joint fertility. The
   incoming sex ratio R of age 1 males to age 1 females is given
   exogenously. In each period individuals are randomly (non assortatively)
   matched and form a mated couple by mutual consent; otherwise they go
   into the next period unmated and older. We derive properties of
   equilibrium threshold acceptance strategies and establish the existence
   of time-invariant age distributions. Our methods determine the age
   distribution of couples at marriage (mating) and the population sex
   ratio (OSR) at equilibrium. Since this can be determined empirically in
   a population, our model can be used to rule out most systems of age
   preferences (those not consistent with the observed distribution). This
   extends earlier models of mutual choice with one dimensional types of
   Alpern and Reyniers {[}1999. Strategic mating with homotypic
   preferences. J. Theor. Biol. 198, 71-88; 2005. Strategic mating with
   common preferences. J. Theor. Biol. 237,337-354] where individuals
   sought, respectively, individuals with similar or high types, but in
   those models an individual's type was fixed over time.
   Under the simple fertility model, at equilibrium the maximum age of an
   acceptable partner is increasing in the age of the searcher. Our results
   relate to discussions in the literature regarding optimal parental age
   differences, age-related mate preferences, and to mate choice in
   general. We believe our model will be used as a tool in future
   investigations in these areas. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {Species ages in neutral biodiversity models},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {93},
Pages = {85-94},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Biogeography seeks to understand the mechanisms that drive biodiversity
   across long temporal and large spatial scales. Theoretical models of
   biogeography can be tested by comparing their predictions of quantities
   such as species ages against empirical estimates. It has previously been
   claimed that the neutral theory of biodiversity and biogeography
   predicts species ages that are unrealistically long. Any improved theory
   of biodiversity must rectify this problem, but first it is necessary to
   quantify the problem precisely. Here we provide analytical expressions
   for species ages in neutral biodiversity communities. We analyse a
   spatially implicit metacommunity model and solve for both the zero-sum
   and non-zero-sum cases. We explain why our new expressions are, in the
   context of biodiversity, usually more appropriate than those previously
   imported from neutral molecular evolution. Because of the time symmetry
   of the spatially implicit neutral model, our expressions also lead
   directly to formulas for species persistence times and species
   lifetimes. We use our new expressions to estimate species ages of forest
   trees under a neutral model and find that they are about an order of
   magnitude shorter than those predicted previously but still
   unrealistically long. In light of our results, we discuss different
   models of biogeography that may solve the problem of species ages. (C)

Title = {Coevolution of intelligence, behavioral repertoire, and lifespan},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {91},
Pages = {44-49},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Across many taxa, intriguing positive correlations exist between
   intelligence (measured by proxy as encephalization), behavioral
   repertoire size, and lifespan. Here we argue, through a simple
   theoretical model, that such correlations arise from selection pressures
   for efficient learning of behavior sequences. We define intelligence
   operationally as the ability to disregard unrewarding behavior
   sequences, without trying them out, in the search for rewarding
   sequences. We show that increasing a species' behavioral repertoire
   increases the number of rewarding behavior sequences that can be
   performed, but also the time required to learn such sequences. This
   trade-off results in an optimal repertoire size that decreases rapidly
   with increasing sequence length. Behavioral repertoire size can be
   increased by increasing intelligence or lengthening the lifespan, giving
   rise to the observed correlations between these traits. (C) 2013

Title = {Evolution of learning and levels of selection: A lesson from avian
   parent-offspring communication},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {91},
Pages = {58-74},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In recent years, it has become increasingly clear that the evolution of
   behavior may be better understood as the evolution of the learning
   mechanisms that produce it, and that such mechanisms should be modeled
   and tested explicitly. However, this approach, which has recently been
   applied to animal foraging and decision-making, has rarely been applied
   to the social and communicative behaviors that are likely to operate in
   complex social environments and be subject to multi-level selection.
   Here we use genetic, agent-based evolutionary simulations to explore how
   learning mechanisms may evolve to adjust the level of nestling begging
   (offspring signaling of need), and to examine the possible consequences
   of this process for parent offspring conflict and communication. In
   doing so, we also provide the first step-by-step dynamic model of parent
   offspring communication. The results confirm several previous
   theoretical predictions and demonstrate three novel phenomena. First,
   negatively frequency-dependent group-level selection can generate a
   stable polymorphism of learning strategies and parental responses.
   Second, while conventional reinforcement learning models fail to cope
   successfully with family dynamics at the nest, a newly developed
   learning model (incorporating behaviors that are consistent with recent
   experimental results on learning in nestling begging) produced effective
   learning, which evolved successfully. Third, while kin-selection affects
   the frequency of the different learning genes, its impact on begging
   slope and intensity was unexpectedly negligible, demonstrating that
   evolution is a complex process, and showing that the effect of
   kin-selection on behaviors that are shaped by learning may not be
   predicted by simple application of Hamilton's rule. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Title = {Patterns of spawning and settlement of reef fishes as strategic
   responses to post-settlement competition},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {160},
Pages = {1-13},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Settlement is a critical transition in the life history of reef fish,
   and the timing of this event can have a strong effect on fitness. Key
   factors that influence settlement timing are predictable lunar cyclic
   variation in tidal currents, moonlight, and nocturnal predation risk as
   larvae transition from pelagic to benthic environments. However,
   populations typically display wide variation in the arrival of settlers
   over the lunar cycle. This variation is often hypothesized to result
   from unpredictable conditions in the pelagic environment and bet-hedging
   by spawning adults. Here, we consider the hypothesis that the timing of
   spawning and settlement is a strategic response to post-settlement
   competition. We use a game theoretic model to predict spawning and
   settlement distributions when fish face a tradeoff between minimizing
   density-independent predation risk while crossing the reef crest vs.
   avoiding high competitor density on settlement habitat. In general, we
   expect competition to spread spawning over time such that settlement is
   distributed around the lunar phase with the lowest predation risk,
   similar to an ideal free distribution in which competition spreads
   competitors across space. We examine the effects of overcompensating
   density dependence, age-dependent competition, and competition among
   daily settler cohorts. Our model predicts that even in the absence of
   stochastic variation in the larval environment, competition can result
   in qualitative divergence between spawning and settlement distributions.
   Furthermore, we show that if competitive strength increases with settler
   age, competition results in covariation between settler age and
   settlement date, with older larvae settling when predation risk is
   minimal. We predict that competition between daily cohorts delays peak
   settlement, with priority effects potentially selecting for a multimodal
   settlement distribution.},

Title = {Spatial invasion of cooperative parasites},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {159},
Pages = {35-58},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In this paper we study invasion probabilities and invasion times of
   cooperative parasites spreading in spatially structured host
   populations. The spatial structure of the host population is given by a
   random geometric graph on {[}0,1](n), n is an element of N, with a
   Poisson(N)-distributed number of vertices and in which vertices are
   connected over an edge when they have a distance of at most r(N) with
   r(N) of order N(beta-1)/n for some 0 < beta < 1. At a host infection
   many parasites are generated and parasites move along edges to
   neighbouring hosts. We assume that parasites have to cooperate to infect
   hosts, in the sense that at least two parasites need to attack a host
   simultaneously. We find lower and upper bounds on the invasion
   probability of the parasites in terms of survival probabilities of
   branching processes with cooperation. Furthermore, we characterize the
   asymptotic invasion time. An important ingredient of the proofs is a
   comparison with infection dynamics of cooperative parasites in host
   populations structured according to a complete graph, i.e. in well-mixed
   host populations. For these infection processes we can show that
   invasion probabilities are asymptotically equal to survival
   probabilities of branching processes with cooperation. Furthermore, we
   build on proof techniques developed in Brouard and Pokalyuk (2022),
   where an analogous invasion process has been studied for host
   populations structured according to a configuration model. We
   substantiate our results with simulations.},

Title = {The optimal momentum of population growth and decline},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {155},
Pages = {51-66},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {About 50 years ago, Keyfitz (1971) asked how much further a growing
   human population would increase if its fertility rate were immediately
   to be reduced to replacement level and remain there forever. The reason
   for demographic momentum is an age-structure inertia due to relatively
   many potential parents because of past high fertility. Although nobody
   expects such a miraculous reduction in reproductive behavior, a gradual
   decline in fertility in rapidly growing populations seems inevitable. As
   any delay in fertility decline to a stationary level leads to an
   increase in the momentum, it makes sense to think about the timing and
   the quantum of the reduction in reproduction. More specifically, we
   consider an intertemporal trade-off between costly pro-and
   anti-natalistic measures and the demographic momentum at the end of the
   planning period. This paper uses the McKendrick-von Foerster partial
   differential equation of age-structured population dynamics to study a
   sketched problem in a distributed parameter control framework. Among the
   results obtained by applying an appropriate extension of Pontryagin's
   Maximum Principle are the following: (i) monotony of adaptation efforts
   to net reproduction rate and convex decrease/concave increase (if
   initial net reproduction rate exceeds 1/is below 1); and (ii)
   oscillating efforts and reproduction rate if, additionally, the size of
   the total population does not deviate from a fixed level.},

Title = {Taylor's law for exponentially growing local populations linked by

Abstract = {We consider the dynamics of a collection of n > 1 populations in which
   each population has its own rate of growth or decay, fixed in continuous
   time, and migrants may flow from one population to another over a fixed
   network, at a rate, fixed over time, times the size of the sending
   population. This model is represented by an ordinary linear differential
   equation of dimension n with constant coefficients arrayed in an
   essentially nonnegative matrix. This paper identifies conditions on the
   parameters of the model (specifically, conditions on the eigenvalues and
   eigenvectors) under which the variance of the n population sizes at a
   given time is asymptotically (as time increases) proportional to a power
   of the mean of the population sizes at that given time. A power-law
   variance function is known in ecology as Taylor's Law and in physics as
   fluctuation scaling. Among other results, we show that Taylor's Law
   holds asymptotically, with variance asymptotically proportional to the
   mean squared, on an open dense subset of the class of models considered
   here.},

Title = {Estimating the Lambda measure in multiple-merger coalescents},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {154},
Pages = {94-101},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Multiple-merger coalescents, also known as A-coalescents, have been used
   to describe the genealogy of popu lations that have a skewed offspring
   distribution or that undergo strong selection. Inferring the
   characteristic measure A, which describes the rates of the
   multiple-merger events, is key to understand these processes. So far,
   most inference methods only work for some particular families of A
   coalescents that are described by only one parameter, but not for more
   general models. This article is devoted to the construction of a
   non-parametric estimator of the density of A that is based on the
   observation at a single time of the so-called Site Frequency Spectrum
   (SPS), which describes the allelic frequencies in a present population
   sample. First, we produce estimates of the multiple-merger rates by
   solving a linear system, whose coefficients are obtained by
   appropriately subsampling the SFS. Then, we use a technique that
   aggregates the information extracted from the previous step through a
   kernel type of re construction to give a non parametric estimation of
   the measure A. We give a consistency result of this estimator under mild
   conditions on the behavior of A around 0. We also show some numerical
   examples of how our method performs,},

Title = {Inference of gene flow in the process of speciation: Efficient
   maximum-likelihood implementation of a generalised
   isolation-with-migration model},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {140},
Pages = {1-15},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The `isolation with migration' (IM) model has been extensively used in
   the literature to detect gene flow during the process of speciation. In
   this model, an ancestral population split into two or more descendant
   populations which subsequently exchanged migrants at a constant rate
   until the present. Of course, the assumption of constant gene flow until
   the present is often over-simplistic in the context of speciation. In
   this paper, we consider a `generalised IM' (GIM) model: a two-population
   IM model in which migration rates and population sizes are allowed to
   change at some point in the past. By developing a maximum-likelihood
   implementation of this model, we enable inference on both historical and
   contemporary rates of gene flow between two closely related populations
   or species. The GIM model encompasses both the standard two-population
   IM model and the `isolation with initial migration' (IIM) model as
   special cases, as well as a model of secondary contact. We examine for
   simulated data how our method can be used, by means of likelihood ratio
   tests or AIC scores, to distinguish between the following scenarios of
   population divergence: (a) divergence in complete isolation; (b)
   divergence with a period of gene flow followed by isolation; (c)
   divergence with a period of isolation followed by secondary contact; (d)
   divergence with ongoing gene flow. Our method is based on the coalescent
   and is suitable for data sets consisting of the number of nucleotide
   differences between one pair of DNA sequences at each of a large number
   of independent loci. As our method relies on an explicit expression for
   the likelihood, it is computationally very fast. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Title = {Allele frequency spectra in structured populations: Novel-allele
   probabilities under the labelled coalescent},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {133},
Pages = {130-140},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {We address the effect of population structure on key properties of the
   Ewens sampling formula. We use our previously-introduced inductive
   method for determining exact allele frequency spectrum (AFS)
   probabilities under the infinite-allele model of mutation and population
   structure for samples of arbitrary size. Fundamental to the sampling
   distribution is the novel-allele probability, the probability that given
   the pattern of variation in the present sample, the next gene sampled
   belongs to an as-yet-unobserved allelic class. Unlike the case for
   panmictic populations, the novel-allele probability depends on the AFS
   of the present sample. We derive a recursion that directly provides the
   marginal novel-allele probability across AFSs, obviating the need first
   to determine the probability of each AFS. Our explorations suggest that
   the marginal novel-allele probability tends to be greater for initial
   samples comprising fewer alleles and for sampling configurations in
   which the next-observed gene derives from a deme different from that of
   the majority of the present sample. Comparison to the efficient
   importance sampling proposals developed by De Iorio and Griffiths and
   colleagues indicates that their approximation for the novel-allele
   probability generally agrees with the true marginal, although it may
   tend to overestimate the marginal in cases in which the novel-allele
   probability is high and migration rates are low. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Title = {Influence of demographically-realistic mortality schedules on
   vaccination strategies in age-structured models},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {132},
Pages = {24-32},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Because demographic realism complicates analysis, mathematical modelers
   either ignore demography or make simplifying assumptions (e.g., births
   and deaths equal). But human populations differ demographically, perhaps
   most notably in their mortality schedules. We developed an
   age-stratified population model with births, deaths, aging and mixing
   between age groups. The model includes types I and II mortality as
   special cases. We used the gradient approach (Feng et al., 2015, 2017)
   to explore the impact of mortality patterns on optimal strategies for
   mitigating vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles and rubella,
   which the international community has targeted for eradication.
   Identification of optimal vaccine allocations to reduce the effective
   reproduction number under various scenarios is presented. Numerical
   simulations of the model with various types of mortality are carried out
   to ascertain the long-term effects of vaccination on disease incidence.
   We conclude that both optimal vaccination strategies and long-term
   effects of vaccination may depend on demographic assumptions. Published

Abstract = {Whole genome epistasis models with interactions between different loci
   can be approximated by genomic relationship models based on Hadamard
   powers of the additive genomic relationship. We illustrate that the
   quality of this approximation reduces when the degree of interaction d
   increases. Moreover, considering relationship models defined as weighted
   sum of interactions of different degree, we investigate the impact of
   this decreasing quality of approximation of the summands on the
   approximation of the weighted sum. Our results indicate that these
   approximations remain on a reliable level, but their quality reduces
   when the weights of interactions of higher degrees do not decrease
   quickly. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.},

Title = {Establishment in a new habitat by polygenic adaptation},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {122},
Number = {SI},
Pages = {110-127},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Maladapted individuals can only colonise a new habitat if they can
   evolve a positive growth rate fast enough to avoid extinction, a process
   known as evolutionary rescue. We treat log fitness at low density in the
   new habitat as a single polygenic trait and use the infinitesimal model
   to follow the evolution of the growth rate; this assumes that the trait
   values of offspring of a sexual union are normally distributed around
   the mean of the parents' trait values, with variance that depends only
   on the parents' relatedness. The probability that a single migrant can
   establish depends on just two parameters: the mean and genetic variance
   of the trait in the source population. The chance of success becomes
   small if migrants come from a population with mean growth rate in the
   new habitat more than a few standard deviations below zero; this chance
   depends roughly equally on the probability that the initial founder is
   unusually fit, and on the subsequent increase in growth rate of its
   offspring as a result of selection. The loss of genetic variation during
   the founding event is substantial, but highly variable. With continued
   migration at rate M, establishment is inevitable; when migration is
   rare, the expected time to establishment decreases inversely with M.
   However, above a threshold migration rate, the population may be trapped
   in a `sink' state, in which adaptation is held back by gene flow; above
   this threshold, the expected time to establishment increases
   exponentially with M. This threshold behaviour is captured by a
   deterministic approximation, which assumes a Gaussian distribution of
   the trait in the founder population with mean and variance evolving
   deterministically. By assuming a constant genetic variance, we also
   develop a diffusion approximation for the joint distribution of
   population size and trait mean, which extends to include stabilising
   selection and density regulation. Divergence of the population from its
   ancestors causes partial reproductive isolation, which we measure
   through the reproductive value of migrants into the newly established
   population. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Volume = {119},
Pages = {48-56},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {We consider a model of viability selection in a highly fecund haploid
   population with sweepstakes reproduction. We use simulations to estimate
   the time until the allelic type with highest fitness has reached high
   frequency in a finite population. We compare the time between two
   reproduction modes of high and low fecundity. We also consider the
   probability that the allelic type with highest fitness is lost from the
   population before reaching high frequency. Our simulation results
   indicate that highly fecund populations can evolve faster (in some cases
   much faster) than populations of low fecundity. However, high fecundity
   and sweepstakes reproduction also confer much higher risk of losing the
   allelic type with highest fitness from the population by chance. The
   impact of selection on driving alleles to high frequency varies
   depending on the trait value conferring highest fitness; in some cases
   the effect of selection can hardly be detected. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

   local density dependence},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {109},
Pages = {6-15},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Identifying the steady states of a population is a key issue in
   theoretical ecology, that includes the study of spatially heterogeneous
   populations. There are several examples of real ecosystems in patchy
   environments where the habitats are heterogeneous in their local density
   dependence. We investigate a multi-patch model of a single species with
   spatial dispersal, where the growth of the local population is logistic
   in some localities (negative density dependence) while other patches
   exhibit a strong Allee effect (positive density dependence). When the
   local dynamics is logistic in each patch and the habitats are
   interconnected by dispersal then the total population has only the
   extinction steady state and a componentwise positive equilibrium,
   corresponding to persistence in each patch. We show that animal
   populations in patchy environments can have a large number of steady
   states if local density dependence varies over the locations. It is
   demonstrated that, depending on the network topology of migration routes
   between the patches, the interaction of spatial dispersal and local
   density dependence can create a variety of coexisting stable positive
   equilibria. We give a detailed description of the multiple ways
   dispersal can rescue local populations from extinction. (C) 2016

Volume = {109},
Pages = {28-43},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In geographically structured populations, partial global panmixia can be
   regarded as the limiting case of long-distance migration. In the
   presence of a geographical barrier, an exact, discrete model for the
   evolution of the gene frequencies at a multiallelic locus under
   viability selection, local adult migration, and partial panmixia is
   formulated. For slow evolution, from this model a spatially
   unidimensional continuous approximation (a system of integro-partial
   differential equations with discontinuities at the barrier) is derived.
   For (i) the step-environment, (ii) homogeneous, isotropic migration on
   the entire line, and (iii) two alleles without dominance, an explicit
   solution for the unique polymorphic equilibrium is found. In most
   natural limiting cases, asymptotic expressions are obtained for the gene
   frequencies on either side of the barrier. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All

Title = {The relative importance of relative nonlinearity and the storage effect
   in the lottery model},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {105},
Pages = {39-52},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Although it is likely that many coexistence mechanisms contribute to
   maintenance of species diversity, most approaches to understanding
   species coexistence proceed as if only one mechanism would be present.
   In studies of species coexistence in a temporally fluctuating
   environment, the storage effect, believed to be the most important
   coexistence mechanism, has been the focus. Although a different
   coexistence mechanism-relative nonlinearity-is also predicted to arise
   frequently with environmental variation, its effect has been
   overshadowed by the storage effect. The relatively nonlinear growth
   rates on which the mechanism depends arise simply from differences in
   life history traits. Many kinds of temporal variation can then interact
   with these nonlinearity differences to create the relative nonlinearity
   coexistence mechanism. Much is unknown about when this mechanism is
   important and its total neglect is not justified. Here, we use the
   lottery model to provide a much needed quantitative assessment of the
   relative and combined effects of relative nonlinearity and the storage
   effect. Our analysis takes advantage of recently developed techniques
   for quantifying coexistence mechanisms when multiple mechanisms operate
   in concert. We find that relative nonlinearity is able to contribute
   substantially to species coexistence in the lottery model when two
   conditions are satisfied: (1) species must differ greatly in their adult
   death rates, (2) sensitivity of recruitment to environmental variation
   must be greater for species with larger adult death rates. In addition,
   relative nonlinearity has a critical role in compensating for a weakened
   storage effect when there is high correlation between species in their
   responses to the varying environment. In some circumstances relative
   nonlinearity is stronger than the storage effect or is even the sole
   mechanism of coexistence. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Tuberculosis (TB) is a leading cause of human mortality due to
   infectious disease. Treatment default is a relevant factor which reduces
   therapeutic success and increases the risk of resistant TB. In this work
   we analyze the relation between treatment default and treatment length
   along with its consequence on the disease spreading. We use a stylized
   model structure to explore, systematically, the effects of varying
   treatment duration and compliance. We find that shortening treatment
   alone may not reduce TB prevalence, especially in regions where
   transmission intensity is high, indicating the necessity of
   complementing this action with increased compliance. A family of default
   functions relating the proportion of defaulters to the treatment length
   is considered and adjusted to a particular dataset. We find that the
   epidemiological benefits of shorter treatment regimens are tightly
   associated with increases in treatment compliance and depend on the
   epidemiological background. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Enhancing the mathematical properties of new haplotype homozygosity
   statistics for the detection of selective sweeps},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {102},
Pages = {94-101},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Soft selective sweeps represent an important form of adaptation in which
   multiple haplotypes bearing adaptive alleles rise to high frequency.
   Most statistical methods for detecting selective sweeps from genetic
   polymorphism data, however, have focused on identifying hard selective
   sweeps in which a favored allele appears on a single haplotypic
   background; these methods might be underpowered to detect soft sweeps.
   Among exceptions is the set of haplotype homozygosity statistics
   introduced for the detection of soft sweeps by Garud et al. (2015).
   These statistics, examining frequencies of multiple haplotypes in
   relation to each other, include H-12, a statistic designed to identify
   both hard and soft selective sweeps, and H-2/H-1, a statistic that
   conditional on high H-12 values seeks to distinguish between hard and
   soft sweeps. A challenge in the use of H-2/H-1 is that its range depends
   on the associated value of H-12, so that equal H-2/H-1 values might
   provide different levels of support for a soft sweep model at different
   values of H-12. Here, we enhance the H-12 and H-2/H-1 haplotype
   homozygosity statistics for selective sweep detection by deriving the
   upper bound on H-2/H-1 as a function of H-12, thereby generating a
   statistic that normalizes H-2/H-1 to lie between 0 and 1. Through a
   reanalysis of resequencing data from inbred lines of Drosophila, we show
   that the enhanced statistic both strengthens interpretations obtained
   with the unnormalized statistic and leads to empirical insights that are
   less readily apparent without the normalization. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Title = {The site frequency spectrum of dispensable genes},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {100},
Pages = {13-25},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The differences between DNA-sequences within a population are the basis
   to infer the ancestral relationship of the individuals. Within the
   classical infinitely many sites model, it is possible to estimate the
   mutation rate based on the site frequency spectrum, which is comprised
   by the numbers C-1,...,Cn-1 where n is the sample size and C-s is the
   number of site mutations (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms, SNPs) which
   are seen in s genomes. Classical results can be used to compare the
   observed site frequency spectrum with its neutral expectation, E{[}C-s]
   = theta(2)/s, where theta(2) is the scaled site mutation rate. In this
   paper, we will relax the assumption of the infinitely many sites model
   that all individuals only carry homologous genetic material. Especially,
   it is today well-known that bacterial genomes have the ability to gain
   and lose genes, such that every single genome is a mosaic of genes, and
   genes are present and absent in a random fashion, giving rise to the
   dispensable genome. While this presence and absence has been modeled
   under neutral evolution within the infinitely many genes model in
   Baumdicker et al. (2010), we link presence and absence of genes with the
   numbers of site mutations seen within each gene. In this work we derive
   a formula for the expectation of the joint gene and site frequency
   spectrum, denoted by G(k,s), the number of mutated sites occurring in
   exactly s gene sequences, while the corresponding gene is present in
   exactly k individuals. We show that standard estimators of theta(2) for
   dispensable genes are biased and that the site frequency spectrum for
   dispensable genes differs from the classical result. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Title = {Covariation of gene frequencies in a stepping-stone lattice of
   populations},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {100},
Pages = {88-97},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {For a one- or two-dimensional lattice of finite length consisting of
   populations, each of which has the same population size, the classical
   stepping-stone model has been used to approximate the patterns of
   variation at neutral loci in geographic regions. In the pioneering
   papers by Maruyama (1970a, 1970b, 1971) the changes of gene frequency at
   a locus subject to neutral mutation between two alleles, migration, and
   random genetic drift were modeled by a vector autoregression model.
   Maruyama was able to use the spectrum of the migration matrix, but to do
   this he had to introduce approximations in which there was either extra
   mutation in the terminal populations, or extra migration from the
   subterminal population into the terminal population. In this paper a
   similar vector autoregression model is used, but it proves possible to
   obtain the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the migration matrix without
   those approximations. Approximate formulas for the variances and
   covariances of gene frequencies in different populations are obtained,
   and checked by numerical iteration of the exact covariances of the
   vector autoregression model. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The coalescent with recombination process has initially been formulated
   backwards in time, but simulation algorithms and inference procedures
   often apply along sequences. Therefore it is of major interest to
   approximate the coalescent with recombination process by a Markov chain
   along sequences. We consider the finite loci case and two or more
   sequences. We formulate a natural Markovian approximation for the tree
   building process along the sequences, and derive simple and analytically
   tractable formulae for the distribution of the tree at the next locus
   conditioned on the tree at the present locus. We compare our Markov
   approximation to other sequential Markov chains and discuss various

Title = {Evolution with stochastic fitnesses: A role for recombination},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {86},
Pages = {29-42},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Phenotypic adaptation to fluctuating environments has been an important
   focus in the population genetic literature. Previous studies have shown
   that evolution under temporal variation is determined not only by
   expected fitness in a given generation, but also by the degree of
   variation in fitness over generations; in an uncertain environment,
   alleles that increase the geometric mean fitness can invade a randomly
   mating population at equilibrium. This geometric mean principle governs
   the evolutionary interplay of genes controlling mean phenotype and genes
   controlling phenotypic variation, such as genetic regulators of the
   epigenetic machinery. Thus, it establishes an important role for
   stochastic epigenetic variation in adaptation to fluctuating
   environments: by modifying the geometric mean fitness,
   variance-modifying genes can change the course of evolution and
   determine the long-term trajectory of the evolving system. The role of
   phenotypic variance has previously been studied in systems in which the
   only driving force is natural selection, and there is no recombination
   between mean- and variance-modifying genes. Here, we develop a
   population genetic model to investigate the effect of recombination
   between mean- and variance-modifiers of phenotype on the geometric mean
   principle under different environmental regimes and fitness landscapes.
   We show that interactions of recombination with stochastic epigenetic
   variation and environmental fluctuations can give rise to complex
   evolutionary dynamics that differ from those in systems with no
   recombination. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Optimal policies aimed at stabilization of populations with logistic

Volume = {83},
Pages = {123-135},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {This work examines both positive and negative impacts that economic
   growth may have on the ecological dynamics and stability of a single
   biological species. Local extinction of the species may force the social
   planner to implement defensive expenditures aimed at conservation of the
   species population by means of habitat protection. The latter may lead
   to an ecological equilibrium that will be different from the natural
   equilibrium that would have arisen in the absence of human intervention.
   Moreover, the existence of such equilibrium is formally demonstrated and
   its stability properties are revised. Additionally, optimal-choice
   decision policies are constructed on the basis of Pontryagin's maximum
   principle. Under such policies together with initial abundance of the
   species, the growth trajectories will move the system towards the fixed
   point of maximum species abundance. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {The Recombination Hotspot Paradox: Co-evolution between PRDM9 and its
   target sites},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {153},
Pages = {69-90},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Recombination often concentrates in small regions called recombination
   hotspots where recombination is much higher than the genome's average.
   In many vertebrates, including humans, gene PRDM9 specifies which DNA
   motifs will be the target for breaks that initiate recombination,
   ultimately determining the location of recombination hotspots. Because
   the sequence that breaks (allowing recombination) is converted into the
   sequence that does not break (preventing recombination), the latter
   sequence is over-transmitted to future generations and recombination
   hotspots are selfdestructive. Given their self-destructive nature,
   recombination hotspots should eventually become extinct in genomes where
   they are found. While empirical evidence shows that individual hotspots
   do become inactive over time (die), hotspots are abundant in many
   vertebrates: a contradiction called the Recombination Hotspot Paradox.
   What saves recombination hotspots from their foretold extinction? Here
   we formulate a co-evolutionary model of the interaction among
   sequence-specific gene conversion, fertility selection, and recurrent
   mutation. We find that allelic frequencies oscillate leading to stable
   limit cycles. From a biological perspective this means that when
   fertility selection is weaker than gene conversion, it cannot stop
   individual hotspots from dying but can save them from extinction by
   driving their re-activation (resuscitation). In our model, mutation
   balances death and resuscitation of hotspots, thus maintaining their
   number over evolutionary time. Interestingly, we find that multiple
   alleles result in oscillations that are chaotic and multiple targets in
   oscillations that are asynchronous between targets thus helping to
   maintain the average genomic recombination probability constant.
   Furthermore, we find that the level of expression of PRDM9 should
   control for the fraction of targets that are hotspots and the overall
   temperature of the genome. Therefore, our coevolutionary model improves
   our understanding of how hotspots may be replaced, thus contributing to
   solve the Recombination Hotspot Paradox. From a more applied perspective
   our work provides testable predictions regarding the relation between
   mutation probability and fertility selection with life expectancy of
   hotspots. \& COPY; 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc. This

Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},

Abstract = {Chan, Durrett, and Lanchier introduced a multitype contact process with
   temporal heterogeneity involving two species competing for space on the
   d-dimensional integer lattice. Time is divided into two seasons. They
   proved that there is an open set of the parameters for which both
   species can coexist when their dispersal range is sufficiently large.
   Numerical simulations suggested that three species can coexist in the
   presence of two seasons. The main point of this paper is to prove that
   this conjecture is incorrect. To do this we prove results for a more
   general ODE model and contrast its behavior with other related systems
   that have been studied in order to understand the competitive exclusion

   models},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {147},
Pages = {16-27},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {A number of powerful demographic inference methods have been developed
   in recent years, with the goal of fitting rich evolutionary models to
   genetic data obtained from many populations. In this paper we
   investigate the statistical performance of these methods in the specific
   case where there is continuous migration between populations. Compared
   with earlier work, migration significantly complicates the theoretical
   analysis and requires new techniques. We employ the theories of
   phase-type distributions and concentration of measure in order to study
   the two-island and isolation-withmigration models, resulting in both
   upper and lower bounds on rates of convergence for parametric estimators
   in migration models. For the upper bounds, we consider inferring rates
   of coalescent and migration on the basis of directly observing pairwise
   coalescent times, and, more realistically, when (conditionally)
   Poisson-distributed mutations dropped on latent trees are observed. We
   complement these upper bounds with information-theoretic lower bounds
   which establish a limit, in terms of sample size, below which inference
   is effectively impossible.},

Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},

Volume = {146},
Pages = {46-60},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The site frequency spectrum (SFS) is an important statistic that
   summarizes the molecular variation in a population, and is used to
   estimate population-genetic parameters and detect natural selection.
   Here, we study the SFS in a randomly mating, diploid population in which
   both the population size and selection coefficient vary periodically
   with time using a diffusion theory approach, and derive simple
   analytical expressions for the time-averaged SFS in slowly and rapidly
   changing environments. We show that for strong selection and in slowly
   changing environments where the population experiences both positive and
   negative cycles of the selection coefficient, the time-averaged SFS
   differs significantly from the equilibrium SFS in a constant
   environment. The deviation is found to depend on the time spent by the
   population in the deleterious part of the selection cycle and the phase
   difference between the selection coefficient and population size, and
   can be captured by an effective population size. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Title = {Time to extinction of a cultural trait in an overlapping generation
   model},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {137},
Pages = {32-45},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {How long a newly emerging trait will stay in a population is a
   fundamental but rarely asked question in cultural evolution. To tackle
   this question, the distribution and mean of the time to extinction of a
   discrete cultural trait are derived for models with overlapping
   generations, in which trait transmission occurs from multiple role
   models to a single newborn and may fail with a certain probability. We
   explore two models. The first is a Moran-type model, which allows us to
   derive the exact analytical formula for the mean time to extinction of a
   trait in a finite population. The second is a branching process, which
   assumes an infinitely large population and allows us to derive
   approximate analytical formulae for the distribution and mean of the
   time to extinction in the first model under a large population size. We
   show that in the first model, the mean time to extinction apparently
   diverges (becomes so large that even numerical computation is
   impractical) under a certain parameter condition as the population size
   tends to infinity. Using the second model, we explain the underlying
   mechanism of the apparent divergence found in the first model and derive
   the mathematical condition for this divergence in terms of transmission
   efficiency and the number of role models per newborn. When this
   mathematical condition is satisfied in the second model, the probability
   of extinction is less than 1, and the mean extinction time does not
   exist. In addition, we find that in both models, the time to extinction
   of the trait becomes longer as the number of role models per individual
   increases and as cultural transmission becomes more efficient. (c) 2021

Title = {Fluctuations in lifetime selection in an autocorrelated environment},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {134},
Pages = {119-128},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Most natural environments vary stochastically and are temporally
   autocorrelated. Previous theory investigating the effects of
   environmental autocorrelation on evolution mostly assumed that total
   fitness resulted from a single selection episode. Yet organisms are
   likely to experience selection repeatedly along their life, in response
   to possibly different environmental states. We model the evolution of a
   quantitative trait in organisms with non-overlapping generations
   undergoing several episodes of selection in a randomly fluctuating and
   autocorrelated environment. We show that the evolutionary dynamics
   depends not directly on fluctuations of the environment, but instead on
   those of an effective phenotypic optimum that integrates the effects of
   all selection episodes within each generation. The variance and
   autocorrelation of the integrated optimum shape the variance and
   predictability of selection, with substantial qualitative and
   quantitative deviations from previous predictions considering a single
   selection episode per generation. We also investigate the consequence of
   multiple selection episodes per generation on population load. In
   particular, we identify a new load resulting from within-generation
   fluctuating selection, generating the death of individuals without
   significance for the evolutionary dynamics. Our study emphasizes how
   taking into account fluctuating selection within lifetime unravels new
   properties of evolutionary dynamics, with crucial implications notably
   with respect to responses to global changes. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All

Title = {Testing for population decline using maximal linkage disequilibrium
   blocks},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {134},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Only 6\% of known species have a conservation status. Methods that
   assess conservation statuses are often based on individual counts and
   are thus too laborious to be generalized to all species. Population
   genomics methods that infer past variations in population size are easy
   to use but limited to the relatively distant past. Here we propose a
   population genomics approach that tests for recent population decline
   and may be used to assess species conservation statuses. More
   specifically, we study Maximal Recombination Free (MRF) blocks, that are
   segments of a sequence alignment inherited from a common ancestor
   without recombination. MRF blocks are relatively longer in small than in
   large populations. We use the distribution of MRF block lengths rescaled
   by their mean to test for recent population decline. However, because
   MRF blocks are difficult to detect, we also consider Maximal Linkage
   Disequilibrium (MLD) blocks, which are runs of single nucleotide
   polymorphisms compatible with a single tree. We develop a new method
   capable of inferring a very recent decline (e.g. with a detection power
   of 50\% for populations whose size was halved to N, 0.05 xN generations
   ago) from rescaled MLD block lengths. Our framework could serve as a
   basis for quantitative tools to assess conservation status in a wide
   range of species. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {124},
Pages = {41-50},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {We revisit the classical, and introduce a novel, concept of two-locus
   linkage disequilibrium (LD). In contrast to defining haplotypes as
   allele combinations at two marker loci, we concentrate on the clustering
   of a sample of chromosomes induced by their coalescent genealogy. The
   root of a binary coalescent tree defines two clusters of chromosomes,
   each one of them containing the left and right descendants of the root.
   At two different loci this assignment may be different as a result of
   recombination. We show that the proportion of shared chromosomes among
   clusters at two different loci, measured by the squared correlation,
   constitutes a natural measure of LD. We call this topological LD (tLD)
   since it is induced by the topology of the coalescent tree. We find that
   it is, on average, larger than classical LD for any given distance
   between loci. Furthermore, tLD has a smaller coefficient of variation,
   which should provide an advantage, compared to the use of classical LD,
   for any kind of mapping purposes. We conclude with a practical
   application to the LCT region in human populations. (C) 2018 Elsevier

Title = {Fast cheater migration stabilizes coexistence in a public goods dilemma
   on networks},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {121},
Pages = {12-25},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Through the lens of game theory, cooperation is frequently considered an
   unsustainable strategy: if an entire population is cooperating, each
   individual can increase its overall fitness by choosing not to
   cooperate, thereby still receiving all the benefit of its cooperating
   neighbors while no longer expending its own energy. Observable
   cooperation in naturally-occurring public goods games is consequently of
   great interest, as such systems offer insight into both the emergence
   and sustainability of cooperation. Here we consider a population that
   obeys a public goods game on a network of discrete regions (that we call
   colonies), between any two of which individuals are free to migrate. We
   construct a system of piecewise-smooth ordinary differential equations
   that couple the within-colony population dynamics and the between-colony
   migratory dynamics. Through a combination of analytical and numerical
   methods, we show that if the workers within the population migrate
   sufficiently fast relative to the cheaters, the network loses stability
   first through a Hopf bifurcation, then a torus bifurcation, after which
   one or more colonies collapse. Our results indicate that fast moving
   cheaters can act to stabilize worker-cheater coexistence within network
   that would otherwise collapse. We end with a comparison of our results
   with the dynamics observed in colonies of the ant species Pristomyrmex
   punctatus, and argue that they qualitatively agree. (C) 2018 Elsevier

Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {116},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Spirochetes belonging to the Borrelia burgdoferi sensu lato (sl) group
   cause Lyme Borreliosis (LB), which is the most commonly reported
   vector-borne zoonosis in Europe. B. burgdorferi sl is maintained in
   nature in a complex cycle involving Ixodes ricinus ticks and several
   species of vertebrate hosts. The transmission dynamics of B. burgdorferi
   sl is complicated by the varying competence of animals for different
   genospecies of spirochetes that, in turn, vary in their capability of
   causing disease. In this study, a set of difference equations
   simplifying the complex interaction between vectors and their hosts
   (competent and not for Borrelia) is built to gain insights into
   conditions underlying the dominance of B. lusitaniae (transmitted by
   lizards to susceptible ticks) and the maintenance of B. afzelii
   (transmitted by wild rodents) observed in a study area in Tuscany,
   Italy. Findings, in agreement with field observations, highlight the
   existence of a threshold for the fraction of larvae feeding on rodents
   below which the persistence of B. afzelii is not possible. Furthermore,
   thresholds change as nonlinear functions of the expected number of nymph
   bites on mice, and the transmission and recovery probabilities. In
   conclusion, our model provided an insight into mechanisms underlying the
   relative frequency of different Borrelia genospecies, as observed in
   field studies. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Transience after disturbance: Obligate species recovery dynamics depend
   on disturbance duration},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {115},
Pages = {81-88},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {After a disturbance event, population recovery becomes an important
   species response that drives ecosystem dynamics. Yet, it is unclear how
   interspecific interactions impact species recovery from a disturbance
   and which role the disturbance duration (pulse or press) plays. Here, we
   analytically derive conditions that govern the transient recovery
   dynamics from disturbance of a host and its obligately dependent partner
   in a two-species metapopulation model. We find that, after disturbance,
   species recovery dynamics depend on the species' role (i.e. host or
   obligately dependent species) as well as the duration of disturbance.
   Host recovery starts immediately after the disturbance. In contrast, for
   obligate species, recovery depends on disturbance duration. After press
   disturbance, which allows dynamics to equilibrate during disturbance,
   obligate species immediately start to recover. Yet, after pulse
   disturbance, obligate species continue declining although their hosts
   have already begun to increase. Effectively, obligate species recovery
   is delayed until a necessary host threshold occupancy is reached.
   Obligates' delayed recovery arises solely from interspecific
   interactions independent of dispersal limitations, which contests
   previous explanations. Delayed recovery exerts a two-fold negative
   effect, because populations continue declining to even smaller
   population sizes and the phase of increased risk from demographic
   stochastic extinction in small populations is prolonged. We argue that
   delayed recovery and its determinants species interactions and
   disturbance duration - have to be considered in biodiversity
   management.(C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

   that are only partially effective. We show that the cumulative risk
   compensation that occurs between a high risk susceptible and infectious
   individual may play an important role in whether the implementation of
   these measures is successful in lowering the epidemic reproductive
   number. In addition, we show that certain levels of risk compensation
   may cancel the benefit of the low infection risk practiced by diagnosed
   infectious individuals when the goal is a reduction of the epidemic
   reproductive number. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {The non-equilibrium allele frequency spectrum in a Poisson random field
   framework},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {111},
Pages = {51-64},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In population genetic studies, the allele frequency spectrum (AFS)
   efficiently summarizes genomewide polymorphism data and shapes a variety
   of allele frequency-based summary statistics. While existing theory
   typically features equilibrium conditions, emerging methodology requires
   an analytical understanding of the build-up of the allele frequencies
   over time. In this work, we use the framework of Poisson random fields
   to derive new representations of the non-equilibrium AFS for the case of
   a Wright-Fisher population model with selection. In our approach, the
   AFS is a scaling-limit of the expectation of a Poisson stochastic
   integral and the representation of the non-equilibrium AFS arises in
   terms of a fixation time probability distribution. The known duality
   between the Wright-Fisher diffusion process and a birth and death
   process generalizing Kingman's coalescent yields an additional
   representation. The results carry over to the setting of a random sample
   drawn from the population and provide the non-equilibrium behavior of
   sample statistics. Our findings are consistent with and extend a
   previous approach where the non-equilibrium AFS solves a partial
   differential forward equation with a non-traditional boundary condition.
   Moreover, we provide a bridge to previous coalescent-based work, and
   hence tie several frameworks together. Since frequency-based summary
   statistics are widely used in population genetics, for example, to
   identify candidate loci of adaptive evolution, to infer the demographic
   history of a population, or to improve our understanding of the
   underlying mechanics of speciation events, the presented results are
   potentially useful for a broad range of topics. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Title = {Delay driven spatiotemporal chaos in single species population dynamics
   models},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {110},
Pages = {51-62},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Questions surrounding the prevalence of complex population dynamics form
   one of the central themes in ecology. Limit cycles and spatiotemporal
   chaos are examples that have been widely recognised theoretically,
   although their importance and applicability to natural populations
   remains debatable. The ecological processes underlying such dynamics are
   thought to be numerous, though there seems to be consent as to delayed
   density dependence being one of the main driving forces. Indeed, time
   delay is a common feature of many ecological systems and can
   significantly influence population dynamics. In general, time delays may
   arise from inter- and intra-specific trophic interactions or population
   structure, however in the context of single species populations they are
   linked to more intrinsic biological phenomena such as gestation or
   resource regeneration. In this paper, we consider theoretically the
   spatiotemporal dynamics of a single species population using two
   different mathematical formulations. Firstly, we revisit the diffusive
   logistic equation in which the per capita growth is a function of some
   specified delayed argument. We then modify the model by incorporating a
   spatial convolution which results in a biologically more viable
   integro-differential model. Using the combination of analytical and
   numerical techniques, we investigate the effect of time delay on pattern
   formation. In particular, we show that for sufficiently large values of
   time delay the system's dynamics are indicative to spatiotemporal chaos.
   The chaotic dynamics arising in the wake of a travelling population
   front can be preceded by either a plateau corresponding to dynamical
   stabilisation of the unstable equilibrium or by periodic oscillations.

Title = {Abiotic and biotic interactions determine whether increased colonization
   is beneficial or detrimental to metapopulation management},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {109},
Pages = {44-53},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Increasing the colonization rate of metapopulations can improve
   persistence, but can also increase exposure to threats. To make good
   decisions, managers must understand whether increased colonization is
   beneficial or detrimental to metapopulation persistence. While a number
   of studies have examined interactions between metapopulations,
   colonization, and threats, they have assumed that threat dynamics
   respond linearly to changes in colonization. Here, we determined when to
   increase colonization while explicitly accounting for non-linear
   dependencies between a metapopulation and its threats. We developed
   patch occupancy metapopulation models for species susceptible to
   abiotic, generalist, and specialist threats and modeled the total
   derivative of the equilibrium proportion of patches occupied by each
   metapopulation with respect to the colonization rate. By using the total
   derivative, we developed a rule for determining when to increase
   metapopulation colonization. This rule was applied to a simulated
   metapopulation where the dynamics of each threat responded to increased
   colonization following a power function. Before modifying colonization,
   we show that managers must understand: (1) whether a metapopulation is
   susceptible to a threat; (2) the type of threat acting on a
   metapopulation; (3) which component of threat dynamics might depend on
   colonization, and; (4) the likely response of a threat dependent
   variable to changes in colonization. The sensitivity of management
   decisions to these interactions increases uncertainty in conservation
   planning decisions. Crown Copyright (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Inc.

Title = {Spread of pedigree versus genetic ancestry in spatially distributed
   populations},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {108},
Pages = {1-12},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Ancestral processes are fundamental to modern population genetics and
   spatial structure has been the subject of intense interest for many
   years. Despite this interest, almost nothing is known about the
   distribution of the locations of pedigree or genetic ancestors. Using
   both spatially continuous and stepping-stone models, we show that the
   distribution of pedigree ancestors approaches a travelling wave, for
   which we develop two alternative approximations. The speed and width of
   the wave are sensitive to the local details of the model. After a short
   time, genetic ancestors spread far more slowly than pedigree ancestors,
   ultimately diffusing out with radius similar to root t rather than
   spreading at constant speed. In contrast to the wave of pedigree
   ancestors, the spread of genetic ancestry is insensitive to the local
   details of the models. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.},

Title = {Fitness-valley crossing with generalized parent-offspring transmission},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {105},
Pages = {1-16},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Simple and ubiquitous gene interactions create rugged fitness landscapes
   composed of coadapted gene complexes separated by ``valleys{''} of low
   fitness. Crossing such fitness valleys allows a population to escape
   suboptimal local fitness peaks to become better adapted. This is the
   premise of Sewall Wright's shifting balance process. Here we generalize
   the theory of fitness-valley crossing in the two-locus, bi- allelic case
   by allowing bias in parent-offspring transmission. This generalization
   extends the existing mathematical framework to genetic systems with
   segregation distortion and uniparental inheritance. Our results are also
   flexible enough to provide insight into shifts between alternate stable
   states in cultural systems with ``transmission valleys{''}. Using a
   semi-deterministic analysis and a stochastic diffusion approximation, we
   focus on the limiting step in valley crossing: the first appearance of
   the genotype on the new fitness peak whose lineage will eventually fix.
   We then apply our results to specific cases of segregation distortion,
   uniparental inheritance, and cultural transmission. Segregation
   distortion favouring mutant alleles facilitates crossing most when
   recombination and mutation are rare, i.e., scenarios where crossing is
   otherwise unlikely. Interactions with more mutable genes (e.g.,
   uniparental inherited cytoplasmic elements) substantially reduce
   crossing times. Despite component traits being passed on poorly in the
   previous cultural background, small advantages in the transmission of a
   new combination of cultural traits can greatly facilitate a cultural
   transition. While peak shifts are unlikely under many of the common
   assumptions of population genetic theory, relaxing some of these
   assumptions can promote fitness-valley crossing. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Title = {A two-locus model of spatially varying stabilizing or directional
   selection on a quantitative trait},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {94},
Pages = {10-41},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The consequences of spatially varying, stabilizing or directional
   selection on a quantitative trait in a subdivided population are
   studied. A deterministic two-locus two-deme model is employed to explore
   the effects of migration, the degree of divergent selection, and the
   genetic architecture, i.e., the recombination rate and ratio of locus
   effects, on the maintenance of genetic variation. The possible
   equilibrium configurations are determined as functions of the migration
   rate. They depend crucially on the strength of divergent selection and
   the genetic architecture. The maximum migration rates are investigated
   below which a stable fully polymorphic equilibrium or a stable
   single-locus polymorphism can exist. Under stabilizing selection, but
   with different optima in the demes, strong recombination may facilitate
   the maintenance of polymorphism. However usually, and in particular with
   directional selection in opposite direction, the critical migration
   rates are maximized by a concentrated genetic architecture, i.e., by a
   major locus and a tightly linked minor one. Thus, complementing previous
   work on the evolution of genetic architectures in subdivided populations
   subject to diversifying selection, it is shown that concentrated
   architectures may aid the maintenance of polymorphism. Conditions are
   obtained when this is the case. Finally, the dependence of the
   phenotypic variance, linkage disequilibrium, and various measures of
   local adaptation and differentiation on the parameters is elaborated.

Title = {Species abundance distributions, statistical mechanics and the priors of
   MaxEnt},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {92},
Pages = {69-77},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The methods of Maximum Entropy have been deployed for some years to
   address the problem of species abundance distributions. In this
   approach, it is important to identify the correct weighting factors, or
   priors, to be applied before maximising the entropy function subject to
   constraints. The forms of such priors depend not only on the exact
   problem but can also depend on the way it is set up; priors are
   determined by the underlying dynamics of the complex system under
   consideration. The problem is one of statistical mechanics and it is the
   properties of the system that yield the correct MaxEnt priors,
   appropriate to the way the problem is framed. Here I calculate, in
   several different ways, the species abundance distribution resulting
   when individuals in a community are born and die independently. In the
   usual formulation the prior distribution for the number of species over
   the number of individuals is 1/n; the problem can be reformulated in
   terms of the distribution of individuals over species classes, with a
   uniform prior. Results are obtained using master equations for the
   dynamics and separately through the combinatoric methods of elementary
   statistical mechanics; the MaxEnt priors then emerge a posteriori. The
   first object is to establish the log series species abundance
   distribution as the outcome of per capita guild dynamics. The second is
   to clarify the true nature and origin of priors in the language of
   MaxEnt. Finally, I consider how it may come about that the distribution
   is similar to log series in the event that Filled niches dominate
   species abundance. For the general ecologist, there are two messages.
   First, that species abundance distributions are determined largely by
   population sorting through fractional processes (resulting in the 1/n
   factor) and secondly that useful information is likely to be found only
   in departures from the log series. For the MaxEnt practitioner, the
   message is that the prior with respect to which the entropy is to be
   maximised is determined by the nature of the problem and the way in
   which it is formulated. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {New approaches to source-sink metapopulations decoupling demography and
   dispersal},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {88},
Pages = {31-46},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Source-sink systems are metapopulations of patches with different, and
   possibly temporally varying, habitat qualities, which are commonly used
   in ecology to study the fate of spatially extended populations.
   We propose new techniques that disentangle the respective contributions
   of demography and dispersal to the dynamics and fate of a single species
   in a source-sink system. Our approach is valid for a general class of
   stochastic, individual-based, stepping-stone models, with
   density-independent demography and dispersal, provided that the
   metapopulation is finite or else enjoys some transitivity property.
   We provide (1) a simple criterion of persistence, by studying the motion
   of a single random disperser until it returns to its initial position;
   (2) a joint characterization of the long-term growth rate and of the
   asymptotic occupancy frequencies of the ancestral lineage of a random
   survivor, by using large deviations theory. Both techniques yield
   formulas decoupling demography and dispersal, and can be adapted to the
   case of periodic or random environments, where habitat qualities are
   autocorrelated in space and possibly in time.
   In this last case, we display examples of coupled time-averaged sinks
   allowing survival, as was previously known in the absence of demographic
   stochasticity for fully mixing (Jansen and Yoshimura, 1998) or partially
   mixing (Evans et al., 2012; Schreiber, 2010) metapopulations. (C) 2013

Title = {The role of cultural transmission in human demographic change: An
   age-structured model},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {88},
Pages = {68-77},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Human populations vary demographically with population sizes ranging
   from small groups of hunter-gatherers with less than fifty individuals
   to vast cities containing many millions. Here we investigate how the
   cultural transmission of traits affecting survival, fertility, or both
   can influence the birth rate, age structure, and asymptotic growth rate
   of a population. We show that the strong spread of such a trait can lead
   to a demographic transition, similar to that experienced in Europe in
   the late 19th and early 20th centuries, without using ecological or
   economic optimizing models. We also show that the spread of a cultural
   trait that increases fertility, but not survival, can cause demographic
   change similar to the `Neolithic demographic transition': a period of
   increased population growth that is thought to have accompanied the
   transition from hunter-gatherer to agricultural lifestyles. We
   investigate the roles of vertical, oblique, and horizontal learning of
   such a trait in this transition and find that compared to vertical
   learning alone, horizontal and oblique learning can accelerate the
   trait's spread, lead to faster population growth, and increase its
   equilibrium frequency. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Inference in two dimensions: Allele frequencies versus lengths of shared
   sequence blocks},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {87},
Pages = {105-119},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {We outline two approaches to inference of neighbourhood size, X, and
   dispersal rate, sigma(2), based on either allele frequencies or on the
   lengths of sequence blocks that are shared between genomes. Over
   intermediate timescales (10-100 generations, say), populations that live
   in two dimensions approach a quasi-equilibrium that is independent of
   both their local structure and their deeper history. Over such scales,
   the standardised covariance of allele frequencies (i.e. pairwise F-ST)
   falls with the logarithm of distance, and depends only on neighbourhood
   size, N , and a `local scale', kappa; the rate of gene flow, sigma(2),
   cannot be inferred. We show how spatial correlations can be accounted
   for, assuming a Gaussian distribution of allele frequencies, giving
   maximum likelihood estimates of N and kappa. Alternatively, inferences
   can be based on the distribution of the lengths of sequence that are
   identical between blocks of genomes: long blocks (>0.1 cM, say) tell us
   about intermediate timescales, over which we assume a quasi-equilibrium.
   For large neighbourhood size, the distribution of long blocks is given
   directly by the classical Wright-Malecot formula; this relationship can
   be used to infer both N and sigma(2). With small neighbourhood size,
   there is an appreciable chance that recombinant lineages will coalesce
   back before escaping into the distant past. For this case, we show that
   if genomes are sampled from some distance apart, then the distribution
   of lengths of blocks that are identical in state is geometric, with a
   mean that depends on N and sigma(2). (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {The effect of fluctuating selection on the genealogy at a linked site},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {87},
Pages = {34-50},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The genealogical consequences of temporally fluctuating selection at
   linked neutrally-evolving sites are studied using coalescent processes
   structured by genetic backgrounds. Surprisingly, although
   between-generation fluctuating selection and within-generation fecundity
   variance polymorphism lead to indistinguishable allele frequency
   dynamics at the selected site, I show that these two scenarios affect
   the genealogical structure of the population in distinctive ways.
   Whereas coalescence times are elevated at the selected site when
   heterozygotes have lower within-generation fecundity variance than
   either homozygote, fluctuating selection typically depresses the depth
   of the genealogy at tightly-linked sites. More importantly, these
   results indicate that fluctuating selection will have a characteristic
   signature combining an excess of selected variation at the affected site
   and a slight reduction in neutral variation at tightly linked sites.
   This observation suggests that it may be possible to distinguish
   balanced polymorphisms maintained by environmental variation from those
   maintained by heterozygote advantage. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {84},
Pages = {36-45},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The rich theory of infectious disease modelling using the
   Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) framework is mainly based on the
   assumption of a well-mixed population, under which evolutionary
   behaviours (typically derived using adaptive dynamics) are shown to
   depend critically on the qualitative features of a
   virulence-transmission trade-off. Spatial extensions of this work, using
   simulation studies, show multiple evolutionary outcomes, which strongly
   depend on trade-off shape and, additionally, the length scale of the
   infectious process. In this paper, we aim to shed analytical insight
   into the mechanisms underlying these spatial evolutionary outcomes. In
   particular, why there is a qualitative difference observed in the
   evolutionary predicted virulence rates between linear and decelerating
   trade-offs between transmission and virulence and how recovery can
   weaken the effect of space. We use both pair approximations and cellular
   automata to model the spatial populations and the analysis exploits
   small neighbourhood variations in the spatial settings. The evolutionary
   outcomes are derived using adaptive dynamics. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All

Title = {Conditions for patchiness in plankton models},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {83},
Pages = {95-100},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Plankton patchiness in homogeneous physical environments is studied in
   this paper assuming that all involved populations disperse diffusively.
   A recent but powerful sufficient condition for the emergence of spatial
   patterns in models with any number of species is systematically applied
   to all food chain and food web plankton models and the result is rather
   sharp: all models explicitly containing phytoplankton, zooplankton and
   planktivorous fish suggest zooplankton patchiness, while models not
   containing phytoplankton or fish populations do not. The results are in
   agreement with many previous but particular theoretical studies on
   plankton patchiness and Turing instability, and a testable prediction of
   the models satisfying the sufficient predictions is that zooplankton
   should be more patchy than phytoplankton, a property that is often seen
   in natural settings. An application to a complex model with five
   compartments (nutrient, phytoplankton, zooplankton, planktivorous fish,
   carnivorous fish) highlights the predictive power of the method. (C)

Abstract = {Humans have created highly developed cultures, brought about by
   iterative improvements in technology. Using a mathematical model, I
   investigated the conditions under which cultural traits tend to be
   improved for a higher level of culture to evolve. In the model, I
   consider three ways of learning: individual learning, simple social
   learning, and improvements of socially learned cultural traits (social
   improvement). I obtain the evolutionarily stable number of cultural
   traits acquired through each way of learning. I show that organisms
   improve many socially learned cultural traits under the following
   conditions: (1) environmental stability is intermediate; (2) the
   environment is severe; (3) the success rate of individual learning is
   high; (4) the utility of cultural traits acquired by individual learning
   is large; (5) the accuracy of social learning is high; and (6) the
   increase in the utility of beneficial cultural traits attained by social
   improvement is large. I also show that when organisms have greater
   ability for social improvement, the average utility of the beneficial
   cultural trait increases, the proportion of beneficial cultural traits
   among all cultural traits decreases, and the total number of cultural
   traits acquired by the three ways of learning is constant. These results
   shed light on the origins of human cumulative culture. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Title = {Temporal variability can promote migration between habitats},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {158},
Pages = {195-205},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Understanding the conditions that promote the evolution of migration is
   important in ecology and evolution. When environments are fixed and
   there is one most favorable site, migration to other sites lowers
   overall growth rate and is not favored. Here we ask, can environmental
   variability favor migration when there is one best site on average?
   Previous work suggests that the answer is yes, but a general and precise
   answer remained elusive. Here we establish new, rigorous inequalities to
   show (and use simulations to illustrate) how stochastic growth rate can
   increase with migration when fitness (dis)advantages fluctuate over time
   across sites. The effect of migration between sites on the overall
   stochastic growth rate depends on the difference in expected growth
   rates and the variance of the fluctuating difference in growth rates.
   When fluctuations (variance) are large, a population can benefit from
   bursts of higher growth in sites that are worse on average. Such bursts
   become more probable as the between-site variance increases. Our results
   apply to many ( >= 2) sites, and reveal an interplay between the length
   of paths between sites, the average differences in site-specific growth
   rates, and the size of fluctuations. Our findings have implications for
   evolutionary biology as they provide conditions for departure from the
   reduction principle, and for ecological dynamics: even when there are
   superior sites in a sea of poor habitats, variability and habitat
   quality across space determine the importance of migration.},

Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {155},
Pages = {1-9},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {By quantifying key life history parameters in populations, such as
   growth rate, longevity, and generation time, researchers and
   administrators can obtain valuable insights into its dynamics. Although
   point estimates of demographic parameters have been available since the
   inception of demography as a scientific discipline, the construction of
   confidence intervals has typically relied on approximations through
   series expansions or computationally intensive techniques. This study
   introduces the first mathematical expression for calculating confidence
   intervals for the aforementioned life history traits when individuals
   are unidentifiable and data are presented as a life table. The key
   finding is the accurate estimation of the confidence interval for r, the
   instantaneous growth rate, which is tested using Monte Carlo simulations
   with four arbitrary discrete distributions. In comparison to the
   bootstrap method, the proposed interval construction method proves more
   efficient, particularly for experiments with a total offspring size
   below 400. We discuss handling cases where data are organized in
   extended life tables or as a matrix of vital rates. We have developed
   and provided accompanying code to facilitate these computations.},

Title = {Variances and covariances of linear summary statistics of segregating
   sites},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {145},
Pages = {95-108},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Each mutation in a population sample of DNA sequences can be classified
   by the number of sequences that inherit the mutant nucleotide, the
   resulting frequencies are known as mutations of different sizes or site
   frequency spectrum. Many summary statistics can be defined as a linear
   function of these frequencies. A flexible class of such linear summary
   statistics is explored analytically in this paper which include several
   well-known quantities, such as the number of segregating sizes and the
   mean number of nucleotide differences between two sequences. Some
   asymptotic variances and covariances are obtained while the analytical
   formulas for the variances and covariances of nine such linear summary
   statistics are derived, most of which are unknown to date. This study
   not only provides some theoretical foundations for exploring linear
   summary statistics, but also provides some newlinear summary statistics
   that may be utilized for analyzing sample polymorphism. Furthermore it
   is showed that a newly developed linear summary statistics has a smaller
   variance almost uniformly than Watterson's estimator, and that a class
   of linear summary statistics given too heavy weights on mutations of
   smaller sizes result in asymptotically non-zero variance. (C) 2022

Title = {Hominin forager technology, food sharing, and diet breadth},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {144},
Pages = {37-48},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {We propose a predator-prey model to explain diachronic changes in
   Palaeolithic diet breadth. The fraction of rapidly-reproducing
   hard-to-catch hares and birds among small animals in the hominin diet
   shows a significant increase between the Middle and Upper Palaeolithic
   in the Levant, with an associated decrease in slowly-reproducing
   easily-caught tortoises. Our model interprets this fraction in terms of
   foraging effort allocated to, and foraging efficiency for each of these
   two classes of resource, in addition to their abundances. We focus on
   evolutionary adjustments in the allocation of foraging effort. The
   convergence stable strategy (CSS) of foraging effort and the dietary
   fraction of hares/birds are both highly sensitive to variation in the
   foraging efficiencies, which may have been upgraded by advanced
   technology introduced from Africa or developed locally. A positive
   correlation (not necessarily a cause and effect relationship) is
   observed between this fraction and forager population when the foraging
   efficiency for hares/birds is varied. Overexploitation can however
   result in a reduction of both diet breadth and forager population, as
   can food sharing within the forager group. Food sharing is routine among
   recent (and perhaps also Palaeolithic) foragers. We speculate that some
   controversial issues regarding this public goods problem might be
   resolved if we could incorporate sexual selection into our model. (c)

Title = {Inclusive fitness and Hamilton's rule in a stochastic environment},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {142},
Pages = {91-99},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The evolution of cooperation in Prisoner's Dilemmas with additive random
   cost and benefit for cooperation cannot be accounted for by Hamilton's
   rule based on mean effects transferred from recipients to donors
   weighted by coefficients of relatedness, which defines inclusive fitness
   in a constant environment. Extensions that involve higher moments of
   stochastic effects are possible, however, and these are connected to a
   concept of random inclusive fitness that is frequency-dependent. This is
   shown in the setting of pairwise interactions in a haploid population
   with the same coefficient of relatedness between interacting players. In
   an infinite population, fixation of cooperation is stochastically stable
   if a mean geometric inclusive fitness of defection when rare is
   negative, while fixation of defection is stochastically unstable if a
   mean geometric inclusive fitness of cooperation when rare is positive,
   and these conditions are generally not equivalent. In a finite
   population, the probability for cooperation to ultimately fix when
   represented once exceeds the probability under neutrality or the
   corresponding probability for defection if the mean inclusive fitness of
   cooperation when its frequency is 1/3 or 1/2, respectively, exceeds 1.
   All these results rely on the simplifying assumption of a linear fitness
   function. It is argued that meaningful applications of random inclusive
   fitness in complex settings (multi-player game, diploidy, population
   structure) would generally require conditions of weak selection and
   additive gene action. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Exact site frequency spectra of neutrally evolving tumors: A transition

Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {142},
Pages = {67-90},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The site frequency spectrum (SFS) is a popular summary statistic of
   genomic data. While the SFS of a constant-sized population undergoing
   neutral mutations has been extensively studied in population genetics,
   the rapidly growing amount of cancer genomic data has attracted interest
   in the spectrum of an exponentially growing population. Recent
   theoretical results have generally dealt with special or limiting cases,
   such as considering only cells with an infinite line of descent,
   assuming deterministic tumor growth, or taking large-time or
   large-population limits. In this work, we derive exact expressions for
   the expected SFS of a cell population that evolves according to a
   stochastic branching process, first for cells with an infinite line of
   descent and then for the total population, evaluated either at a fixed
   time (fixed-time spectrum) or at the stochastic time at which the
   population reaches a certain size (fixed-size spectrum). We find that
   while the rate of mutation scales the SFS of the total population
   linearly, the rates of cell birth and cell death change the shape of the
   spectrum at the small-frequency end, inducing a transition between a
   1/j(2) power-law spectrum and a 1/j spectrum as cell viability
   decreases. We show that this insight can in principle be used to
   estimate the ratio between the rate of cell death and cell birth, as
   well as the mutation rate, using the site frequency spectrum alone.
   Although the discussion is framed in terms of tumor dynamics, our
   results apply to any exponentially growing population of individuals
   undergoing neutral mutations. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {Quantifying the impact of changes in effective population size and
   expression level on the rate of coding sequence evolution},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {142},
Pages = {57-66},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Molecular sequences are shaped by selection, where the strength of
   selection relative to drift is determined by effective population size
   (N-e). Populations with high N-e are expected to undergo stronger
   purifying selection, and consequently to show a lower substitution rate
   for selected mutations relative to the substitution rate for neutral
   mutations (omega). However, computational models based on biophysics of
   protein stability have suggested that w can also be independent of N-e.
   Together, the response of omega to changes in N-e depends on the
   specific mapping from sequence to fitness. Importantly, an increase in
   protein expression level has been found empirically to result in
   decrease of omega, an observation predicted by theoretical models
   assuming selection for protein stability. Here, we derive a theoretical
   approximation for the response of omega to changes in N-e and expression
   level, under an explicit genotype-phenotype-fitness map. The method is
   generally valid for additive traits and log-concave fitness functions.
   We applied these results to protein undergoing selection for their
   conformational stability and corroborate out findings with simulations
   under more complex models. We predict a weak response of omega to
   changes in either N-e or expression level, which are interchangeable.
   Based on empirical data, we propose that fitness based on the
   conformational stability may not be a sufficient mechanism to explain
   the empirically observed variation in omega across species. Other
   aspects of protein biophysics might be explored, such as protein-protein
   interactions, which can lead to a stronger response of omega to changes
   in N-e. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.},

Abstract = {The number of dines (i.e., polymorphic equilibria) maintained by a
   step-environment in a unidimensional pocket at a single diallelic locus
   is investigated. The monoecious population is locally panmictic; its
   density is uniform. Migration and viability selection are both weak; the
   former is homogeneous and symmetric; the latter is directional and
   usually specified by a unimodal function f(p) of the gene frequency p.
   If the ratio of the selection intensity to the migration rate exceeds a
   critical value, at least one dine exists. The general theorems on
   equilibrium structure determine it in detail for many classes off (p),
   including the cubic for frequency-independent selection. Numerical
   examples demonstrate that for suitable f (p), many equilibria can occur
   simultaneously. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The dynamics of long-term evolution in a complex genetically-structured
   population with a flux of random mutations is employed here to study the
   evolution of mutual altruism between relatives that are encountered
   repeatedly, where the level of altruism is measured by the risk one is
   willing to accept in order to save the life of one's relative. It is
   shown that regardless of the number of loci involved, of the rates of
   recombination among them, and of the intensity of the selection forces,
   the long-term dynamics can phenotypically converge only to a level of
   altruism that maximizes the individual inclusive fitness as it has
   previously defined by students of the individual approach to evolution.
   Except for the widely studied case of weak selection, however, the
   convergence to such a level of altruism is not necessarily
   generation-to-next monotone. It is further shown that, unlike the case
   of the one-shot encounter, repeated encounters between relatives allow
   for more than one level of altruism which may maximize the inclusive
   fitness, in which case not all such levels of altruism are
   evolutionarily accessible. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Stochasticity, heterogeneity, and variance in longevity in human
   populations},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {114},
Pages = {107-116},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Inter-individual variance in longevity (or any other demographic
   outcome) may arise from heterogeneity or from individual stochasticity.
   Heterogeneity refers to differences among individuals in the demographic
   rates experienced at a given age or stage. Stochasticity refers to
   variation due to the random outcome of demographic rates applied to
   individuals with the same properties. The variance due to individual
   stochasticity can be calculated from a Markov chain description of the
   life cycle. The variance due to heterogeneity can be calculated from a
   multistate model that incorporates the heterogeneity. We show how to use
   this approach to decompose the variance in longevity into contributions
   from stochasticity and heterogeneous frailty for male and female cohorts
   from Sweden (1751-1899), France (1816-1903), and Italy (1872-1899), and
   also for a selection of period data for the same countries.
   Heterogeneity in mortality is described by the gamma-Gompertz Makeham
   model, in which a gamma distributed ``frailty{''} modifies a baseline
   Gompertz Makeham mortality schedule. Model parameters were estimated by
   maximum likelihood for a range of starting ages. The estimates were used
   to construct an age x frailty-classified matrix model, from which we
   compute the variance of longevity and its components due to
   heterogeneous frailty and to individual stochasticity. The estimated
   fraction of the variance in longevity due to heterogeneous frailty
   (averaged over time) is less than 10\% for all countries and for both
   sexes. These results suggest that most of the variance in human
   longevity arises from stochasticity, rather than from heterogeneous
   frailty. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.},

Title = {Social evolution and genetic interactions in the short and long term},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {103},
Pages = {2-26},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The evolution of social traits remains one of the most fascinating and
   feisty topics in evolutionary biology even after half a century of
   theoretical research. W.D. Hamilton shaped much of the field initially
   with his 1964 papers that laid out the foundation for understanding the
   effect of genetic relatedness on the evolution of social behavior. Early
   theoretical investigations revealed two critical assumptions required
   for Hamilton's rule to hold in dynamical models: weak selection and
   additive genetic interactions. However, only recently have analytical
   approaches from population genetics and evolutionary game theory
   developed sufficiently so that social evolution can be studied under the
   joint action of selection, mutation, and genetic drift. We review how
   these approaches suggest two timescales for evolution under weak
   mutation: (i) a short-term timescale where evolution occurs between a
   finite set of alleles, and (ii) a long-term timescale where a continuum
   of alleles are possible and populations evolve continuously from one
   monomorphic trait to another. We show how Hamilton's rule emerges from
   the short-term analysis under additivity and how non-additive genetic
   interactions can be accounted for more generally. This short-term
   approach reproduces, synthesizes, and generalizes many previous results
   including the one-third law from evolutionary game theory and risk
   dominance from economic game theory. Using the long-term approach, we
   illustrate how trait evolution can be described with a diffusion
   equation that is a stochastic analogue of the canonical equation of
   adaptive dynamics. Peaks in the stationary distribution of the diffusion
   capture classic notions of convergence stability from evolutionary game
   theory and generally depend on the additive genetic interactions
   inherent in Hamilton's rule. Surprisingly, the peaks of the long-term
   stationary distribution can predict the effects of simple kinds of
   non-additive interactions. Additionally, the peaks capture both weak and
   strong effects of social payoffs in a manner difficult to replicate with
   the short-term approach. Together, the results from the short and
   long-term approaches suggest both how Hamilton's insight may be robust
   in unexpected ways and how current analytical approaches can expand our
   understanding of social evolution far beyond Hamilton's original work.

Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The formula for the probability of fixation of a new mutation is widely
   used in theoretical population genetics and molecular evolution. Here we
   derive a series of identities, inequalities and approximations for the
   exact probability of fixation of a new mutation under the Moran process
   (equivalent results hold for the approximate probability of fixation
   under the Wright-Fisher process, after an appropriate change of
   variables). We show that the logarithm of the fixation probability has
   particularly simple behavior when the selection coefficient is measured
   as a difference of Malthusian fitnesses, and we exploit this simplicity
   to derive inequalities and approximations. We also present a
   comprehensive comparison of both existing and new approximations for the
   fixation probability, highlighting those approximations that induce a
   reversible Markov chain when used to describe the dynamics of evolution
   under weak mutation. To demonstrate the power of these results, we
   consider the classical problem of determining the total substitution
   rate across an ensemble of biallelic loci and prove that, at
   equilibrium, a strict majority of substitutions are due to drift rather
   than selection. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Clines with partial panmixia in an environmental pocket},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {95},
Pages = {24-32},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {In geographically structured populations, global panmixia can be
   regarded as the limiting case of long-distance migration. The effect of
   incorporating partial panmixia into diallelic single-locus dines (i.e.,
   asymptotically stable equilibria) maintained by migration and selection
   in an isotropic environmental pocket in n dimensions is investigated.
   The population density is uniform. Migration and selection are both
   weak; the former is homogeneous and isotropic; the latter is
   directional. If the scaled panmictic rate beta >= 1, then the allele
   favored in the pocket is ultimately lost. For beta < 1, a dine is
   maintained if and only if the scaled radius a of the pocket exceeds a
   critical value a(n). For a step-environment without dominance, simple,
   explicit formulas are derived for a(1) and a(3); an equation with a
   unique solution and simple, explicit approximations are deduced for
   a(2). The ratio of the selection coefficients outside and inside the
   pocket is -alpha. As expected intuitively, the dine becomes more
   difficult to maintain; i.e., the critical radius a(n) increases for n =
   1, 2, 3,... as alpha, beta, or n increases. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All

Title = {The nest site lottery: How selectively neutral density dependent growth
   suppression induces frequency dependent selection},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {90},
Pages = {82-90},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Modern developments in population dynamics emphasize the role of the
   turnover of individuals. In the new approaches stable population size is
   a dynamic equilibrium between different mortality and fecundity factors
   instead of an arbitrary fixed carrying capacity. The latest replicator
   dynamics models assume that regulation of the population size acts
   through feedback driven by density dependent juvenile mortality. Here,
   we consider a simplified model to extract the properties of this
   approach. We show that at the stable population size, the structure of
   the frequency dependent evolutionary game emerges. Turnover of
   individuals induces a lottery mechanism where for each nest site
   released by a dead adult individual a single newborn is drawn from the
   pool of newborn candidates. This frequency dependent selection leads
   towards the strategy maximizing the number of newborns per adult death.
   However, multiple strategies can maximize this value. Among them, the
   strategy with the greatest mortality (which implies the greatest
   instantaneous growth rate) is selected. This result is important for the
   discussion about universal fitness measures and which parameters are
   maximized by natural selection. This is related to the fitness measures
   R-o and r, because the number of newborns per single dead individual
   equals the lifetime production of newborn R-o in models without aging.
   We thus have a two-stage procedure, instead of a single fitness measure,
   which is a combination of R-o and r. According to the nest site lottery
   mechanism, at stable population size, selection favors strategies with
   the greatest r, i.e. those with the highest turnover, from those with
   the greatest R-o.(c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Predator attack rate evolution in space: The role of ecology mediated by
   complex emergent spatial structure and self-shading},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {89},
Pages = {55-63},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Predation interactions are an important element of ecological
   communities. Population spatial structure has been shown to influence
   predator evolution, resulting in the evolution of a reduced predator
   attack rate; however, the evolutionary role of traits governing predator
   and prey ecology is unknown. The evolutionary effect of spatial
   structure on a predator's attack rate has primarily been explored
   assuming a fixed metapopulation spatial structure, and understood in
   terms of group selection. But endogenously generated, emergent spatial
   structure is common in nature. Furthermore, the evolutionary influence
   of ecological traits may be mediated through the spatial
   self-structuring process. Drawing from theory on pathogens, the
   evolutionary effect of emergent spatial structure can be understood in
   terms of self-shading, where a voracious predator limits its long-term
   invasion potential by reducing local prey availability. Here we
   formalize the effects of self-shading for predators using spatial moment
   equations. Then, through simulations, we show that in a spatial context
   self-shading leads to relationships between predator prey ecology and
   the predator's attack rate that are not expected in a non-spatial
   context. Some relationships are analogous to relationships already shown
   for host pathogen interactions, but others represent new trait
   dimensions. Finally, since understanding the effects of ecology using
   existing self-shading theory requires simplifications of the emergent
   spatial structure that do not apply well here, we also develop metrics
   describing the complex spatial structure of the predator and prey
   populations to help us explain the evolutionary effect of predator and
   prey ecology in the context of self-shading. The identification of these
   metrics may provide a step towards expansion of the predictive domain of
   self-shading theory to more complex spatial dynamics. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Title = {Eliminating infectious diseases of livestock: A metapopulation model of
   infection control},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {85},
Pages = {63-72},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {When novel disease outbreaks occur in livestock, policy makers must
   respond promptly to eliminate disease, and are typically called on to
   make control decisions before detailed analysis of disease parameters
   can be undertaken. We present a flexible metapopulation model of disease
   spread that incorporates variation in livestock density and includes
   occasional high-mixing locations or events, such as markets or race
   meetings. Using probability generating functions derived from this
   branching process model, we compare the likely success of reactive
   control strategies in eliminating disease spread. We find that the
   optimal vaccine strategy varies according to the disease transmission
   rate, with homogeneous vaccination most effective for low transmission
   rates, and heterogeneous vaccination preferable for high levels of
   transmission. Quarantine combines well with vaccination, with the chance
   of disease elimination enhanced even for vaccines with low efficacy.
   Control decisions surrounding horse race meetings were of particular
   concern during the 2007 outbreak of equine influenza in Australia. We
   show that this type of high-mixing event is a powerful spread mechanism,
   even when the proportion of time spent at such events is low. If such
   locations remain open, elimination will require a highly effective
   vaccine with high coverage. However, a policy of banning animals from
   quarantined regions from attending such events can provide an effective
   alternative if full closure of events is economically or politically
   untenable. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Reproductive value, sensitivity, and nonlinearity: Population-management
   heuristics derived from classical demography},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {85},

Abstract = {In classical demographic theory, reproductive value and stable age
   distribution are proportional to the sensitivities of the asymptotic
   population size to changes in mortality and maternity, respectively. In
   this note we point out that analogous relationships hold if the
   maternity function is allowed to depend on the population density. The
   relevant formulae can essentially be obtained by replacing the growth
   rate ({''}Lotka's r{''}) with zero. These facts may be used to derive
   heuristics for population management (pest control). (c) 2013 Elsevier

Title = {Caught in the middle: Asymmetric competition causes high variance in
   intermediate trait abundances},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {85},
Pages = {26-37},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {In asymmetric competition between two individuals of the same or
   different species, one individual has a distinct advantage over the
   other due to a particular beneficial trait. An important trait that
   induces asymmetric competition is size (body size in animals, height in
   plants). There is usually a trade-off between fecundity and the trait
   that leads to competitive superiority (e.g. seed number vs seed size),
   enabling coexistence of populations with different trait values. These
   predictions on coexistence are based on classic deterministic models.
   Here, we explore the behaviour of a stochastic model of asymmetric
   competition where stochasticity is assumed to be demographic. We derive
   approximations for the temporal variance and covariance of the
   population sizes of the coexisting species. The derivations highlight
   that the variability of the population size of a species strongly
   depends on the stochastic fluctuations of species with higher trait
   values, while they are less influenced by species with lower trait
   values. Particularly, species with intermediate trait values are
   strongly affected resulting in relatively high variability. As a result
   these species have a relative high probability of extinction even though
   they have a larger population size than species with high trait values.
   We confirm these approximations with individual-based simulations. Thus,
   our analysis can explain gaps in size distributions as an emergent
   property of systems with a fecundity-competition trade-off. (c) 2013

Title = {Stochastic modeling of Dalbulus maidis, vector of maize diseases},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {154},
Pages = {51-66},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {We developed a simple linear stochastic model for Dalbulus maidis
   dependent exclusively on temperature, whose parameters were determined
   from published field and laboratory studies performed at different
   temperatures. This model takes into account the principal stages and
   events of the life cycle of this pest, which is vector of maize
   diseases. We implemented the effect of distributed delays or Linear
   Chain Trick (LCT) considering a fixed number of sub-stages for egg and
   nymph stages of Dalbulus maidis in order to accurately represent what is
   observed in nature. A sensitivity analysis allows us to observe that the
   speed of the dynamics is sensitive to changes in the development rates,
   but not to the longevity of each stage or the fecundity, which almost
   exclusively affect insect abundance. We used our model to study its
   predictive and explanatory capacity considering a published experiment
   as a case study. Although the simulation results show a behavior
   qualitatively equivalent to that observed in the experimental results it
   is not possible to explain accurately the magnitude, nor the times in
   which the maximum abundances of second-generation nymphs and adults are
   reached. Therefore, we evaluated three possible scenarios for the insect
   that allow us to glimpse some of the advantages of having a
   computational model in order to find out what processes, taken into
   account in the model, may explain the differences observed between
   published experimental results and model results. The three proposed
   scenarios, based on variations in the parameterized rates of the model,
   can satisfactorily explain the experimental observations. We observed
   that in order to better simulate the experimental results it is not
   necessary to modify fecundity or mortality rates. However, it is
   necessary to accelerate the average development rates of our model by 20
   to 40 \%, compatible with extreme values of the rates close to the upper
   edges of the confidence bands of our parameterization rate curves,
   according to insects with faster development rates already reported in
   literature.(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {The role of spatial competitive interactions between trees in shaping
   forest patterns},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {142},
Pages = {36-45},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {General patterns that are observed in forests irrespective of their
   ecological biome or species composition are indicators of general
   biological processes that drive forest dynamics. Modelling can be used
   to infer these processes by identifying the minimum set of rules that
   generate the observed patterns. The regular spatial pattern of the
   largest trees, the decreasing skewness of the tree diameter distribution
   in young developing stands, and the size bimodality that may result from
   the tail of dominated trees are three general patterns observed in
   natural forests. Using a simple individual-based space-dependent growth
   model based on asymmetric competition between trees and
   space-independent approximations of this model, the objectives were (1)
   to identify a single mechanism that may explain these three patterns,
   and (2) to clarify the role of space in the emergence of these patterns.
   The space-dependent model was able to qualitatively generate the three
   patterns. Through cascading spatial interactions, competition resulted
   in the establishment of a spatially structured competitive hierarchy
   among trees. A second-order approximation of the space-dependent model
   was derived by structuring the population of trees according to diameter
   and competitive status. This second-order approximation succeeded in
   predicting left-skewed diameter distributions but did not predict
   diameter bimodality. Asymmetric competition thus seems to be an
   important driver of tree growth and the cause rather than the
   consequence of bimodality. The second-order approximation of the
   space-dependent model may be useful to generalize the stationary
   diameter distributions developed in the demographic equilibrium theory.

Title = {Coalescent models derived from birth-death processes},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {142},
Pages = {1-11},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {A coalescent model of a sample of size n is derived from a birth-death
   process that originates at a random time in the past from a single
   founder individual. Over time, the descendants of the founder evolve
   into a population of large (infinite) size from which a sample of size n
   is taken. The parameters and time of the birth-death process are scaled
   in N-0, the size of the present-day population, while letting N-0 ->
   infinity, similarly to how the standard Kingman coalescent process
   arises from the Wright-Fisher model. The model is named the Limit
   Birth-Death (LBD) coalescent model. Simulations from the LBD coalescent
   model with sample size n are computationally slow compared to standard
   coalescent models. Therefore, we suggest different approximations to the
   LBD coalescent model assuming the population size is a deterministic
   function of time rather than a stochastic process. Furthermore, we
   introduce a hybrid LBD coalescent model, that combines the exactness of
   the LBD coalescent model model with the speed of the approximations. (C)

Title = {The effect of consanguinity on coalescence times on the X chromosome},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {140},
Pages = {32-43},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Consanguineous unions increase the frequency at which identical genomic
   segments are inherited along separate paths of descent, decreasing
   coalescence times for pairs of alleles drawn from an individual who is
   the offspring of a consanguineous pair. For an autosomal locus, it has
   recently been shown that the mean time to the most recent common
   ancestor (TMRCA) for two alleles in the same individual and the mean
   TMRCA for two alleles in two separate individuals both decrease with
   increasing consanguinity in a population. Here, we extend this analysis
   to the X chromosome, considering X-chromosomal coalescence times under a
   coalescent model with diploid, male-female mating pairs. We examine four
   possible first-cousin mating schemes that are equivalent in their
   effects on autosomes, but that have differing effects on the X
   chromosome: patrilateral-parallel, patrilateralcross,
   matrilateral-parallel, and matrilateral-cross. In each mating model, we
   calculate mean TMRCA for X-chromosomal alleles sampled either within or
   between individuals. We describe a consanguinity effect on X-chromosomal
   TMRCA that differs from the autosomal pattern under matrilateral but not
   under patrilateral first-cousin mating. For matrilateral first cousins,
   the effect of consanguinity in reducing TMRCA is stronger on the X
   chromosome than on the autosomes, with an increased effect of
   parallel-cousin mating compared to cross-cousin mating. The theoretical
   computations support the utility of the model in understanding patterns
   of genomic sharing on the X chromosome. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All

   Kingman coalescent, its time-changed counterpart describing so-called
   weak seed banks, the strong seed bank coalescent, and the two-island
   structured coalescent. As (strong) seed banks stratify a population, we
   expect them to produce a signal comparable to population structure. We
   present tractable formulas for Wright's F-ST and the expected site
   frequency spectrum for these models, and show that they can distinguish
   between some models for certain ranges of parameters. We then use
   pseudo-marginal MCMC to show that the full likelihood can reliably
   distinguish between all models in the presence of parameter uncertainty
   under moderate stratification, and point out statistical pitfalls
   arising from stratification that is either too strong or too weak. We
   further show that it is possible to infer parameters, and in particular
   determine whether mutation is taking place in the (strong) seed bank.

Title = {Modeling and control of mosquito-borne diseases with <i>Wolbachia</i>
   and insecticides},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Mosquitoes cause more human suffering than any other organism. It is
   estimated that over one million people worldwide die from mosquito-borne
   diseases every year. With the continuous efforts of many researchers,
   Wolbachia gets more and more attention due to its characteristics of
   maternal transmission in mosquito population and it may cause
   cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) which makes healthy females cannot
   fertilize normally after mating with infected males. In this paper,
   mathematical models are established to study Wolbachia transmission in
   mosquito population, and integrated mosquito control strategies are
   explored. Firstly, a classical ordinary differential system with general
   birth and death rate functions is established to describe the maternal
   transmission and CI effect. It is shown that the replacement strategy
   that the Wolbachia-uninfected mosquitoes are replaced by the infected
   ones is determined by the initial infection frequency. And Wolbachia
   spreads more easily for greater maternal transmission and CI rate.
   Moreover, all the wild mosquitoes will eventually be infected with
   Wolbachia if the maternal transmission is complete. Secondly, an
   impulsive state feedback control model is constructed to describe the
   integrated mosquito control. Besides Wolbachia, insecticides are sprayed
   when the quantity of mosquitoes reaches some Economic Threshold. The
   existence and stability of Wolbachia replacement periodic solution are
   discussed. Finally, some discussions are done and the future research
   directions are prospected. Keywords: Mosquito-borne diseases Wolbachia

Title = {Fast likelihood calculation for multivariate Gaussian phylogenetic
   models with shifts},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {131},
Pages = {66-78},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Phylogenetic comparative methods (PCMs) have been used to study the
   evolution of quantitative traits in various groups of organisms, ranging
   from micro-organisms to animal and plant species. A common approach has
   been to assume a Gaussian phylogenetic model for the trait evolution
   along the tree, such as a branching Brownian motion (BM) or an
   Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process. Then, the parameters of the process
   have been inferred based on a given tree and trait data for the sampled
   species. At the heart of this inference lie multiple calculations of the
   model likelihood, that is, the probability density of the observed trait
   data, conditional on the model parameters and the tree. With the
   increasing availability of big phylogenetic trees, spanning hundreds to
   several thousand sampled species, this approach is facing a two-fold
   challenge. First, the assumption of a single Gaussian process governing
   the entire tree is not adequate in the presence of heterogeneous
   evolutionary forces acting in different parts of the tree. Second, big
   trees present a computational challenge, due to the time and memory
   complexity of the model likelihood calculation.
   Here, we explore a sub-family, denoted G(LInv) , of the Gaussian
   phylogenetic models, with the transition density exhibiting the
   properties that the expectation depends Linearly on the ancestral trait
   value and the variance is Invariant with respect to the ancestral value.
   We show that G(LInv), contains the vast majority of Gaussian models
   currently used in PCMs, while supporting an efficient (linear in the
   number of nodes) algorithm for the likelihood calculation. The algorithm
   supports scenarios with missing data, as well as different types of
   trees, including trees with polytomies and non-ultrametric trees. To
   account for the heterogeneity in the evolutionary forces, the algorithm
   supports models with ``shifts{''} occurring at specific points in the
   tree. Such shifts can include changes in some or all parameters, as well
   as the type of the model, provided that the model remains within the
   G(LInv) family. This contrasts with most of the current implementations
   where, due to slow likelihood calculation, the shifts are restricted to
   specific parameters in a single type of model, such as the long-term
   selection optima of an OU process, assuming that all of its other
   parameters, such as evolutionary rate and selection strength, are global
   for the entire tree.
   We provide an implementation of this likelihood calculation algorithm in
   an accompanying R-package called PCMBase. The package has been designed
   as a generic library that can be integrated with existing or novel
   maximum likelihood or Bayesian inference tools. (C) 2019 The Author(s).

Title = {Selection in two-sex stage-structured populations: Genetics, demography,
   and polymorphism},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {130},
Pages = {160-169},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The outcome of natural selection depends on the demographic processes of
   birth, death, and development. Here, we derive conditions for protected
   polymorphism in a population characterized by age- or stage-dependent
   demography with two sexes. We do so using a novel two-sex matrix
   population model including basic Mendelian genetics (one locus, two
   alleles, random mating). Selection may operate on survival, growth, or
   fertility, any or all of which may differ between the sexes. The model
   can therefore incorporate genes with arbitrary pleiotropic and
   sex-specific effects. Conditions for protected polymorphism are
   expressed in terms of the eigenvalues of the linearization of the model
   at the homozygote boundary equilibria. We show that in the absence of
   sexual dimorphism, polymorphism requires heterozygote superiority in the
   genotypic population growth rate. In the presence of sexual dimorphism,
   however, heterozygote superiority is not required; an inferior
   heterozygote may invade, reducing the population growth rate and even
   leading to extinction (so-called evolutionary suicide). Our model makes
   no assumptions about separation of time scales between ecological and
   evolutionary processes, and can thus be used to project sex x stage x
   genotype dynamics of eco-evolutionary processes. Empirical evidence that
   sexual dimorphism affects extinction risk is growing, yet sex
   differences are often ignored in evolutionary demography and in
   eco-evolutionary models. Our analysis highlights the importance of
   sexual dimorphism and suggests mechanisms by which an allele can be
   favored by selection, yet drive a population to extinction, as a result
   of the structure and interdependence of sex- and stage-specific
   processes. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.},

Abstract = {Advances in structural biology of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs)
   have revealed incredible diversity in how aaRSs bind their tRNA
   substrates. The causes of this diversity remain mysterious. We developed
   a new class of highly rugged fitness landscape models called match
   landscapes, through which genes encode the assortative interactions of
   their gene products through the complementarity and identifiability of
   their structural features. We used results from coding theory to prove
   bounds and equalities on fitness in match landscapes assuming additive
   interaction energies, macroscopic aminoacylation kinetics including
   proofreading, site-specific modifiers of interaction, and selection for
   translational accuracy in multiple, perfectly encoded site-types. Using
   genotypes based on extended Hamming codes we show that over a wide array
   of interface sizes and numbers of encoded cognate pairs, selection for
   translational accuracy alone is insufficient to displace the
   tRNA-binding interfaces of aaRSs. Yet, under combined selection for
   translational accuracy and rate, site-specific modifiers are selected to
   adaptively displace the tRNA-binding interfaces of non-cognate aaRS-tRNA
   pairs. We describe a remarkable correspondence between the lengths of
   perfect RNA (quaternary) codes and the modal sizes of small non-coding
   RNA families. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. This is

Title = {The effect of harvesting on the spatial synchrony of population
   fluctuations},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {123},
Pages = {28-34},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Harvesting in space affects, in general, the spatial scale of the
   synchrony in the population fluctuations, which determines the size of
   the areas subjected to simultaneous quasi-extinction risk. Here we show
   that harvesting reduces the population synchrony scale if it depends
   more strongly on population fluctuations than the density dependence of
   the growth rate in the absence of harvesting. We show that constant and
   proportional harvesting always increases the spatial scale, using a
   theta-logistic model for density regulation. We also provide exact
   scaling results under harvesting for the Beverton-Holt and the Ricker
   stock-recruitment models that are commonly applied, e.g. in fisheries.
   Our results indicate that harvest in areas with large abundances should
   be encouraged to avoid increase of the spatial scale of synchrony in the
   population fluctuations that can lead to unexpected quasi-extinction of
   populations over large areas. Our results quantify this harvesting
   impact giving the resulting scales of spatial synchrony of population
   fluctuations. This emphasizes the importance of estimating the form of
   density dependence as well as the dependency of harvest upon population
   density of exploited populations, in order to get reliable predictions
   of the size of areas that can undergo simultaneous quasi-extinction. (C)

Title = {Population structure and coalescence in pedigrees: Comparisons to the
   structured coalescent and a framework for inference},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {115},
Pages = {1-12},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Contrary to what is often assumed in population genetics, independently
   segregating loci do not have completely independent ancestries, since
   all loci are inherited through a single, shared population pedigree.
   Previous work has shown that the non-independence between gene
   genealogies of independently segregating loci created by the population
   pedigree is weak in panmictic populations, and predictions made from
   standard coalescent theory are accurate for populations that are at
   least moderately sized. Here, we investigate patterns of coalescence in
   pedigrees of structured populations. We find that the pedigree creates
   deviations away from the predictions of the structured coalescent that
   persist on a longer timescale than in the case of panmictic populations.
   Nevertheless, we find that the structured coalescent provides a
   reasonable approximation for the coalescent process in structured
   population pedigrees so long as migration events are moderately frequent
   and there are no migration events in the recent pedigree of the sample.
   When there are migration events in the recent sample pedigree, we find
   that distributions of coalescence in the sample can be modeled as a
   mixture of distributions from different initial sample configurations.
   We use this observation to motivate a maximum-likelihood approach for
   inferring migration rates and mutation rates jointly with features of
   the pedigree such as recent migrant ancestry and recent relatedness.
   Using simulation, we show that our inference framework accurately
   recovers long-term migration rates in the presence of recent migration
   events in the sample pedigree. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {Modeling ephemeral mating encounters in insects: The emergence of

Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {104},
Pages = {10-16},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Lack of successful mating encounters in two-sex insect populations is a
   mechanism that might trigger reproductive Allee effects. In this paper I
   examine a function that models ephemeral mating encounters through the
   expected density of pairs formed by individuals of both sexes at any
   time. When this function is incorporated in a general system of
   differential equations for a two-sex population the solutions exhibit
   the emergence of an Allee effect for low population densities. Compared
   with current conceptual models for mate-finding Allee effects, the
   proposed pairing function does not include a parameter that quantifies
   the Allee effect strength, a feature that might be useful when
   information to parameterize Allee effects is unavailable. The mating
   function is then used to numerically explore how mate-finding Allee
   effects are enhanced by the release of sterile males in theoretical
   models where (i) the initial sex ratio is skewed, (ii) sterile males are
   released in pulses and (iii) partial female remating is allowed. (C)

Title = {Dying on the way: The influence of migrational mortality on neutral
   models of spatial variation},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {99},
Pages = {67-75},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Migrational mortality is introduced into the classical Malecot model for
   migration, mutation, and random genetic drift. To assess the influence
   of mortality, its effect on the backward migration rates and on the
   probabilities of identity in allelic state are studied. Perhaps
   surprisingly, some of the former may increase, but as is intuitive,
   their sum always decreases. As expected, in the island model, mortality
   does not change the migration pattern, but it decreases the migration
   rate. Furthermore, it decreases the expected heterozygosity, but
   increases the genetic diversity and differentiation. The circular
   habitat and the unbounded, linear stepping-stone model also illustrate
   the general results. Arbitrary migration is also analyzed. If migration
   is sufficiently weak, then mortality diminishes every migration rate; it
   decreases the expected heterozygosity and the genetic similarity between
   demes. In the strong-migration limit, mortality may raise or lower the
   probability of identity in state. Perhaps unexpectedly, under mild and
   reasonable biological assumptions, mortality does not alter the
   diffusion limit of the probabilities of identity. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Title = {Replicating disease spread in empirical cattle networks by adjusting the
   probability of infection in random networks},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {98},
Pages = {11-18},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Comparisons between mass-action or ``random{''} network models and
   empirical networks have produced mixed results. Here we seek to discover
   whether a simulated disease spread through randomly constructed networks
   can be coerced to model the spread in empirical networks by altering a
   single disease parameter - the probability of infection. A stochastic
   model for disease spread through herds of cattle is utilised to model
   the passage of an SEIR (susceptible-latent-infected-resistant) through
   five networks. The first network is an empirical network of recorded
   contacts, from four datasets available, and the other four networks are
   constructed from randomly distributed contacts based on increasing
   amounts of information from the recorded network, A numerical study on
   adjusting the value of the probability of infection was conducted for
   the four random network models. We found that relative percentage
   reductions in the probability of infection, between 5.6\% and 39.4\% in
   the random network models, produced results that most closely mirrored
   the results from the empirical contact networks. In all cases tested, to
   reduce the differences between the two models, required a reduction in
   the probability of infection in the random network. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Title = {On the retention of gene duplicates prone to dominant deleterious
   mutations},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {93},
Pages = {38-51},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Recent studies have shown that gene families from different functional
   categories have been preferentially expanded either by small scale
   duplication (SSD) or by whole-genome duplication (WGD). In particular,
   gene families prone to dominant deleterious mutations and implicated in
   cancers and other genetic diseases in human have been greatly expanded
   through two rounds of WGD dating back from early vertebrates. Here, we
   strengthen this intriguing observation, showing that human oncogenes
   involved in different primary tumors have retained many WGD duplicates
   compared to other human genes. In order to rationalize this evolutionary
   outcome, we propose a consistent population genetics model to analyze
   the retention of SSD and WGD duplicates taking into account their
   propensity to acquire dominant deleterious mutations. We solve a
   deterministic haploid model including initial duplicated loci, their
   retention through sub-functionalization or their neutral
   loss-of-function or deleterious gain-of-function at one locus.
   Extensions to diploid genotypes are presented and population size
   effects, are analyzed using stochastic simulations. The only difference
   between the SSD and WGD scenarios is the initial number of individuals
   with duplicated loci. While SSD duplicates need to spread through the
   entire population from a single individual to reach fixation, WGD
   duplicates are de facto fixed in the small initial post-WGD population
   arising through the ploidy incompatibility between post-WGD individuals
   and the rest of the pre-WGD population. WGD duplicates prone to dominant
   deleterious mutations are then shown to be indirectly selected through
   purifying selection in post-WGD species, whereas SSD duplicates
   typically require positive selection. These results highlight the
   long-term evolution mechanisms behind the surprising accumulation of WGD
   duplicates prone to dominant deleterious mutations and are shown to be
   consistent with cancer genome data on the prevalence of human oncogenes
   with WGD duplicates. (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Bounds on the dynamics of sink populations with noisy immigration},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {92},
Pages = {88-96},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Sink populations are doomed to decline to extinction in the absence of
   immigration. The dynamics of sink populations are not easily modelled
   using the standard framework of per capita rates of immigration, because
   numbers of immigrants are determined by extrinsic sources (for example,
   source populations, or population managers). Here we appeal to a systems
   and control framework to place upper and lower bounds on both the
   transient and future dynamics of sink populations that are subject to
   noisy immigration. Immigration has a number of interpretations and can
   fit a wide variety of models found in the literature. We apply the
   results to case studies derived from published models for Chinook salmon
   (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and blowout penstemon (Penstemon haydenii).

Title = {Birth-death models and coalescent point processes: The shape and
   probability of reconstructed phylogenies},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {90},
Pages = {113-128},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Forward-in-time models of diversification (i.e., speciation and
   extinction) produce phylogenetic trees that grow ``vertically{''} as
   time goes by. Pruning the extinct lineages out of such trees leads to
   natural models for reconstructed trees (i.e., phylogenies of extant
   species). Alternatively, reconstructed trees can be modelled by
   coalescent point processes (CPPs), where trees grow ``horizontally{''}
   by the sequential addition of vertical edges. Each new edge starts at
   some random speciation time and ends at the present time; speciation
   times are drawn from the same distribution independently. CPPs lead to
   extremely fast computation of tree likelihoods and simulation of
   reconstructed trees. Their topology always follows the uniform
   distribution on ranked tree shapes (URT).
   We characterize which forward-in-time models lead to URT reconstructed
   trees and among these, which lead to CPP reconstructed trees. We show
   that for any ``asymmetric{''} diversification model in which speciation
   rates only depend on time and extinction rates only depend on time and
   on a non-heritable trait (e.g., age), the reconstructed tree is CPP,
   even if extant species are incompletely sampled. If rates additionally
   depend on the number of species, the reconstructed tree is (only) URT
   (but not CPP). We characterize the common distribution of speciation
   times in the CPP description, and discuss incomplete species sampling as
   well as three special model cases in detail: (1) the extinction rate
   does not depend on a trait; (2) rates do not depend on time; (3) mass
   extinctions may happen additionally at certain points in the past. (c)

Title = {Coexistence of structured populations with size-based prey selection},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {89},
Pages = {24-33},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Species with a large adult offspring size ratio and a preferred predator
   prey mass ratio undergo ontogenetic trophic niche shift(s) throughout
   life. Trophic interactions between such species vary throughout life,
   resulting in different species-level interaction motifs depending on the
   maximum adult sizes and population size distributions. We explore the
   assembly and potential for coexistence of small communities where all
   species experience ontogenetic trophic niche shifts. The life-history of
   each species is described by a physiologically structured model and
   species identity is characterised by the trait: size at maturation. We
   show that a single species can exist in two different states: a
   `resource driven state' and a `cannibalistic state' with a large scope
   for emergent Allee effects and bistable states. Two species can coexist
   in two different configurations: in a `competitive coexistence' state
   when the ratio between sizes at maturation of the two species is less
   than a predator prey mass ratio and the resource level is low to
   intermediate, or in a `trophic ladder' state if the ratio of sizes at
   maturation is larger than the predator prey mass ratio at all resource
   levels. While there is a large scope for coexistence of two species, the
   scope for coexistence of three species is limited and we conclude that
   further trait differentiation is required for coexistence of more
   species-rich size-structured communities. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All

Volume = {87},
Pages = {5-14},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {We study the asymptotics of the extended Moran model as the total

   provided, the first result leading to discrete-time limiting coalescent
   processes and the second result leading to continuous-time limiting
   coalescent processes. The limiting coalescent processes allow for
   multiple mergers of ancestral lineages (Lambda-coalescent). It is
   furthermore verified that any continuous time Lambda-coalescent (with
   Lambda any probability distribution) can arise in the limit. Typical
   examples of extended Moran models are discussed, with an emphasis on
   models being in the domain of attraction of beta coalescents or
   Lambda-coalescents with Lambda being log infinitely divisible. (c) 2011

Title = {Exploring epiallele stability in a population-epigenetic model},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {83},
Pages = {136-144},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Differences in transgenerational epigenetic stability can result in a
   diversity of phenotypes among genetically identical individuals. Here we
   present a model that encapsulates non-genomic phenotypic variation in a
   population over two distinct environments that each act as a stimulus
   for epigenetic modification. By allowing different levels of epigenetic
   resetting, thereby increasing epigenetic diversity, we explore the
   dynamics of multiple epiallelic states subject to selection in a
   population-epigenetic model. We find that both epigenetic resetting and
   the environmental frequency are crucial parameters in this system. Our
   results illustrate the regions of parameter space that enable up to
   three equilibria to be simultaneously locally stable. Furthermore, it is
   clear that both continued environmental induction and epigenetic
   resetting prevent epigenetic fixation, maintaining phenotypic variation
   through different epiallelic states. However, unless both environments
   are reasonably common, levels of epigenetically-maintained variation are
   low. We argue that it is vital that non-genomic phenotypic diversity is
   not ignored in evolutionary theory, but instead regarded as distinct
   epiallelic variants. Ultimately, a critical goal of future experiments
   should be to determine accurate rates of epigenetic resetting,
   especially over several generations, in order to establish the long-term
   significance of epigenetic inheritance. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All

Title = {The impact of dormancy on evolutionary branching},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {156},
Pages = {66-76},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {this paper, we investigate the consequences of dormancy in the `rare
   mutation' and `large population' regime of stochastic adaptive dynamics.
   Starting from an individual -based micro -model, we first derive the
   Polymorphic Evolution Sequence of the population, based on a previous
   work by Baar and Bovier (2018). After passing to a second `small
   mutations' limit, we arrive at the Canonical Equation of Adaptive
   Dynamics, and state a corresponding criterion for evolutionary
   branching, extending a previous result of Champagnat and Meleard (2011).
   The criterion allows a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the
   effects of dormancy in the well-known model of Dieckmann and Doebeli
   (1999) for sympatric speciation. In fact, quite an intuitive picture
   emerges: Dormancy enlarges the parameter range for evolutionary
   branching, increases the carrying capacity and niche width of the post
   -branching sub -populations, and, depending on the model parameters, can
   either increase decrease the `speed of adaptation' of populations.
   Finally, dormancy increases diversity by increasing the genetic distance
   between subpopulations.},

Title = {Assessing mutualistic metacommunity capacity by integrating spatial and
   interaction networks},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {156},
Pages = {22-39},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {We develop a spatially realistic model of mutualistic metacommunities
   that exploits the joint structure of spatial and interaction networks.
   Assuming that all species have the same colonisation and extinction
   parameters, this model exhibits a sharp transition between stable non
   -null equilibrium states and a global extinction state. This behaviour
   allows defining a threshold on colonisation/extinction parameters for
   the long-term metacommunity persistence. This threshold, the
   `metacommunity capacity', extends the metapopulation capacity concept
   and can be calculated from the spatial and interaction networks without
   needing to simulate the whole dynamics. In several applications we
   illustrate how the joint structure of the spatial and the interaction
   networks affects metacommunity capacity. It results that a weakly
   modular spatial network and a power -law degree distribution of the
   interaction network provide the most favourable configuration for the
   long-term persistence of a mutualistic metacommunity. Our model that
   encodes several explicit ecological assumptions should pave the way for
   a larger exploration of spatially realistic metacommunity models
   involving multiple interaction types.},

Title = {Continuous irregular dynamics with multiple neutral trajectories permit
   species coexistence in competitive communities},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {149},
Pages = {39-47},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The colonization model formulates competition among propagules for
   habitable sites to colonize, which serves as a mechanism enabling
   coexistence of multiple species. This model traditionally assumes that
   encounters between propagules and sites occur as mass action events,
   under which species distribution can eventually reach an equilibrium
   state with multiple species in a constant environment. To investigate
   the effects of encounter mode on species diversity, we analyzed
   community dynamics in the colonization model by varying encounter
   processes. The analysis indicated that equilibrium is approximately
   neutrally-stable under perfect ratio-dependent encounter, resulting in
   temporally con-tinuous variation of species' frequencies with irregular
   trajectories even under a constant environment. Although the
   trajectories significantly depend on initial conditions, they are
   considered to be ``strange nonchaotic attractors{''}(SNAs) rather than
   chaos from the asymptotic growth rates of displacement. In addition,
   trajectories with different initial conditions remain different through
   time, indicating that the system involves an infinite number of SNAs.
   This analysis presents a novel mechanism for transient dynamics under
   competition. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

   advantage},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {146},
Pages = {61-70},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The egalitarian allotment of gametes to each allele at a locus (Mendel's
   law of segregation) is a near-universal phenomenon characterizing
   inheritance in sexual populations. As exceptions to Mendel's law are
   known to occur, one can investigate why non-Mendelian segregation is not
   more common using modifier theory. Earlier work assuming sex-independent
   modifier effects in a random mating population with heterozygote
   advantage concluded that equal segregation is stable over long-term
   evolution. Subsequent investigation, however, demonstrated that the
   stability of the Mendelian scheme disappears when sex-specific modifier
   effects are allowed. Here I derive invasion conditions favoring the
   repeal of Mendelian law in mixed and obligate selfing populations.
   Oppositely-directed segregation distortion in the production of male and
   female gametes is selected for in the presence of overdominant fitness.
   The conditions are less restrictive than under panmixia in that strong
   selection can occur even without differential viability of reciprocal
   heterozygotes (i.e. in the absence of parent-of-origin effects at the
   overdominant fitness locus). Generalized equilibria are derived for full
   selfing. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The majority of population genetic theory assumes fully haploid or
   diploid organisms with obligate sexuality, despite complex life cycles
   with alternating generations being commonly observed. To reveal how
   natural selection and genetic drift shape the evolution of
   haploid-diploid populations, we analyze a stochastic genetic model for
   populations that consist of a mixture of haploid and diploid
   individuals, allowing for asexual reproduction and niche separation
   between haploid and diploid stages. Applying a diffusion approximation,
   we derive the fixation probability and describe its dependence on the
   reproductive values of haploid and diploid stages, which depend strongly
   on the extent of asexual reproduction in each phase and on the
   ecological differences between them. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights

   model of a consanguineous population},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {139},
Pages = {50-65},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Recent modeling studies interested in runs of homozygosity (ROH) and
   identity by descent (IBD) have sought to connect these properties of
   genomic sharing to pairwise coalescence times. Here, we examine a
   variety of features of pairwise coalescence times in models that
   consider consanguinity. In particular, we extend a recent diploid
   analysis of mean coalescence times for lineage pairs within and between
   individuals in a consanguineous population to derive the variance of
   coalescence times, studying its dependence on the frequency of
   consanguinity and the kinship coefficient of consanguineous
   relationships. We also introduce a separation-of-time-scales approach
   that treats consanguinity models analogously to mathematically similar
   phenomena such as partial selfing, using this approach to obtain
   coalescence-time distributions. This approach shows that the
   consanguinity model behaves similarly to a standard coalescent, scaling
   population size by a factor 1 - 3c, where c represents the kinship
   coefficient of a randomly chosen mating pair. It provides the
   explanation for an earlier result describing mean coalescence time in
   the consanguinity model in terms of c. The results extend the potential
   to make predictions about ROH and IBD in relation to demographic
   parameters of diploid populations. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {The interplay of dormancy and transfer in bacterial populations:
   Invasion, fixation and coexistence regimes},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {139},
Pages = {18-49},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In this paper we investigate the interplay between two fundamental
   mechanisms of microbial population dynamics and evolution, namely
   dormancy and horizontal gene transfer. The corresponding traits come in
   many guises and are ubiquitous in microbial communities, affecting their
   dynamics in important ways. Recently, they have each moved (separately)
   into the focus of stochastic individual-based modelling (Billiard et al.
   2016, 2018; Champagnat, Meleard and Tran, 2021; Blath and Tobias 2020).
   Here, we investigate their combined effects in a unified model. Indeed,
   we consider the (idealized) scenario of two sub-populations,
   respectively carrying `trait 1' and `trait 2', where trait 1 individuals
   are able to switch (under competitive pressure) into a dormant state,
   and trait 2 individuals are able to execute horizontal gene transfer,
   which in our case means that they can turn trait 1 individuals into
   trait 2 ones, at a rate depending on the density of individuals.
   In the large-population limit, we examine the fate of (i) a single trait
   2 individual (called `mutant') arriving in a trait 1 resident population
   living in equilibrium, and (ii) a trait 1 individual ('mutant') arriving
   in a trait 2 resident population. We analyse the invasion dynamics in
   all cases where the resident population is individually fit and the
   behaviour of the mutant population is initially non-critical. This leads
   to the identification of parameter regimes for the invasion and fixation
   of the new trait, stable coexistence of the two traits, and `founder
   control' (where the initial resident always dominates, irrespective of
   its trait).
   One of our key findings is that horizontal transfer can lead to stable
   coexistence even if trait 2 is unfit on its own. In the case of founder
   control, the limiting dynamical system also exhibits a coexistence
   equilibrium, which, however, is unstable, and with overwhelming
   probability none of the mutant sub-populations is able to invade. In all
   cases, we observe the classical (up to three) phases of invasion
   dynamics a la Champagnat (2006). (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights

   in the multispecies coalescent},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {137},
Pages = {22-31},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The multispecies coalescent process models the genealogical
   relationships of genes sampled from several species, enabling useful
   predictions about phenomena such as the discordance between a gene tree
   and the species phylogeny due to incomplete lineage sorting. Conversely,
   knowledge of large collections of gene trees can inform us about several
   aspects of the species phylogeny, such as its topology and ancestral
   population sizes. A fundamental open problem in this context is how to
   efficiently compute the probability of a gene tree topology, given the
   species phylogeny. Although a number of algorithms for this task have
   been proposed, they either produce approximate results, or, when they
   are exact, they do not scale to large data sets. In this paper, we
   present some progress towards exact and efficient computation of the
   probability of a gene tree topology. We provide a new algorithm that,
   given a species tree and the number of genes sampled for each species,
   calculates the probability that the gene tree topology will be
   concordant with the species tree. Moreover, we provide an algorithm that
   computes the probability of any specific gene tree topology concordant
   with the species tree. Both algorithms run in polynomial time and have
   been implemented in Python. Experiments show that they are able to
   analyze data sets where thousands of genes are sampled in a matter of
   minutes to hours. (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {135},
Pages = {32-48},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Resistance to insecticide is considered nowadays one of the major
   threats to insect control, as its occurrence reduces drastically the
   efficiency of chemical control campaigns, and may also perturb the
   application of other control methods, like biological and genetic
   control. In order to account for the emergence and spread of such
   phenomenon as an effect of exposition to larvicide and/or adulticide, we
   develop in this paper a general time-continuous population model with
   two life phases, subsequently simplified through slow manifold theory.
   The derived models present density-dependent recruitment and mortality
   rates in a non-conventional way. We show that in absence of selection,
   they evolve in compliance with Hardy-Weinberg law; while in presence of
   selection and in the dominant or codominant cases, convergence to the
   fittest genotype occurs. The proposed mathematical models should allow
   for the study of several issues of importance related to the use of
   insecticides and other adaptive phenomena. (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All

Title = {Assortative mating by population of origin in a mechanistic model of
   admixture},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {134},
Pages = {129-146},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Populations whose mating pairs have levels of similarity in phenotypes
   or genotypes that differ systematically from the level expected under
   random mating are described as experiencing assortative mating. Excess
   similarity in mating pairs is termed positive assortative mating, and
   excess dissimilarity is negative assortative mating. In humans,
   empirical studies suggest that mating pairs from various admixed
   populations - whose ancestry derives from two or more source populations
   - possess correlated ancestry components that indicate the occurrence of
   positive assortative mating on the basis of ancestry. Generalizing a
   two-sex mechanistic admixture model, we devise a model of one form of
   ancestry-assortative mating that occurs through preferential mating
   based on source population. Under the model, we study the moments of the
   admixture fraction distribution for different assumptions about mating
   preferences, including both positive and negative assortative mating by
   population. We demonstrate that whereas the mean admixture under
   assortative mating is equivalent to that of a corresponding randomly
   mating population, the variance of admixture depends on the level and
   direction of assortative mating. We consider two special cases of
   assortative mating by population: first, a single admixture event, and
   second, constant contributions to the admixed population over time. In
   contrast to standard settings in which positive assortment increases
   variation within a population, certain assortative mating scenarios
   allow the variance of admixture to decrease relative to a corresponding
   randomly mating population: with the three populations we consider, the
   variance-increasing effect of positive assortative mating within a
   population might be overwhelmed by a variance-decreasing effect emerging
   from mating preferences involving other pairs of populations. The effect
   of assortative mating is smaller on the X chromosome than on the
   autosomes because inheritance of the X in males depends only on the
   mother's ancestry, not on the mating pair. Because the variance of
   admixture is informative about the timing of admixture and possibly
   about sex-biased admixture contributions, the effects of assortative
   mating are important to consider in inferring features of population
   history from distributions of admixture values. Our model provides a
   framework to quantitatively study assortative mating under flexible
   scenarios of admixture over time. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {Modeling the dispersal-reproduction trade-off in an expanding population},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {134},
Pages = {147-159},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Trade-offs between dispersal and reproduction are known to be important
   drivers of population dynamics, but their direct influence on the
   spreading speed of a population is not well understood. Using
   integrodifference equations, we develop a model that incorporates a
   dispersal-reproduction trade-off which allows for a variety of different
   shaped trade-off curves. We show there is a unique
   reproductive-dispersal allocation that gives the largest value for the
   spreading speed and calculate the sensitivities of the reproduction,
   dispersal, and trade-off shape parameters. Uncertainty in the model
   parameters affects the expected spread of the population and we
   calculate the optimal allocation of resources to dispersal that
   maximizes the expected spreading speed. Higher allocation to dispersal
   arises from uncertainty in the reproduction parameter or the shape of
   the reproduction trade-off curve. Lower allocation to dispersal arises
   from uncertainty in the shape of the dispersal trade-off curve, but does
   not come from uncertainty in the dispersal parameter. Our findings give
   insight into how parameter sensitivity and uncertainty influence the
   spreading speed of a population with a dispersal-reproduction trade-off.

Title = {Strategies of host resistance to pathogens in spatially structured
   populations: An agent-based evaluation},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {130},
Pages = {170-181},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {There is growing theoretical evidence that spatial structure can affect
   the ecological and evolutionary outcomes of host-parasite interactions.
   Locally restricted interactions have been shown in particular to affect
   host resistance and tolerance. In this study we investigate the
   evolution of several types of host disease resistance strategies, alone
   or in combination, in spatially structured populations. We construct a
   spatially explicit, individual-based stochastic model where hosts and
   parasites interact with each other in a spatial lattice, and
   interactions are restricted to a given neighbourhood of varying size. We
   investigate several host resistance strategies, including constitutive
   (expressed in all resistant hosts), induced (expressed only upon
   infection), and combinations thereof. We show that a costly constitutive
   resistance cannot reach fixation, whereas an inducible resistance
   strategy may become fixed in the population if the cost remains low,
   particularly if it impacts host recovery. We also demonstrate that mixed
   strategies can be maintained in the host population, and that a higher
   investment in a recovery-boosting inducible resistance allows for a
   higher investment in a constitutive response. Our simulations reveal
   that the spatial structure of the population impacts the selection for
   resistance in a complex fashion. While single strategies of resistance
   are generally favoured in less structured populations, mixed strategies
   can sometimes prevail only in highly structured environments, e.g. when
   combining constitutive and transmission-blocking induced responses
   Overall these results shed new light on the dynamics of disease
   resistance in a spatially-structured host-pathogen system, and advance
   our theoretical understanding of the evolutionary dynamics of disease
   resistance, a necessary step to elaborate more efficient and sustainable
   strategies for disease management. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {The opportunity cost of walking away in the spatial iterated prisoner's
   dilemma},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {127},
Pages = {40-48},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Previous work with the spatial iterated prisoner's dilemma has shown
   that the ability to respond to a partner's defection by simply ``walking
   away{''} allows so-called walk away cooperators to outcompete defectors
   as well as cooperators that do not respond to defection. These findings
   are important because they suggest a relatively simple route by which
   cooperation can evolve. But it remains to be seen just how robust the
   walk away strategy is to ecologically important variables such as
   population density, strategic error, and offspring dispersal. The
   results of our simulation experiments show that the evolutionary success
   of walk away cooperators decreases with decreasing population density
   and/or with increasing error. This relationship is best explained by the
   ways in which population density and error jointly affect the
   opportunity cost of walking away. This opportunity cost also explains
   why naive cooperators regularly outcompete walk away cooperators in
   pair-wise competition, something not observed in previous studies. Our
   results further show that local offspring dispersal can inhibit the
   evolution of cooperation by negating the protection low population
   density affords the most vulnerable cooperators. Our research identifies
   socio-ecological conditions in which forgiveness trumps flight in the
   spatial iterated prisoner's dilemma. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {The distribution of allele frequencies obtained from diffusion
   approximations to Wright-Fisher models is useful in developing intuition
   about the population level effects of evolutionary processes. The
   statistical properties of the stationary distributions of K-allele
   models have been extensively studied under neutrality or under
   selection. Here, we introduce a new family of Wright-Fisher models in
   which there are two hierarchical levels of genetic variability. The
   genotypes composed of alleles differing from each other at the selected
   level have fitness differences with respect to each other and evolve
   under selection. The genotypes composed of alleles differing from each
   other only at the neutral level have the same fitness and evolve under
   neutrality. We show that with an appropriate scaling of the mutation
   parameter with respect to the number of alleles at each level, the
   frequencies of alleles at the selected and the neutral level are
   conditionally independent of each other, conditional on knowing the
   number of alleles at all levels. This conditional independence allows us
   to simulate from the joint stationary distribution of the allele
   frequencies. We use these simulated frequencies to perform inference on
   parameters of the model with two levels of genetic variability using
   Approximate Bayesian Computation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {A non-zero variance of Tajima's estimator for two sequences even for
   infinitely many unlinked loci},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {122},
Number = {SI},
Pages = {22-29},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The population-scaled mutation rate, theta, is informative on the
   effective population size and is thus widely used in population
   genetics. We show that for two sequences and n unlinked loci, the
   variance of Tajima's estimator ((theta) over cap), which is the average
   number of pairwise differences, does not vanish even as n -> infinity.
   The non-zero variance of (theta) over cap results from a (weak)
   correlation between coalescence times even at unlinked loci, which, in
   turn, is due to the underlying fixed pedigree shared by gene genealogies
   at all loci. We derive the correlation coefficient under a diploid,
   discrete-time, Wright-Fisher model, and we also derive a simple,
   closed-form lower bound. We also obtain empirical estimates of the
   correlation of coalescence times under demographic models inspired by
   large-scale human genealogies. While the effect we describe is small
   (Var {[}(theta) over cap] /theta(2) approximate to O (N-e(-1))), it is
   important to recognize this feature of statistical population genetics,
   which runs counter to commonly held notions about unlinked loci. (C)

Title = {Autocratic strategies for alternating games},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {113},
Pages = {13-22},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Repeated games have a long tradition in the behavioral sciences and
   evolutionary biology. Recently, strategies were discovered that permit
   an unprecedented level of control over repeated interactions by enabling
   a player to unilaterally enforce linear constraints on payoffs. Here, we
   extend this theory of ``zero-determinant{''} (or, more generally,
   ``autocratic{''}) strategies to alternating games, which are often
   biologically more relevant than traditional synchronous games.
   Alternating games naturally result in asymmetries between players
   because the first move matters or because players might not move with
   equal probabilities. In a strictly-alternating game with two players, X
   and Y, we give conditions for the existence of autocratic strategies for
   playerX when (i)X moves first and (ii) Y moves first. Furthermore, we
   show that autocratic strategies exist even for (iii) games with
   randomly-alternating moves. Particularly important categories of
   autocratic strategies are extortionate and generous strategies, which
   enforce unfavorable and favorable outcomes for the opponent,
   respectively. We illustrate these strategies using the continuous
   Donation Game, in which a player pays a cost to provide a benefit to the
   opponent according to a continuous cooperative investment level.
   Asymmetries due to alternating moves could easily arise from dominance
   hierarchies, and we show that they can endow subordinate players with
   more autocratic strategies than dominant players. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Title = {Estimation of the HIV-1 backward mutation rate from transmitted
   drug-resistant strains},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {112},
Pages = {33-42},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {One of the serious threats facing the administration of antiretroviral
   therapy to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infected patients is the
   reported increasing prevalence of transmitted drug resistance. However,
   given that HIV-1 drug-resistant strains are often less fit than the
   wild-type strains, it is expected that drug-resistant strains that are
   present during the primary phase of the HIV-1 infection are replaced by
   the fitter wild-type strains. This replacement of HIV-1 resistant
   mutations involves the emergence of wild-type strains by a process of
   backward mutation. How quickly the replacement happens is dependent on
   the class of HIV-1 mutation group.
   We estimate the backward mutation rates and relative fitness of various
   mutational groups known to confer HIV-1 drug resistance. We do this by
   fitting a stochastic model to data for individuals who were originally
   infected by an HIV-1 strain carrying any one of the known drug
   resistance-conferring mutations and observed over a period of time to
   see whether the resistant strain is replaced. To do this, we seek a
   distribution, generated from simulations of the stochastic model, that
   best describes the observed (clinical data) replacement times of a given
   mutation. We found that Lamivudine/Emtricitabine-associated mutations
   have a distinctly higher, backward mutation rate and low relative
   fitness compared to the other classes (as has been reported before)
   while protease inhibitors-associated mutations have a slower backward
   mutation rate and high relative fitness. For the other mutation classes,
   we found more uncertainty in their estimates. (C) 2016 The Author(s).

Title = {Inferring the demographic history from DNA sequences: An importance
   sampling approach based on non-homogeneous processes},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {111},
Pages = {16-27},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In Ait Kaci Azzou et al. (2015) we introduced an Importance Sampling
   (IS) approach for estimating the demographic history of a sample of DNA
   sequences, the skywis plot. More precisely, we proposed a new
   nonparametric estimate of a population size that changes over time. We
   showed on simulated data that the skywis plot can work well in typical
   situations where the effective population size does not undergo very
   steep changes. In this paper, we introduce an iterative procedure which
   extends the previous method and gives good estimates under such rapid
   variations. In the iterative calibrated skywis plot we approximate the
   effective population size by a piecewise constant function, whose values
   are re-estimated at each step. These piecewise constant functions are
   used to generate the waiting times of non homogeneous Poisson processes
   related to a coalescent process with mutation under a variable
   population size model. Moreover, the present IS procedure is based on a
   modified version of the Stephens and Donnelly (2000) proposal
   distribution. Finally, we apply the iterative calibrated skywis plot
   method to a simulated data set from a rapidly expanding exponential
   model, and we show that the method based on this new IS strategy
   correctly reconstructs the demographic history. (C) 2016 Published by

Title = {Eco-evolutionary dynamics of social dilemmas},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {111},
Pages = {28-42},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Social dilemmas are an integral part of social interactions. Cooperative
   actions, ranging from secreting extra-cellular products in microbial
   populations to donating blood in humans, are costly to the actor and
   hence create an incentive to shirk and avoid the costs. Nevertheless,
   cooperation is ubiquitous in nature. Both costs and benefits often
   depend non-linearly on the number and types of individuals involved as
   captured by idioms such as `too many cooks spoil the broth' where
   additional contributions are discounted, or `two heads are better than
   one' where cooperators synergistically enhance the group benefit.
   Interaction group sizes may depend on the size of the population and
   hence on ecological processes. This results in feedback mechanisms
   between ecological and evolutionary processes, which jointly affect and
   determine the evolutionary trajectory. Only recently combined
   eco-evolutionary processes became experimentally tractable in microbial
   social dilemmas. Here we analyse the evolutionary dynamics of nonlinear
   social dilemmas in settings where the population fluctuates in size and
   the environment changes over time. In particular, cooperation is often
   supported and maintained at high densities through ecological
   fluctuations. Moreover, we find that the combination of the two
   processes routinely reveals highly complex dynamics, which suggests
   common occurrence in nature. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {108},
Pages = {24-35},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {With the great advances in ancient DNA extraction, genetic data are now
   obtained from geographically separated individuals from both present and
   past. However, population genetics theory about the joint effect of
   space and time has not been thoroughly studied. Based on the classical
   stepping-stone model, we develop the theory of Isolation by distance and
   time. We derive the correlation of allele frequencies between demes in
   the case where ancient samples are present, and investigate the impact
   of edge effects with forward-in-time simulations. We also derive results
   about coalescent times in circular and toroidal models. As one of the
   most common ways to investigate population structure is principal
   components analysis (PCA), we evaluate the impact of our theory on PCA
   plots. Our results demonstrate that time between samples is an important
   factor. Ancient samples tend to be drawn to the center of a PCA plot.

Volume = {103},
Pages = {71-83},

Abstract = {This study develops a quantitative framework for estimating the effects
   of extreme suspended-sediment events (SSC > 25 mg L-1) on virtual
   populations of Chinook (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and coho (O. kisutch)
   salmon in a coastal watershed of British Columbia, Canada. We used a
   life history model coupled with a dose response model to evaluate the
   populations' responses to a set of simulated suspended sediments
   scenarios. Our results indicate that a linear increase in SSC produces
   non-linear declining trajectories in both Chinook and coho populations,
   but this decline was more evident for Chinook salmon despite their
   shorter fresh-water residence. The model presented here can provide
   insights into SSC impacts on population responses of salmoriids and
   potentially assist resource managers when planning conservation or
   remediation strategies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {103},
Pages = {27-37},

Abstract = {In a (two-type) Wright-Fisher diffusion with directional selection and
   two-way mutation, let x denote today's frequency of the beneficial type,
   and given x, let h(x) be the probability that, among all individuals of
   today's population, the individual whose progeny will eventually take
   over in the population is of the beneficial type. Fearnhead (2002) and
   Taylor (2007) obtained a series representation for h(x). We develop a
   construction that contains elements of both the ancestral selection
   graph and the lookdown construction and includes pruning of certain
   lines upon mutation. Besides being interesting in its own right, this
   construction allows a transparent derivation of the series coefficients
   of h(x) and gives them a probabilistic meaning. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Title = {A Darwinian approach to the origin of life cycles with group properties},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {102},
Pages = {76-84},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {A selective explanation for the evolution of multicellular organisms
   from unicellular ones requires knowledge of both selective pressures and
   factors affecting the response to selection. Understanding the response
   to selection is particularly challenging in the case of evolutionary
   transitions in individuality, because these transitions involve a shift
   in the very units of selection. We develop a conceptual framework in
   which three fundamental processes (growth, division, and splitting) are
   the scaffold for unicellular and multicellular life cycles alike. We (i)
   enumerate the possible ways in which these processes can be linked to
   create more complex life cycles, (ii) introduce three genes based on
   growth, division and splitting that, acting in concert, determine the
   architecture of the life cycles, and finally, (iii) study the evolution
   of the simplest five life cycles using a heuristic model of coupled
   ordinary differential equations in which mutations are allowed in the
   three genes. We demonstrate how changes in the regulation of three
   fundamental aspects of colonial form (cell size, colony size, and colony
   cell number) could lead unicellular life cycles to evolve into primitive
   multicellular life cycles with group properties. One interesting
   prediction of the model is that selection generally favors cycles with
   group level properties when intermediate body size is associated with
   lowest mortality. That is, a universal requirement for the evolution of
   group cycles in the model is that the size-mortality curve be U-shaped.
   Furthermore, growth must decelerate with size. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Title = {Estimating the scaled mutation rate and mutation bias with site
   frequency data},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {98},
Pages = {19-27},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The distribution of allele frequencies of a large number of biallelic
   sites is known as ``allele-frequency spectrum{''} or ``site-frequency
   spectrum{''} (SFS). Without selection and in regions of relatively high
   recombination rates, sites may be assumed to be independently and
   identically distributed. With a beta equilibrium distribution of allelic
   proportions and binomial sampling, a beta-binomial compound likelihood
   for each site results. The likelihood of the data and the posterior
   distribution of two parameters, scaled mutation rate theta and mutation
   bias alpha, is investigated in the general case and for small scaled
   mutation rates theta. In the general case, an expectation-maximization
   (EM) algorithm is derived to obtain maximum likelihood estimates of both
   parameters. With an appropriate prior distribution, a Markov chain Monte
   Carlo sampler to integrate the posterior distribution is also derived.
   As far as I am aware, previous maximum likelihood or Bayesian estimators
   of theta, explicitly or implicitly assume small scaled mutation rates,
   i.e., theta << 1. For theta << 1, maximum-likelihood estimators are also
   derived for both parameters using a Taylor series expansion of the
   beta-binomial distribution. The estimator of theta is a variant of the
   Ewens-Watterson estimator and of the maximum likelihood estimator
   derived with the Poisson Random Field approach. With a conjugate prior
   distribution, marginal and conditional beta posterior distributions are
   also derived for both parameters. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {Upper bounds on <i>F<sub>ST</sub></i> in terms of the frequency of the
   most frequent allele and total homozygosity: The case of a specified
   number of alleles},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {97},
Pages = {20-34},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {F-ST is one of the most frequently-used indices of genetic
   differentiation among groups. Though F-ST takes values between 0 and 1,
   authors going back to Wright have noted that under many circumstances,
   F-ST is constrained to be less than 1. Recently, we showed that at a
   genetic locus with an unspecified number of alleles, F-ST for two
   subpopulations is strictly bounded from above by functions of both the
   frequency of the most frequent allele (M) and the homozygosity of the
   total population (H-T). In the two-subpopulation case, F-ST can equal
   one only when the frequency of the most frequent allele and the total
   homozygosity are 1/2. Here, we extend this work by deriving strict
   bounds on F-ST for two subpopulations when the number of alleles at the
   locus is specified to be I. We show that restricting to I alleles
   produces the same upper bound on F-ST over much of the allowable domain
   for M and H-T, and we derive more restrictive bounds in the windows M is
   an element of{[}1/I, 1/(I - 1)) and H-T is an element of {[}1/I, I/(I-2
   - 1)). These results extend our understanding of the behavior of F-ST in
   relation to other population-genetic statistics. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Title = {Clines with complete dominance and partial panmixia in an unbounded
   unidimensional habitat},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {93},
Pages = {63-74},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {In spatially structured populations, global panmixia can be viewed as
   the limiting case of long-distance migration. The effect of
   incorporating partial panmixia into diallelic single-locus dines
   maintained by migration and selection with complete dominance in an
   unbounded unidimensional habitat is investigated. The population density
   is uniform. Migration and selection are both weak; the former is
   homogeneous and symmetric; the latter is frequency independent. The
   spatial factor (g) over tilde (x) in the selection term, where x denotes
   position, is a single step at the origin: (g) over tilde (x) = -alpha <
   0 if x < 0, and (g) over tilde (x) = 1 if x > 0. If alpha = I, there
   exists a globally asymptotically stable dine. For alpha < 1, such a
   cline exists if and only if the scaled panmictic rate p is less than the
   critical value /beta{*}{*} = 2 alpha/(1-alpha). For alpha > 1, a unique,
   asymptotically stable dine exists if and only if beta is less than the
   critical value beta{*}; then a smaller, unique, unstable equilibrium
   also exists whenever beta < beta{*}. Two coupled, nonlinear polynomial
   equations uniquely determine beta{*}. Explicit solutions are derived for
   each of the above equilibria. If beta > 0 and a dine exists, some
   polymorphism is maintained even at x = +/-infinity. Both the preceding
   result and the existence of an unstable equilibrium when alpha > 1 and 0
   < beta < beta{*} differ qualitatively from the classical case (beta =
   0). (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Facilitation of intraguild prey by its intraguild predator in a
   three-species Lotka-Volterra model},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {92},
Pages = {55-61},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Explaining the coexistence of multiple species in the competition and
   predation theatre has proven a great challenge. Traditional intraguild
   predation (IGP) models have only relatively small regions of stable
   coexistence of all species. Here, we investigate potential additional
   mechanisms that extend these regions of stable coexistence. We used a
   3-species Lotka-Volterra system to which we added an interaction term to
   model a unidirectional facilitative relationship between the two
   predators in the IGP. In this modelling study the IG predator was able
   to precondition a part of the common resource by an instantaneous
   manipulation, which resulted in the immobilization of the resource
   species. This mechanism of immobilization facilitated the resource
   uptake by the IG prey and thus increased its growth rates even in the
   presence of the common predator. The facilitative relationship of the IG
   prey by the IG predator produced a stable coexistence of both predators
   even though the IG prey was an inferior competitor for a common
   resource, which cannot be attained with the traditional IGP models.
   Furthermore, our model predicted a 3-species stable coexistence even at
   high enrichment where no coexistence was found in the basic IGP model.
   Thus, we showed that diversity of resource traits could significantly
   alter emergent community patterns via shifts in exploitative competition
   of IGP-related predators. The described mechanism could potentially lead
   to a higher efficiency in exploitation of common resources and thus
   promote higher diversity in a real community. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All

Title = {Evolution of learning strategies in temporally and spatially variable
   environments: A review of theory},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {91},
Pages = {3-19},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The theoretical literature from 1985 to the present on the evolution of
   learning strategies in variable environments is reviewed, with the focus
   on deterministic dynamical models that are amenable to local stability
   analysis, and on deterministic models yielding evolutionarily stable
   strategies. Individual learning, unbiased and biased social learning,
   mixed learning, and learning schedules are considered. A rapidly
   changing environment or frequent migration in a spatially heterogeneous
   environment favors individual learning over unbiased social learning.
   However, results are not so straightforward in the context of learning
   schedules or when biases in social learning are introduced. The three
   major methods of modeling temporal environmental change coevolutionary,
   two-timescale, and information decay are compared and shown to sometimes
   yield contradictory results. The so-called Rogers' paradox is inherent
   in the two-timescale method as originally applied to the evolution of
   pure strategies, but is often eliminated when the other methods are
   used. Moreover, Rogers' paradox is not observed for the mixed learning
   strategies and learning schedules that we review. We believe that
   further theoretical work is necessary on learning schedules and biased
   social learning, based on models that are logically consistent and
   empirically pertinent. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {An SIS model for cultural trait transmission with conformity bias},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {90},
Pages = {56-63},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Epidemiological models have been applied to human health-related
   behaviors that are affected by social interaction. Typically these
   models have not considered conformity bias, that is, the exaggerated
   propensity to adopt commonly observed behaviors or opinions, or content
   biases, where the content of the learned trait affects the probability
   of adoption. Here we consider an interaction of these two effects,
   presenting an SIS-type model for the spread and persistence of a
   behavior which is transmitted via social learning. Uptake is controlled
   by a nonlinear dependence on the proportion of individuals demonstrating
   the behavior in a population. Three equilibrium solutions are found,
   their linear stability is analyzed and the results are compared with a
   model for unbiased social learning. Our analysis focuses on the effects
   of the strength of conformity bias and the effects of content biases
   which alter a conformity threshold frequency of the behavior, above
   which there is an exaggerated propensity for adoption. The strength of
   the conformity bias is found to qualitatively alter the predictions
   regarding whether the trait becomes endemic within the population and
   the proportion of individuals who display the trait when it is endemic.
   As the conformity strength increases, the number of feasible equilibrium
   solutions increases from two to three, leading to a situation where the
   stable equilibrium attained is dependent upon the initial state. Varying
   the conformity threshold frequency directionally alters the behavior
   invasion threshold. Finally we discuss the possible application of this
   model to binge drinking behavior. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {Exclusion and spatial segregation in the apparent competition between
   two hosts sharing macroparasites},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {86},
Pages = {12-22},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In this paper we investigate the spatial dynamics of a deterministic
   model describing two host species that partially share a common spatial
   domain, experiencing apparent competition mediated by macroparasites.
   The aim of this work is to understand the mechanisms underlying apparent
   competition processes in a spatially structured environment, which have
   been generally overlooked up to now.
   First, we analyse the behaviour of a single-host macroparasite partial
   differential equation (PDE) model, both in the cases of uniform or
   spatially-dependent vital rates of the host, focusing on the role of
   spatial diffusion on parasite persistence and host abundance. We
   obtained the threshold condition for parasite persistence, and (in
   contrast to what occurs in reaction-diffusion models for an isolated
   population) we found that, in the case of spatially-dependent vital
   rates, increasing the host diffusion coefficient results in an increase
   of the overall host population.
   Then, a PDE model featuring spatial diffusion and apparent competition
   mediated via shared macroparasites between two species is analysed in
   order to understand the role of spatial heterogeneity in host
   coexistence. We assumed a partial overlap among the habitats of the two
   species and found that the shared parasites could cause, depending on
   the values of the diffusion coefficients and differences in induced
   mortality among host species, a decrease of the realized habitat and,
   eventually, the extinction of the species less tolerant to parasite
   infection. This shows that the presence of regulating parasites
   complicates the effect of dispersal on population dynamics and that the
   dynamics of apparent competition cannot be adequately understood from
   spatially-independent models. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {Dynamics of sexual populations structured by a space variable and a

Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {84},
Pages = {87-103},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {We study sexual populations structured by a phenotypic trait and a space
   variable, in a non-homogeneous environment. Departing from an
   infinitesimal model, we perform an asymptotic limit to derive the system
   introduced in Kirkpatrick and Barton (1997). We then perform a further
   simplification to obtain a simple model. Thanks to this simpler
   equation, we can describe rigorously the dynamics of the population. In
   particular, we provide an explicit estimate of the invasion speed, or
   extinction speed of the species. Numerical computations show that this
   simple model provides a good approximation of the original infinitesimal
   model, and in particular describes quite well the evolution of the
   species' range. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},
